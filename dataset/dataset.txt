1.1: Was There Water on Ancient Mars?
Despite Mars's bleak, cold climate today, there is abundant geologic evidence that liquid
water once flowed on the Martian surface (and even recent evidence that some water still
periodically flows today). The evidence of past flows includes river channels, now dry, that
were once carved by powerful floods; valley networks of branching streams and
tributaries indicating precipitation falling over wide areas; river deltas and layered
sediments suggesting flow into standing bodies of liquid water; and salt and other
minerals that dissolved in liquid water and were left behind when water evaporated. When
that ancient wet period existed and when it ended is difficult to say.
The best method for dating a surface uses radioactivity, the process by which certain
elements decay over time. One collects rocks from the surface and measures their
radioactive elements to see how much of the decay products have accumulated in the
rock since it formed. Transferring this age to the age of the surface can be tricky unless
one knows where the rock came from. And one needs to collect the samples and bring
them to a well-equipped laboratory.
The other way to date a planetary surface, which is used when rock samples are
unavailable, is by counting craters. The longer a surface has been exposed to meteorite
bombardment, the more craters it will have. This gives the relative age and allows one to
determine which surfaces are older and which surfaces are younger. To get the actual
age, one needs a standard. This was established for the Moon when lunar samples were
returned to Earth as part of the United States Apollo program. The crater counts of the
areas of the Moon from which the samples came were carefully noted. The samples were
dated in terrestrial laboratories using radioactive decay, and the relation between absolute
age in years and crater density--numbers per unit area-was determined. This relation is
valid for the Moon, and it is possible that it is valid for Mars as well. Then counting craters
on a Martian surface should yield its actual age. It is possible, however, that the number
of impacting objects is different for Mars. The problem has been carefully studied, and
adjustments have been made, but the general conclusion is that a wet period occurred
early in Mars's 4.5 billion-year history.
This causes a problem for Mars’s climate science because the Sun was supposed to be
fainter, perhaps by 20 or 30 percent, during Mars’s wet period. Yet a watery Mars arguably
would have required relatively warm temperatures. The power output of the Sun-its
luminosity over time-is based on models of its interior and evolution. The models are welltested and agree with the luminosities of stars like the Sun, whose ages are known. The
same problem exists for Earth, which appears to have been warmer billions of years ago
than it is today. Geologists have called this the "faint young Sun paradox." The solution
to the paradox probably lies in climate science and not in the theory of stellar evolution,
but the issue has not been entirely settled.
If Mars was wet billions of years ago, was it also warm? There could have been
Page 7 of 269
catastrophic floods released from underground aquifers (layers of rocks that can contain
water) where the top surface of the water froze like the top of a Hawailan lava flow. The
solid crust forms an insulating layer, trapping the heat of the liquid and allowing it to flow
for great distances without freezing. Lava tubes on Hawalil are empty channels where
lava once flowed in this way. Thus, the climate of Mars could have been wet but not warm,
with the water flowing entirely under the ice. Ice sheets and glaciers on Earth today have
extensive plumbing systems that allow water to flow and then drain away. Liquid water at
the base of glaciers acts as a temporary lubricant and allows them to surge and slide
downhill. Flood channels, river deltas, and standing bodies of liquid water all could have
existed on Mars under thick layers of ice. The wet-but-not-warm hypothesis has the most
trouble with areas that imply sources like precipitation over a wide area rather than the
bursting of an underground aquifer. Further study of Mars's geology will clarify these
issues.

1.1: Guam and the Brown Tree Snake
Guam is the largest island of Micronesia and, like many islands, once provided a home
to a fantastic assemblage of native birds, reptiles, and mammals. The vast majority of
these species are now extinct, and the remaining ones are threatened with extinction.
Although many factors contributed to the loss of species, the principal cause is the
invasive brown tree snake.
During the Second World War, the United States Navy established a large naval base on
Guam. With the end of the war in 1945, the base proved useful for recovering abandoned
war materials from the region, in particular, vehicles, aircraft, and other supplies from New
Guinea, where these items may have sat unused for some time. The brown tree snake is
native to New Guinea and other regions of Australasia. It is typically nocturnal and, during
the day, rests within crevices and holes that provide good cover. It is commonly found in
wheel wells on airplanes, under the hoods of cars, and in boxes of cargo, and most
biologists think the brown tree snake was a hitchhiker within surplus Navy equipment
brought to Guam from New Guinea in the postwar years of 1945-1950.
The brown tree snake was first noticed along Guam's southern shore near Apra Harbor.
It then spread, somewhat slowly, until it occupied the entire island by 1970. Guam has no
native snakes and no native predators that could have controlled tree snake numbers.
Instead, the native vertebrates were all small species vulnerable to predation by the
generalist tree snakes. The decline of most native forest animals was immediate and
dramatic. Guam's Division of Aquatic and Wildlife Resources discontinued surveys of
native birds and bats in the 1970s, as there were so few individuals of these species to
count. The three native birds and mammals that persisted the longest were the Mariana
fruit bat, Guam rail, and island swiftlet. The fruit bat and rail were relatively long-lived
species that likely persisted simply because some individuals escaped predation and
lived out the remainder of their lives; however, neither species had any reproductive
success in the presence of the tree snake. The island swiftlet persists to this day but is
confined to one cave on Guam. The swiftlet builds nests on the walls of caves using its
own saliva and mud to adhere the nest to the cave wall. Despite this unusual habit,
swiftlets are still vulnerable to tree snake predation, as tree snakes can easily capture
prey in total darkness and climb most surfaces. The one cave where swiftlet persists is
unique in that the cave walls are not textured enough for snakes to support themselves.
This does not inhibit the swiftlet's ability to build nests, but it does prohibit tree snakes
from reaching those nests.
There have been many other losses of native forest animals on Guam. Consequently, the
food web of Guam's forests (the dominant native habitat) has shifted dramatically. The
most striking change is the reorganization of the web to one in which most components
are non-native. Beyond the brown tree snake, the Polynesian rat, Philippine turtledove,
and the house mouse, among other non-native species, have been successively
established. Three native lizards survive in Guam's forests. All the lizards are small and
Page 9 of 269
active during daylight. One would assume that, with the destruction of the native food
web, the brown tree snake would suffer from a lack of food resources, but the available
pool of invasive prey and native lizards maintains tree snake densities. Consequently,
native species went extinct with no corresponding negative effect on the tree snake. The
tree snake even seems to be adapting to the diurnal habits of the remaining native lizards
since biologists have documented a shift in the tree snake's previously nocturnal activity
pattern to one that Increasingly includes activity during daylight hours.
The reduction in the complexity of the Guam food web has had consequences beyond
the loss of native animals. The loss of mammalian and avian insectivores presumably
increased insect abundance at some cost to agricultural crops and crop production. And
newly introduced non-native species may find it easy to invade Guam, given the many
"open niches" left by the loss of native species.

2.1: The Most Common Bird on Earth
The red-billed quelea is a small, mostly brown bird found in the annual grasslands of
Africa. Other than ornithologists and the people who see the bird in its native habitat,
almost no one has ever heard of the little quelea, although, with a population estimated
at 10 billion, it may be the most common bird on Earth.
Given the seemingly stressful conditions in the environments where the birds are found,
it is surprising that the red-billed quelea survives at all, much less that it is so remarkably
successful. Queleas feed on native annual grasses. Any animal that feeds primarily on
the seeds of annual grasses has a potentially major problem-its food supply periodically
appears and then disappears. A wide range of adaptations allow annual-seed eaters to
survive. For example, rodents in annual grasslands often store their extra seeds to survive
lean times, an adaptation that was taken up by human populations once they
domesticated and became dependent on annual grasses, such as barley and wheat. If
they are to survive, queleas must also cope with the challenging feast-or-famine situation
of attending annual-grass feeders. One might expect such species to be regularly wiped
out (at least locally) when fluctuations in the growing season result in seed failures of their
food. The red-billed quelea copes well enough to be the world's most common bird.
Part of the quelea's success arises from its life-history adjustments to its environment.
Over the African dry season, the species has to subsist on the ever-diminishing supply of
seeds produced by the annual grasses at the end of the last wet season. As food becomes
scarcer, the species feeds actively and gains sufficient weight reserves to be able to
migrate to more auspicious areas. With the onset of rains in the African wet season, the
seeds that queleas eat germinate (develop) and so are no longer available for food. The
resulting severe food shortage lasts six to eight weeks. The birds are forced to migrate to
better situations (if they can find them). For red-billed queleas, the savannas in which they
live are an ever-shifting mosaic of patches of varying suitability depending on their recent
rainfall history; some areas have dry seeds; others have immature grasses, mature
grasses with abundant green seeds, or old grasses with no seed. By moving over
distances of 30 to 120 miles (50 to 200 km), the birds subsist in an inhospitable universe
by moving from one patch of habitat with suitable food to another.
The so-called early-rains migration ends when queleas return to formerly abandoned
locations. By this time, the rains have come, and grass seeds have germinated. The new
grasses mature, and eventually, fresh green seeds become available, ending the local
food shortage. Then, queleas establish communal breeding colonies in appropriate
locations. They typically nest in thorny acacia trees. Their breeding colonies can contain
several million pairs of breeding birds and can cover tens of hectares. The entire breeding
cycle, from nesting colony, to independent-fledged young, requires six weeks-an
exceptionally short interval for birds. The biological synchrony found among the birds in
a breeding colony can be remarkable. Millions of eggs in millions of nests hatch on the
same day. The fall of eggshells from the subsequent dropping of the shells from the nests
Page 11 of 269
after these synchronous hatchings have been likened to a snowstorm. Sometimes the dry
season comes early, and the breeding areas dry out prematurely. In such times, the
breeding colonies are abandoned. In other instances, the rains may sustain a prolonged
green period, and several episodes of breeding can occur in the same general area.
Since red-billed queleas feed on the seeds of annual grasses, they are preadapted to be
effective feeders on the seeds of domesticated annual grasses as well. As human
agriculture has planted more and more cereal grains across Africa, the number of quelea
have exploded in response to the abundance of suitable food. The quelea's magnitude
as a pest animal has increased correspondingly. Although the numbers may be
overestimated, the species is certainly capable of destroying 10 to 20 percent of the
production of large farms and the entire crop of small, independent farmers. The redbilled quelea is not only the most abundant bird; it can also be described as the most
destructive pest bird on Earth.

2.2: Iron in Ancient Africa
Metal-production technologies (metallurgy) have had a profound influence on the course
of human history. Aside from gold, used for jewelry and ornamentation, the first metal to
be widely used was copper, with smelting (the process of extracting metal from ore by
heating) beginning by 5000 B.C.E. in modern-day Serbia. Production of bronze from
copper and tin began by 2800 B.C.E. in Anatolia, in what is modern-day Turkey. Next was
iron, with smelting starting around 1500 B.C.E. in Anatolia and spreading to Europe by
1100 B.C.E. Although iron production was difficult and complex, this metal's greater
hardness made tools and weapons far superior to those made from copper and bronze.
For a long time, scholars believed that iron production came to sub-Saharan Africa from
Anatolia. One reason for this is that iron smelting requires considerable knowledge and
experience, yet there was no evidence of previous metals technology in Africa. In
particular, there seemed to have been no copper metallurgy, a likely precursor to iron
production. Since Anatolia did possess the necessary knowledge and skill, it seemed to
be a plausible source.
Some of the first evidence for African iron production was found in Meroe and dated to
around 500 B.C.E.: iron tools and weapons, the remains of furnaces, and a large number
of heaps of slag (waste left behind after processing metallic ores). This was significant
because the kingdom of Meroe had close contact with Egypt to the north, where iron
production had been imported from Anatolia and was known by 670 B.C.E. Therefore, it
seemed logical that iron technology had diffused southward through Egypt to Meroe and
from Meroe to sub-Saharan Africa. Some archaeologists have proposed a different
source: Carthage, a North African city on the Mediterranean coast founded around 800
B.C.E. by the Phoenicians, whose homeland was close to Anatolia. However, no direct
archaeological evidence for iron smelting has been found in Carthage, and it is not easy
to explain how such knowledge and skill could have crossed the Sahara desert to reach
the sub-Saharan regions. Also, it appears that the earliest iron production south of the
desert predates Carthage's founding.
Although it seems clear that iron technology reached Meroe from Anatolia via Egypt,
recent research shows that the rest of Africa developed the technology independently.
There is evidence of iron working as early as 1000 B.C.E. in Central Africa, and iron
smelters were in use in the Great Lakes region of East Africa around 900 B.C., both earlier
than would have been possible if the technologies had diffused from Anatolia through
Egypt. Iron production was widespread in West and East Africa as early as 600 B.C.E.,
and it reached southern Africa a few hundred years later. Not only do such dates precede
those of Meroe's iron production, but the design of the smelters differs significantly from
that of the smelters at Merod. Also, there are recent indications that sub-Saharan Africa
had copper technology in place as early as 2200B.C.E., long before iron production
began. Aside from the knowledge gained from copper technology, some experience may
have come from pottery production. Since around 4000 B.C.E., crushed iron ore was used
Page 13 of 269
to coat pottery in Egypt, and the temperatures necessary for this were almost as high as
those needed for iron smelting.
The diffusion of iron technology through Africa was relatively slow, possibly as a result of
the scarcity of iron ore. It also did not have the immediate impact of other technologies
(such as steam power in the modem era), but iron tools made hunting easier and
facilitated tasks such as shaping wood, building houses, and digging wells. Iron
technology certainly helped farmers and so accelerated the spread of agricultural
communities in West Africa after 400 B.C.E., such as those of the upper Niger River,
where farming settlements began to form clusters of villages that specialized in rice,
cotton, or dried fish, and eventually developed into large market towns. However, the
rarity of major iron deposits meant that iron tools, weapons, and other goods had to be
transported over long distances. Along with the difficulty of iron production, this probably
gave iron workers an honored place in the community.

3.1: Vasari, Art, and the Renaissance
The Italian artist, architect, and author Giorgio Vasari was an important influence on the
modern Western conception of art. In his Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors
and Architects, a series of biographies of artists published in 1550, Vasari coins a word
to describe the art made by the genius Michelangelo Buonarotti (1475-1564) and other
painters, sculptors, and architects only slightly less talented than Buonarotti: Renaissance
(rinascita, or "rebirth," in Italian). Although the artists Vasari discussed were not the first
to take great interest in the art of ancient Greece and Rome-writers and thinkers of the
fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries, such as Petrarch (1304-1374) and Lorenzo Valla
(1407-1457), had already seen themselves as reinvigorators of the Greek and Roman
past-Vasari thought the rebirth of the late fifteenth century had gone beyond the original.
In Vasari's eyes, Buonarotti and his contemporaries were not simply skilled and highly
trained artisans, but "rare men of genius" who should sign their names to and take full
credit for their work. (Traditionally, artists did not sign their names to artworks.) This notion
of the artist as creative genius did not apply to all branches of art but to those in Vasari's
title-painting, sculpture, and architecture-which were subsequently judged to be the major
arts. Other types of art, such as needlework, porcelain manufacture, goldsmithing, and
furniture making, were minor arts, decorative arts, or crafts, and the names of those who
made them were not considered important.
Along with inventing the term "Renaissance," Vasari influenced how Westerners
understood other aspects of art and culture. He is often regarded as the first art historian,
and his categories continue to shape the way that art history is taught and museums are
arranged. Vasari's term "Renaissance" came to be used for a whole era and not simply
its art. Because it derived from broad cultural changes and not specific events, the
Renaissance happened at different times in different parts of Europe. "Renaissance" is
used to describe fifteenth-century Italian paintings, sixteenth-century English literature,
and seventeenth-century Scandinavian architecture. Some scholars see the
Renaissance as the beginning of the modern era, while others see it as a sort of transition
between medieval and modern.
Vasari's distinction between art (works made by "rare men of genius") and craft(works
made by everyone else) has been extended to other cultural realms in Europe: certain
forms of writing, such as poetry, history, and epics, came to be defined as literature, while
other types of writing, such as letters and diaries, were excluded from this category;
certain forms of music became classical, while everything else was popular or folk;
instruction that occurred in institutional settings was education, while that going on in the
family or workshop was training or tradition. Scholars traced a growing split between
professional and amateur, and, to a lesser degree, between learned and popular culture.
Research into all aspects of cultural life over the last several decades, however, has
pointed out that the divisions between art and craft and learned and popular are more
pronounced in hindsight than they were at the time. Vasari may have prized painting,
Page 15 of 269
sculpture, and architecture, but patrons carefully ordered and paid enormous amounts for
candlesticks, silver and gold tableware enamel or jewel-encrusted dishes, embroidery
(cloth with decorative needlework), and enormous tapestries, along with paintings and
statues. Embroiderers as well as painters experimented with perspective (the
representation of three-dimensional space on a two-dimensional plane), paid great
attention to proportion, shadowing, and naturalistic representation, and took their subjects
from Greek and Roman antiquity. Writers paid as much, or even more, attention to literary
conventions (standard practices) in their letters than in their poetry or drama. Folktales
told orally for centuries became part of literary works in many countries, and people telling
stories increasingly included those that someone had read in a book. Highly learned
individuals participated in festivities involving all kinds of people that poked fun at their
own intellectual pretensions and satirized various forms of power and status. Educated
individuals did form a community among themselves with concerns different from the vast
majority of the population, but they also shared many values and traditions with their
neighbors who lacked extensive formal education.

3.2: Life in an Estuary
An estuary is the wide part of a river where it flows into the sea. It is affected by both
marine influences (tides, waves, and the influx of saline water) and riverine influences
(flows of fresh water and sediment) and is, therefore, not a perfectly stable environment.
As a result, an estuary contains fewer resident species than the nearby marine or
freshwater ecosystems, resulting in less competition for food and space. Because there
is less competition, many estuarine species tend to be generalists; that is, they are able
to consume a variety of foods, depending on what is available. Species that can tolerate
the salinity and temperature changes in estuaries can exploit the area's high productivity,
grow rapidly, and multiply into enormous populations.
Many marine animals have body fluids that contain about the same concentration of salts
as seawater and that are essentially isosmotic to the surrounding water; that is, the
pressure of their body fluids is equal to the pressure of the seawater, and they neither
gain nor lose water. Because the marine environment remains relatively constant, they
do not have a problem maintaining water balance. Animals that live in estuaries, however,
must have some physiological mechanism for dealing with the varying salinity; otherwise,
their tissues and cells would absorb water and lose salts as they encounter an
environment with lower salinity than the sea. Thus, estuarine animals are either
osmoconformers, which survive by having tissues and cells that tolerate the loss of salts
through dilution, or osmoregulators, which maintain an optimal salt concentration in their
tissues regardless of the salt content of their environment.
Animals such as jellyfish are unable to actively adjust the amount of water in their tissues.
When their environment becomes less saline, their body fluid gains water and loses ions
until it is isosmotic to the surroundings. These organisms are examples of
osmoconformers. The ability of osmoconformers to inhabit estuaries is limited by their
tolerance for changes in their body fluid. In contrast to osmoconformers, osmoregulators
employ a variety of strategies to maintain a constant salt concentration in their bodies.
Osmoregulators that live in estuarine waters concentrate salts in their body fluids when
the concentration of salts in the surrounding water decreases. For instance, some crabs
and fish regulate their salt content in less-saline water by actively absorbing salt ions
through the gills to compensate for salt ions lost from their body. This helps them to
maintain a relatively constant body fluid. Some animals can either concentrate salts when
their environment is less saline or excrete salts when the environment is extremely salty.
The latter are generally animals that live partly on land or in areas such as salt marshes
and mangrove swamps that occasionally receive large amounts of rain. Other animals,
such as the blue crab, are osmorcgulators at lower environmental salinity and
osmoconformers at higher environmental salinity. Many fish species are osmoregulators
that can adjust to both high-salt and low-salt environments.
Some estuarine organisms wall themselves off from their external environment to
decrease water and salt exchange with their surroundings. Many estuarine animals have
Page 17 of 269
body surfaces that are less permeable than those of purely marine forms. This decreased
permeability can be the result of increased amounts of calcium in the exoskeleton (outer
skeleton) or increased numbers of mucous glands in the skin.
In addition to changes in salinity, the problem of remaining stationary in a changing
environment affects the distribution of organisms in estuaries. The more or less constant
movement of water in an estuary makes it difficult for some organisms to remain
stationary long enough to feed and carry on other vital functions. Because of this, survival
favors organisms that are benthic - those that live at the bottom. Marine plants and algae
in estuaries have substantial root systems or holdfasts, to prevent moving water from
pulling them up and carrying them out to sea. Animals live attached to the bottom, either
in the available spaces around other sedentary animals and plants or buried in the small
crevices between sediment particles.

4.1: Evidence for Continental Drift
Continental drift refers to the idea that the present continents once formed a single, giant
continent called Pangaea, and since that time, has been slowly drifting apart. In 1915, the
originator of this idea, the German meteorologist Alfred Wegener, was impressed by the
close resemblance of coastlines of continents on opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean,
particularly South America and Africa. However, the configuration of the coastlines results
from erosional and depositional processes and therefore is constantly being modified, so
even if Wegener was right and the continents had separated in the distant past, it is not
likely that the coastlines would fit exactly. But decades later, it was shown that the
continents fit together well along the continental slope (the broad underwater shelf on the
edges of continents), where erosion is minimal, and recent studies have confirmed the
close fit between continents when they are reassembled to form Pangaea.
If the continents were at one time joined, then the rocks and mountain ranges of the same
age in adjoining locations on opposite continents should closely match. Such is the case
for the continents thought to have together formed the southern supercontinent
Gondwana, when Pangaea broke up into a northern and a southern supercontinent,
mostly during the Jurassic period (200-146 million years ago), Antarctica, South America,
Africa, Australia-New Guinea, and India comprised Gondwana. Marine, nonmarine, and
glacial rock sequences of the Pennsylvanian epoch (325-299 million years ago) to the
Jurassic period are almost identical for all five Gondwana continents, strongly indicating
that they were joined at one time. The trends of several major mountain ranges also
support the hypothesis of continental drift. The folded Appalachian Mountains of North
America, for example, trend northeastward through the eastern United States and
Canada and terminate abruptly at the Newfoundland coastline. Mountain ranges of the
same age and deformational style occur in eastern Greenland, Ireland, Great Britain, and
Norway. Even though these mountain ranges are currently separated by the Atlantic
Ocean, they form an essentially continuous mountain range when the continents are
positioned next to each other.
During the later part of the Paleozoic era (544-255 million years ago), massive glaciers
covered large continental areas of the Southern Hemisphere, leaving behind layers of till
(sediment deposited by glaciers) and striations (scratch marks) in the bedrock beneath
the till. Fossils and sedimentary rocks of the same age from the Northern Hemisphere,
however, give no indication of glaciation. Fossil plants found in coals indicate that the
Northern Hemisphere had a tropical climate during the time that the Southern Hemisphere
was glaciated.
All the Gondwana continents except Antarctica are currently located near the equator in
subtropical to tropical climates. Mapping of glacial striations in bedrock in Australia, India,
and South America indicates that the glaciers moved from the areas of present-day
oceans onto land. This would be highly unlikely because large continental glaciers (such
as occurred on the Gondwana continents during the late Paleozoic era) flow outward from
Page 19 of 269
their central area of accumulation toward the sea. If the continents had not moved in the
past, one would have to explain how glaciers moved from the oceans onto land and how
large-scale continental glaciers formed near the equator. But if the continents are
reassembled as a single landmass with South Africa located at the South Pole, the
direction of movement of late Paleozoic continental glaciers makes sense. Furthermore,
this geographic arrangement places the northern continents nearer the tropics, which is
consistent with the fossil and climatologic evidence.
Finally, some of the most compelling evidence for continental drift comes from the fossil
record. For example, fossils of Glossopteris, a group of woody shrubs, are found in
equivalent Pennsylvanian and Permian coal deposits (299-251 million years ago) on all
five Gondwana continents. Glassopteris shrubs produced seeds too large to have been
carried by winds, and even if the seeds had floated across the ocean, they would not
have remained viable for any length of time in salt water. The present-day-climates of the
southern continents range from tropical to polar and are much too diverse to support the
type of plants in the Glossopteris flora. These continents must once have been joined so
that these widely separated localities were all in the same latitudinal climatic belt.

4.2: Han Dynasty Tomb Sculpture
Stone sculpture was something of a latecomer to Chinese art, starting a thousand years
after figures were being made in jade and bronze. Under the first period of the Han
dynasty, known as the Western Han (206 B.C.E. 9 B.C.E.), it was used mainly for the
tombs (burial chambers) of emperors or local rulers, but by the Eastern Han (25 C.E. -
220 B.C.E.), the second period of Han rule, it had spread more widely. This change was
largely the result of the increased importance of the tomb in the political philosophy of the
time. The early Western Han emperors, faced with the problem of forging a unified empire
threatened by uprisings on the part of ambitious rival kingdoms, had retained many of the
first emperor's policies based on military force and harsh laws. But by the middle of the
first century B.C.E., these were being replaced by an adaptation of the ideas of the fifthcentury B.C.E. philosopher Confucius, whose philosophy emphasized personal and
governmental morality, to the conditions of a united empire. Believing that in the long run,
stability depended on an acceptance of the legitimacy of the ruler (and dynasty) rather
than on military force, Han intellectuals and officials adopted a moral philosophy based
on the belief that humans are perfectible through education and that a hierarchical society
consists of a network of reciprocal duties and obligations: the subject's duty to obey the
ruler was matched by the ruler's obligation to care for his subjects.
The increased emphasis on civic duty and order encouraged stability, loyalty, and
obedience to the state, reinforcing central power. At the same time, the insistence on the
value of education attracted intellectuals into state service, providing a well-qualified
administration. In an age of rising standards of living with the growth of upwardly mobile
merchant and artisan classes, the importance of filial piety (respect for parents and
ancestors), one of the greatest of Confucian virtues, led to competitive tomb building. The
imperial mausoleums (aboveground, free-standing tombs constructed as memorials) set
the example, and their extravagance was copied downwards. But why was there such an
urgent building of mausoleums?
A change in ritual had increased both the importance of the tomb and the scope for
display. The ancestral rites previously held in city or palace temples were transferred to
the tomb itself, making it necessary to build a hall south of the grave mound where the
sacrifices could be performed. To emphasize the importance of the site, the approach
was lined with an avenue of stone monuments known as the spirit road" since it was along
this road that the deceased would travel to the grave. This innovation became popular in
Han society. It spread from the emperor to other parts of Han society, eventually crossing
into neighboring lands such as Korea and Vietnam. The result was a manifold expansion
in the use of stone statuary. No longer the prerogative of a few, it was now open to citizens
anxious to display their piety and wealth by erecting free-standing stone statues on their
fathers' graves. The use of statuary spread so rapidly that, in order to prevent a complete
devaluation of its status, it was controlled by imperial decree, and henceforth, the number
and subject matter of spirit road statues were regulated according to the social rank of
the deceased.
Page 21 of 269
More tomb statuary has survived than any other form of Han statuary, and the easiest
way to see the development of sculpture during the first and second centuries is to use
the tomb as a starting place. During the first century B.C.E., there appears to have been
a remarkable increase in the use of stone in connection with the tomb. While free-standing
statues and monuments were placed on the tomb above ground, the interior of stone and
brick tomb chambers below were adorned with carvings of figures on walls and
engravings on walls and doors. Features previously made in wood, such as coffins and
steles (vertical markers placed in the ground to memorialize the dead), were now carved
in stone. Above and below ground, tomb layout and ornamentation followed a coordinated
plan. The same images and themes reappear in different places, and the tasks of the
tomb are clearly allocated between different media. The result is an unparalleled picture
of contemporary life and thought.

5.1: Aztec Artisans
Most of the material objects produced by the Aztec people of central Mexico during the
Late Postclassic period (1350-1521) were manufactured in household settings by
household members. Craft skills and knowledge, from weaving to metalwork, were
passed from parent to child. Some objects were produced in small amounts strictly for
household consumption, but many goods were produced in larger quantities and destined
for market exchange. Specialization in the production of goods reached a high level of
diversity and intensity during these times. In part, this was possible because of the food
surpluses created by increasingly intense systems of agriculture, complemented by an
abundance of nonagricultural resources. These surpluses released some persons, either
partially or fully, from food-getting activities, allowing them to concentrate their time and
energy on pursuing other production activities. High levels of craft production were also
related somewhat to the population surge in the Late Postclassic period, providing large
groups of producers and consumers of goods. And also, in part, these specializations
were stimulated and maintained by the increasing commercialization of the Late
Postclassic period, facilitating relatively efficient and effective flows of raw materials and
finished goods on local, regional, and extra-regional levels.
Where artisans produced their crafts reflected, to some extent, their organization and
sociopolitical context. Artisans were either "attached" or "independent." The former were
situated in or near palaces, suggesting elite economic, social, and/or political
relationships. This particularly applied to some luxury artisans who enjoyed the patronage
(support) of the local ruler. These artisans were assured access to raw materials as well
as guaranteed consumers. For instance, the Tenochtitlan-Tlate featherworkers attached
to the Tenochtitlan ruler's palace enjoyed access to the ruler's aviary and stored tributes
and were specifically employed to produce ornate featherwork for the ruler's fine attire,
for exquisite gifts for the ruler's diplomatic guests, and to adorn the god Huitzilopochtli. It
appears that these highly esteemed artisans were resettled in or near the palace, yet it
also seems that the household structure of production was maintained. That is, it is likely
that entire households were relocated, allowing for the household's division of labor to be
maintained. Other artisans attached to the royal palace in Tenochtitlan included gold
workers and silversmiths, coppersmiths, painters, cutters of stones, greenstone mosaic
workers, and woodcarvers, all of whom worked at or near the totocalli, or birdhouse.
Artisans continued to be attached to native nobles even after the Spanish conquest of the
Aztec empire. Don Juan de Guzman, a native governor of Coyoacan (an area near
Tenochtitlan) who was appointed by the Spanish in the mid-sixteenth century, enjoyed the
privilege of having "all the artisans and craftsmen be attached to the royal house to do
what is needed." Ten carpenters and ten stonemasons were also attached to Don Juan,
but we know little about them beyond that he was having a house built, and "they are to
do what is needed." Prior to the Spanish conquest, when king Motecuhzoma Xocoyotzin
employed sculptors to carve a statue of him, he paid them handsomely for their work.
Perhaps these were independent artisans, although the payment could as well represent
Page 23 of 269
compensation to attached artisans. While royal or elite sponsorship provided attached
artisans with a predictable livelihood, it perhaps offered them less opportunity for creativity
than the independent luxury artisans working beyond the reach of the palace and selling
their finery in the markets.
Some of these independent artisans, producing both luxury and utilitarian goods, were
concentrated in specific neighborhoods, or calpolli. Independent artisans could not
necessarily depend on the generosity of the state in obtaining raw materials for their
crafts. They relied on merchants and markets for access to raw materials and as outlets
for their finished products. The Tlatelolco feather workers maintained especially close
relations with their equally exclusive neighbors, the entrepreneurial pochteca
(professional merchants), who provided them with the shimmering tropical feathers
essential in their craft. While undocumented, it is likely that similarly close relations
existed between luxury artisans and merchants in other city-states.
Whether attached to elite palaces or living in exclusive neighborhoods, specialized
artisans required enduring and predictable links to several other areas of Aztec life: they
gained status through participation in society-wide ceremonies, served royal and other
noble palaces, dealt with long-distance merchants, and were consistent fixtures in any
major marketplace.

5.2: Why Water Bugs Practice Parental Care of Eggs
Although paternal care of young (fathers caring for their young) is common among fishes,
the trait is rare among other animals, vertebrates, and invertebrates alike. Among the few
paternal insects are giant water bugs. In Lethocerus water bugs, males guard and
moisten clutches of eggs (eggs deposited during a single episode of laying) that females
glue onto the stems of aquatic vegetation located above the waterline. Other kinds of
male water bugs (e.g., Abedus and Belostoma) permit their mates to lay eggs directly on
their backs, after which the male assumes responsibility for their welfare. A male Abedus
caring for its eggs spends hours perched near the water's surface, pumping his body up
and down to keep well-aerated water moving over the eggs. Clutches of Abedus eggs
that are experimentally separated from a male attendant do not develop, demonstrating
that male parental care is essential for offspring survival in this case.
Bob Smith has explored both the history and the adaptive value of these unusual paternal
behaviors. Since the closest relatives of the family that contains the paternal water bugs
are the Nepidae, a family of insects without male parental care, we can be confident that
the brooding species (species caring for eggs) evolved from nonpaternal ancestors.
Whether out-of-water brooding and back brooding evolved independently or whether one
preceded the other is not known, although some evidence suggests that back brooding
came later. In particular, female Lethocerus sometimes lay their eggs on the backs of
other individuals, male or female, when they cannot find suitable vegetation for that
purpose. This unusual behavior indicates how the transition from out-of-water brooding
to back brooding might have occurred. Females with the tendency to lay their eggs on the
backs of their mates could have reproduced in temporary ponds and pools where aquatic
vegetation sticking out of the water was scarce or absent.
But why do the eggs of water bugs require brooding? Huge numbers of aquatic insects
lay eggs that do perfectly well without a caretaker of either sex. However, Smith notes
that the eggs of giant water bugs are much larger than the standard aquatic insect egg,
with a correspondingly large requirement for oxygen, which is needed to sustain the high
metabolic rates underlying embryonic development. But the relatively low surface-tovolume ratio of a large aquatic egg leads to an oxygen deficit inside the egg. Since oxygen
diffuses through the air much more easily than through water, laying eggs out of water
can solve that problem. But this solution creates another problem, which is the risk of
drying out that the eggs face when they are high and dry. The solution, brooding by males
that moisten the eggs repeatedly, sets the stage for the evolutionary transition to back
brooding at the air-water interface.
Wouldn't things be simpler if water bugs providing parental care simply laid small eggs
with large surface-to-volume ratios? To explain why some water bugs produce eggs so
large that they need to be brooded, Smith points out that water bugs are among the
world's largest insects, almost certainly because they specialize in grasping and stabbing
large vertebrates, including fish, frogs, and tadpoles. Water bugs, like all other insects,
Page 25 of 269
grow in size only during the immature stages. After the final molt (loss of outer covering
layer) to adulthood, no additional growth occurs. As an immature insect loses its outer
covering as it grows from one stage to the next, it acquires a new flexible outer covering
that permits an expansion of size, but no immature insect grows more than 50 or 60
percent per molt. One way for an insect to grow large, therefore, would be to increase the
number of molts before making the final transition to adulthood. However, no giant water
bug molts more than six times. This observation suggests that these insects are locked
into a five-or six-molt sequence, just as the bird species, the spotted sandpiper, evidently
cannot lay more than four eggs per clutch. If a water bug is to grow large enough to kill a
frog in just five or six molts, then the immature insect that hatches from the egg must be
large because it will get to undergo only five or so 50-percent expansions.

6.1: Imitation in Monkeys and Apes
Almost all animals learn novel tasks more easily if they can observe a knowledgeable
demonstrator Biologist Tom Langen trained individual magpie jays to pry open a door on
a box that contained food. Subsequently, birds whose social groups included a
demonstrator learned how to open doors much more rapidly than birds whose groups did
not. Indeed, birds in groups that lacked a demonstrator did not even realize that there
was food in the boxes. Similarly, in captivity, many monkeys can learn to use rudimentary
tools to obtain food, and they do so more quickly and accurately in the presence of a
demonstrator. If monkeys learned as humans do, it would be safe to assume that the
monkeys learn to perform the tasks by watching the demonstrator and imitating his
actions. This would imply that the monkeys understand the demonstrator's intentions and
goals. But this does not seem to be the case.
Most animal species show very little evidence of purposeful copying by imitation. In the
laboratory, monkeys are attracted to tools and often begin experimenting with them after
observing another monkey do so, suggesting that social companions enhance and
facilitate tool use. But learning about a tool's use through "social facilitation" typically
requires extensive practice through trial and error. As a result, different individuals adopt
different idiosyncratic styles, and the spread of the skill is very slow. Although many
monkey species can learn to use tools in captivity, there are very few examples of tool
use in the wild. Capuchin monkeys, which inhabit Central and South America, are the
only monkeys that regularly use sticks or stones to pry into trees or break open nuts under
natural conditions. Capuchins also have comparatively large brains compared to other
monkeys. The relative lack of spontaneous tool use in monkey species suggests that
monkeys have difficulty recognizing the relation between actions and objects.
In the wild, baboon monkeys seem to use tools only in aggressive contexts. When
displaying, male baboons occasionally wave or throw sticks in the direction of their rivals.
Whether they recognize the potential function of these weapons, though, seems doubtful.
When one group of baboons in Namibia dislodged stones from a cliff when they were
disturbed by humans, they did so not only when people were under the cliff but also when
they were too far away to be struck. At Gombe, where chimpanzees compete with
baboons for food, chimpanzees throw branches at baboons. Baboons, however, never
throw objects at chimpanzees.
Chimpanzees and orangutans are different. In captivity, these animals, which are apes
rather than monkeys, attend closely to a demonstrator when learning to use tools to open
boxes, and they require very few trials to learn to copy his actions. They seem to
recognize the intentions and goals of the demonstrator, and they rapidly learn a tool's
function from attending to his behavior. Although they do not copy the demonstrator's
exact motor patterns as closely as children do, they do tend to conform to his technique.
Under natural conditions, chimpanzees and orangutans also use a variety of tools for
Page 27 of 269
different purposes. In fact, different populations of chimpanzees and orangutans use
different kinds of tools for different purposes, and the use of specific tool types appears
to be socially transmitted. Two points about tool use in chimpanzees and orangutans
seem relevant. First, in marked contrast to monkeys, no population of chimpanzees has
been reported not to use tools. Second, unlike monkeys, chimpanzees and orangutans
often show foresight and planning in selecting and modifying tools in advance of their use.
Before fishing for termites, chimpanzees often search some distance from the termite
mound to find an appropriate prodding stick and strip the bark from it. Similarly, when
preparing to crack open nuts, chimpanzees must carry both stones and nuts to suitable
hard surfaces. Often, this means that a chimpanzee will carry both nuts and stones over
considerable distances before beginning a nut-cracking session.
In their ability to plan, understand a tool's function, and appreciate a demonstrator's goals,
then, apes are strikingly different from most monkeys. This is not to say, however, that
tool use and manufacture are unique to apes or that monkeys are completely incapable
of imitation.

6.2: Roman and Chinese Metalworking
Chinese steel was highly valued in the Roman Empire (which controlled much of the
Western world between 27 B.C.E. and 476 A.D.) since Roman workshops could not
mass-produce metals with comparable strength and sharpness. Steel is a metal alloy
(mixture)manufactured by heating iron ore (raw iron) to high temperatures, then
combining the molten(melted) metal with carbon or other strengthening elements. The
quality of steel produced by these techniques depends on the sustained temperature of
the furnace and the quantity and condition of the added compounds. Good-quality steel
is harder than iron and has much greater flexibility and strength. Blades made from steel,
therefore, maintain a sharper edge for a longer time and have a greater resistance to rust
than their equivalent in iron. Western civilizations did not have sufficient knowledge of the
carbon compounds that needed to be added to molten iron to produce reliable steel.
Instead, the Romans produced wrought iron (iron with very low carbon content) by first
heating iron ore in a furnace (oven) to separate metal from impurities in a process known
as smelting. This technique was used throughout the Roman Empire to make tools and
bladed weapons. The resultant iron also acquired a trace of strengthening carbon from
the charcoal fueling the furnaces.
The situation was different in the Chinese Han Empire (206 B.C.E to 220 A.D.), where
metalworkers using more advanced furnaces had identified the natural compounds that
created better-quality iron during the smelting process. Through continual practice, they
refined the measurements needed to ensure that the compounds added to iron ore
introduced sufficient carbon to create a reliable quality of steel. The Chinese had
developed large enclosed furnaces that included bamboo nozzles (round openings) to
produce steady streams of air. This made it easier to keep the fire at a steady heat and
control reactions within the furnace. Chinese furnaces also burned compressed coal,
which further increased temperatures and reduced fuel costs. This was significant
because mass-produced cast iron (iron with carbon content greater than 2 percent) could
be transformed into steel by applying blasts of cool air that provided oxygen to the molten
metal (the "Hundred Refinings Method"). The Chinese also knew how to turn wrought iron
into steel. Blades were wrapped in fruit skins rich in carbon, containing a small amount of
impurities. These packages were then sealed in clay containers and heated at high
temperatures over a sustained period (up to twenty-four hours) until the metal absorbed
the necessary carbon and strengthening elements. In China, these techniques were used
to mass-manufacture a variety of tools, including knives, hammers, and cooking pots.
This important development allowed the Han regime to mass-manufacture high-quality
metal, including armor-piercing weapons. The Han understood that steel manufacturing
techniques provided Chinese troops with superior armor and weaponry. Consequently,
the regime tried to restrict the spread of this technology to foreign peoples and prevent
the export of Chinese steel supplies to neighboring nations. However, there were strong
incentives for Chinese merchants to break the embargoes (restrictions) and offer steel at
high prices to foreign traders. Smuggling became a problem, and the warlike Xiongnu
Page 29 of 269
people of Mongolia were able to capture Han metalworkers when they raided Chinese
territory. From these prisoners, the Xiongnu learned how to produce supplies of their own
steel weaponry, which they offered for exchange with other people. In this way, supplies
of superior eastern steel reached the Parthian Empire in Iran.
The superiority of this steel weaponry was demonstrated on the battlefield of Carrhae in
53 B.C.E. when a Roman army encountered Parthians from eastern Iran. The steel-tipped
arrows carried by the Parthians easily punched through Roman shields and armor. The
early Roman Empire possessed no weapons or armor comparable to that of the
Parthians. Consequently, Roman authorities did not fully understand the significance of
the metal used by their Iranian rivals. It was assumed that Parthian steel was the product
of unique iron ores that could only be found in the distant east, and no initiative was taken
to determine how these metals could be produced. This explanation seemed reasonable
when the Romans considered how geography and climate provided the distant East with
better fabrics, more precious stones, and more potent flavorings in the form of spices.

7.1: Early Chinese Silk Production
China is justly famous for its silk production, which probably began more than 6,000 years
ago. Excavations of Neolithic sites have revealed clay artifacts with impressions made
apparently by silk cloth, as well as stone ornaments carved in the shape of silkworms.
The earliest find of silk itself, dated to around 2800 B.C., is from Zhejiang province, where
a fragment of cloth was preserved in damp conditions inside a bamboo box. Zhejiang
province, in southeast China, has always been an important silk-producing area and was
probably also the center of one of the major prehistoric cultures.
Later writers attributed a well-organized system of production to the Western Zhou
dynasty (1050-771 B.C.). A text compiled or revised in the Han period (206 B.C.-A.D. 220)
describes a silk supervisor, a hemp supervisor, dyers, and weavers working in the
women's section of the palace. Although one silkworm, making its cocoon, spins a pair of
filaments that may be up to one kilometer in length, because of the fineness of these
filaments, thousands of silkworms are required to produce enough silk to weave a length
of cloth. From an early date in China, it was found best to carry out the manufacture of
silk cloth on a large scale, with a division of labor according to the various tasks: picking
the mulberry leaves to feed the silkworms, reeling the filaments from the cocoons,
weaving, etc. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, this highly organized and
subdivided industry fascinated Westerners, who collected sets of illustrations of the
different stages. Silk production has traditionally been associated with women in China,
and in imperial days the empress would perform an annual mulberry-leaf-picking
ceremony outside the Hall of Sericulture in Beijing.
By the Han dynasty, the silk industry was already highly specialized, producing in addition
to plain cloth, self-patterned monochrome cloth figured gauzes, and thicker, multicolored
cloth. The last was highly valued, costing up to fifteen times as much as plain silk. Chain
stitch embroidery also became widespread at this time and was used to decorate clothes,
wall hangings, pillows, and horse trappings. Elaborate examples have been found in Han
dynasty tombs in Hubei and Hunan provinces, where waterlogged land has preserved
much organic material.
Although produced in large quantities, silk remained an expensive luxury. Both woven silk
and raw silk were used as tribute to the emperor and as offerings to foreign tribes, such
as the Xiongnu on the northwestern borders of China. From here, Chinese silk must have
been traded along the Silk Route through Central Asia and the Middle East as far as
Europe. Most early examples of silk cloth in the West appear to have been woven locally
but from cultivated silk fiber of the Bombyx mori worm. The fact that China was the origin
of this fiber was acknowledged by the ancient Greeks and Romans, who referred to silk
as serica, literally, "Chinese. "By the end of the Han period, silk cultivation and knowledge
of silk processing must have begun to spread westward and by the fifth or sixth century,
had reached the Mediterranean area. But Western silk production throughout the Middle
Ages (fifth to fourteenth centuries A.D.) was never sufficient to satisfy demand from
Page 31 of 269
Europe and Mediterranean areas, and imported Chinese silk remained very important.
Trade along the Silk Route was at its most vigorous during China's Tang dynasty (A.D.
618-906), and travelers record the bazaars of the Middle East as being full of Chinese
patterned cloth and embroideries. Simultaneously, we are told that the Tang capital of
Chang'an was populated by large numbers of Iranian craftsmen. A silk weave now known
as weft-faced compound twill appears among Chinese textiles for a few centuries from
about A.D. 700. This may well have been a technique introduced by foreign weavers, as
it seems to have developed originally in Iran. In the West, it was particularly associated
with repeating designs of roundels(circles) enclosing paired or single animals, with flower
heads or rosettes between the roundels. The paired animals, rosettes, and the ring of
pearl-like dots that often made up the roundel frame all passed into Chinese design.
Indeed, trade in textiles or other items may have carried the motif of the pearl roundel to
China before any transfer of technology since it first appears in China as early as the fifth
century A.D. on stone carvings at Buddhist cave temples.

7.2: Murals, Frescoes, and Easel Paintings
Murals are pictures on walls or ceilings that become a part of the building's architectural
decoration. Archaeologists have excavated and saved mural paintings from Pompeii and
Herculaneum, cities that were buried by an eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 C.E.
Unfortunately, outdoor painting of any kind has little chance of surviving the effects of the
environment for very long Richard Haas's famous mural Homage to Cincinnatus, which
was painted in 1983 and is displayed on the Brotherhood Building in Cincinnati in the
United States, has faded considerably. Indoors, where walls can be kept dry, murals have
traditionally done much better when they were painted in fresco. The Italian word fresco
means "fresh." Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling, painted in the sixteenth century, is
a perfect example of fresco painting. In true fresco, water-based paints are applied to
fresh, wet plaster so that the pigment (color) soaks into the plaster. The paint actually
becomes part of the wall. The lime of the plaster, changing to calcium carbonate when it
dries, binds the pigments permanently in the wall. The colors are matte, not glossy. They
stay bright for hundreds of years, and as long as the wall lasts, the fresco lasts.
Paint applied to the wall when it is dry is not very permanent. Since some pigments will
not combine properly in fresco, they have to be applied by the artist. The blue pigment
that Giotto used in The Nativity, a fresco portraying the birth of Jesus Christ, would not
mix with the lime in plaster, so he had to paint it on the dry plaster. As a consequence,
the blue of the sky and the blue of Mary's robe have almost all flaked off. Since true fresco
must be painted on wet plaster, an artist can work on only a small portion of the wall where
the plaster was freshly applied beforehand. A normal area for a day's work might be about
one or two square yards, although the size depends on the complexity of the painting.
Some days, a fresco painter might complete only a head. In Giotto's fresco The Nativity,
the breaks between one day's work and the next are visible on close inspection.
Fresco painting takes a lot of preparation because artists have to have the entire
composition worked out before they get started on an individual patch of plaster. In
addition to the usual preliminary drawings, the fresco painter also makes cartoons on
paper in the same scale as the mural-so that the essential lines of the composition can
be traced and transferred to the wall.
Most artists produce easel paintings-painting that are painted on a portable wooden
support-that are intended to be hung on a wall. Bernardo Daddi painted the three-part
Madonna and Child (Jesus Christ and mother) for use during private prayer. Originally, it
may have rested on a table. After their prayers, the artwork owners could have folded the
sides together to store it or carry it to another location.
When Daddi and other European artists in the fourteenth century wanted to create an
easel painting, they usually worked on carefully prepared wooden panels. Wooden panels
assembled from several planks and as large as ten to twelve feet high were common in
that era. The wood had to be dried, aged, and sealed so that it would become an
Page 33 of 269
acceptable painting surface, as smooth as polished marble. Daddi mixed his pigments
with egg yolk, a medium that is called egg tempera. If the panel received decent treatment
over the years, a 650-year-old egg tempera such as Madonna and Child will have colors
that are still preserved and fresh. Egg tempera is quite a permanent medium.
Egg tempera paint dries as fast as egg yolk dries on a breakfast plate and is just as
stubborn to remove. An artist applies it in short strokes because of the rapid drying time,
and by the time the artist comes back to the panel with the next brushstroke, the preceding
one has already dried. Little blending is possible, and the only way to remove a mistake
is by scraping it off. Every stroke has to be meticulously placed with small brushes.

8.1: Recognizing Social Play in Animals
Many animals engage in some type of social play-that is, playing with others, including
chasing and fighting. Three functions of social play have been proposed: Social play may
(1) lead to the forging of long-lasting social bonds, (2) help develop much-needed physical
skills, such as those relating to fighting, hunting, and mating, and (3) aid in the
development of cognitive skills. One cognitively related benefit of the social play revolves
around the idea of self-assessment. Here, animals use social play as a means to monitor
their developmental progress as compared to others. For example, in infant sable
antelope (Hippotragus niger), individuals prefer same-age-play partners. While this
preference could be due to numerous factors, Kaci Thompson has hypothesized that it is
primarily a function of infants attempting to choose play partners that provide them with a
reasonable comparison from which to gauge their own development.
Since many of the behavior patterns seen during play are also common in other contextshunting, mating, dangerous aggressive contests-how do animals know they are playing
and not engaged in the real activity? And even more to the point, how do they
communicate this information to each other? Bekoff has proposed three possible
solutions to this important but often overlooked question. One way that animals may
distinguish play from related activities is that the order and frequency of behavioral
components of play are often quite different from that of the real activity. That is, when
play behavior is compared with the adult functional behavior that it resembles, behavioral
patterns during play are often exaggerated and misplaced. If young animals are able to
distinguish these exaggerations and misorderings of behavioral patterns by, for example,
observing adults that are not involved in playing, a relatively simple explanation exists for
how animals know they are playing.
A second, somewhat related, means by which animals may be able to distinguish play
from other activities is by the placement of play markers. These are also known as play
signals and can serve both to initiate play and indicate the desire to continue playing, and
to warn adults that the young are playing and not in danger of injury. In canids (the animal
group that includes dogs and wolves), for example, biting and shaking are usually
performed during dangerous activities such as fighting and predation. Yet, biting and
shaking are also play behaviors of young canids. Bekoff found that play markers such as
a bow (lowering the head) would precede biting and rapid side-to-side shaking of the head
to indicate that they were not dangerous behaviors. The bow would communicate that
this action should be viewed in a new context-that of play. Another play marker might be
a particular kind of vocalization-for example, chirping in a rat, whistling in a mongoose,
panting in a wolf, or a chimpanzee before or during a play interaction. Or there might be
a distinctive smell that indicated that the animals were engaged in play.
Play markers have also been found in primates such as the juvenile lowland gorilla.
Juvenile lowland gorillas play with each other often, and play ranges from what Elisabetta
Palagi and her colleagues call gentle play to rough play. Palagi's team discovered that
Page 35 of 269
when juvenile gorillas-particularly males-were involved with rough play, the play was often
preceded by a facial gesture they call the play face. This facial gesture, which is not seen
in other contexts, includes slightly lowered eyebrows and an open mouth. In addition to
using this facial gesture during rough play, juvenile gorillas also displayed it when a play
session was in a place that made escape (leaving) difficult -another context in which it
may be important to signal to others that what is about to occur is playing.
Yet another way by which young animals may be able to distinguish play from related
behaviors is by role reversal, or self-handicapping, on the part of any older playmates
they may have. In role reversal and self-handicapping, older individuals either allow
subordinate younger animals to act as if they are dominant during play or the older
animals perform some act (for example, an aggressive act) at a level clearly below that
of which they are capable. Either of these provides younger playmates with the
opportunity to recognize that they are involved in a play encounter.

8.2: Mesozoic Seed Dispersal
Many plants rely on wind to disperse (spread) their seeds. However, because seeds often
fall into the wrong places, wind dispersal seems wasteful; it can work only in plants that
produce great numbers of seeds. Wind-dispersed seeds must be light and small, so they
cannot carry much energy for seedling growth. They have to germinate (grow from seed)
in relatively well-lit areas, where they can obtain energy from sunlight. Alternatively, a
plant could have its seeds carried away by an animal and dropped into a good place for
growth. Many animals can carry larger seeds, which can successfully germinate in darker
places. Some animals visit plants to feed on pollen or nectar, and others eat parts of the
plants. Others simply walk by the plant, brushing it as they pass. Small seeds may be
picked up accidentally during such visits, especially if the seed has special hooks, burrs,
or glues to help attach it to a hairy or feathery visitor.
However, seed dispersal by animals is not cost-free. Many dispersers eat the seeds,
passing only a few undamaged through their internal organs. So there is a significant
wastage of seeds, depending on a delicate balance between the seed coat and the teeth
and stomach of the disperser. Too strong a seed coat, and the disperser will turn to easier
food, or germination will be too difficult; too weak a seed coat, and too many seeds will
be destroyed. Some plants' seeds germinate well only if they are eaten by a particular
disperser.
Scientists believe animals first began dispersing seeds sometime during the Mesozoic
era (252-65 million years ago). Seed dispersal by animals surely evolved after insect
pollination. Insects of the Jurassic period (206-145 million years ago) may have become
good pollinators, but they were too small to have been large-scale seed transporters.
Jurassic reptiles (including dinosaurs) were large enough, but often had low foodprocessing rates, so any seeds they swallowed were exposed to digestive juices for a
long time. Reptiles do not even have fur in which seeds can be entangled (though
feathered therapod dinosaurs might have). Seeds were undoubtedly dispersed by
dinosaurs to some extent since the huge vegetarian dinosaurs ate great quantities of
vegetation. But in spite of the size of the deposits of fertilizer (in the form of waste) that
must have surrounded seeds passing through dinosaurs, browsing dinosaurs (ones that
eat grass, leaves, and shrubs) probably damaged and trampled plants more than they
helped them. It is unlikely that any Mesozoic plant would have encouraged dinosaur
browsing.
Transport over a long distance can take a seed beyond the range of its normal predators
and diseases and can allow a plant to become very widespread, provided that there are
pollinators in its new habitat. As flowering plants adapted to seed dispersal by animals,
they probably dispersed into new habitats much faster than other plants did. Other things
being equal, we might expect a dramatic increase in the number of flowering plants found
in the fossil record as they adapted toward seed dispersal by animals rather than by wind.
Page 37 of 269
There were few effective animal seed transporters in the Jurassic period, and dinosaurs
are unlikely candidates in the Cretaceous period (the last period of the Mesozoic era).
The biologist Philip Regal suggested that birds and mammals prompted the distribution
of flowering plants by aiding them in seed dispersal. Birds and mammals have feathers
and fur in which seeds easily become entangled; seeds pass quickly through their small
bodies with their high food-processing rates and are likely to be unharmed unless they
have been deliberately chewed. Flowering plant seeds would have been especially suited
to transport by vertebrate (back-boned) animals because of their extra protective coating.
In contrast, the seeds of conifers (plants with needle-like leaves) are usually small and
light, designed to blow in the wind, and conifers depend on close clusters for pollination.
Isolated conifers are likely to be unsuccessful reproducers, and additional transport would
make little difference to their long-term success. However, many new types of flowering
plants appeared in the Early and Middle Cretaceous periods when mammals and birds
were still minor members of the ecosystem. So, many scientists are unconvinced by this
explanation of flowering plants' early success.

9.1: Challenges of Mesopotamian Agriculture
One of the world's first civilizations began in the area between the Tigris and Euphrates
Rivers known as Mesopotamia (modern Iraq), where much of the fertile land was under
cultivation by 4500 B.C. Sumer, in southern Mesopotamia, was dominated by eight major
cities, including the city of Uruk, which had 50,000 inhabitants by 3000 B.C. But the
irrigation that nourished Mesopotamian fields carried a hidden risk. Groundwater in
semiarid regions usually contains a lot of dissolved salt. Where the water table is near the
ground surface, as it is in river valleys and deltas, groundwater is moved up into the soil,
where it evaporates, leaving the salt behind in the ground. When evaporation rates are
high, sustained irrigation can generate enough salt to eventually poison crops. While
irrigation dramatically increases agricultural output, turning sunbaked floodplains into lush
fields can sacrifice long-term crop yields for short-term harvests.
Preventing the buildup of salt in semiarid soils requires either irrigating in moderation or
periodically leaving fields fallow (unplanted). In Mesopotamia, centuries of high
productivity from irrigated land led to increased population density, which fueled the
demand for more intensive irrigation. Eventually, enough salt crystallized in the soil that
further increases in agricultural production was not enough to feed the growing
population.
The key problem for Sumerian agriculture was that the timing of river runoff did not
coincide with the growing season for crops. Flow in the Tigris and Euphrates peaked in
the spring when the rivers filled with snowmelt from the mountains to the north. Discharge
was lowest in the late summer and early fall when new crops needed water and the most
intensive agriculture required storing water through soaring summer temperatures. A lot
of the water applied to the fields simply evaporated, pushing that much more salt into the
soil.
Salinization was not the only hazard facing early agricultural societies. Keeping the
irrigation ditches from becoming blocked by silt (mud) was a chief concern, as extensive
erosion from upland farming in the Armenian hills poured dirt into the Tigris and Euphrates
Rivers. Conquered people were put to work pulling mud from the all-important ditches.
Sacked and rebuilt repeatedly, Babylon was finally abandoned only when its fields
became too difficult to water. Thousands of years later, piles of silt more than thirty feet
high still line ancient irrigation ditches. On average, silt pouring out of the rivers into the
Persian Gulf has created over a hundred feet of new land a year since Sumerian time.
The ruins of the city of Uruk, a once thriving seaport, now stand a hundred and fifty miles
inland.
As Sumer prospered, fields lay fallow for shorter periods because of the growing demand
for food. By one estimate, almost two-thirds of the thirty-five thousand square miles of
arable land (land suitable for farming) in Mesopotamia were irrigated when the population
peaked at around twenty million. The combination of a high load of dissolved salt in
Page 39 of 269
irrigation water, high temperatures during the irrigation season, and increasingly intensive
cultivation pumped ever more salt into the soil.
Temple records from the Sumerian city-states inadvertently recorded agricultural
deterioration as salt gradually poisoned the ground. Wheat, one of the major Sumerian
crops, is quite sensitive to the concentration of salt in the soil. The earliest harvest
records, dating from about 3000 B.C., report equal amounts of wheat and barley in the
region over time; the proportion of wheat recorded in Sumerian harvests fell, and the
proportion of barley rose. Around 2500 B.C., wheat accounted for less than a fifth of the
harvest. After another five hundred years, wheat no longer grew in southern
Mesopotamia.
Wheat production ended not long after all the region's arable land came under production.
Previously, Sumerians irrigated new land to offset shrinking harvests from salty fields.
Once there was no new land to cultivate, Sumerian crop yields fell precipitously because
increasing salinization meant that each year fewer crops could be grown on the shrinking
amount of land that remained in production. By 2000 B.C., crop yields were down by half.
Clay tablets tell of the Earth turning white in places where the rising layer of salt reached
the surface.

9.2: Extinction Trends
In general, the diversity of life on Earth has been constant or increasing slightly over the
past 200 million or 300 million years. The geologic record shows new species emerging
and old ones dying away, resulting in a broad range of forms over geologic time. On closer
inspection, the geologic record also shows distinct short-term increases in the rate of
extinction termed extinction events. One such event occurred 65 million years ago and
marked the end of the Mesozoic Era, the age of reptiles. For years, the cause of this event
puzzled scientists. However, in the 1980s, a thin layer of unique sediment containing the
element iridium was discovered in sedimentary bedrock whose age coincided with this
event. Research showed that this sediment was created by an explosion on Earth's
surface, probably caused by an asteroid impact. The explosion threw a huge mass of
debris into the atmosphere, which, scientists reason reduced incoming solar radiation and
cooled Earth. Plants declined and the food sources for many herbivores (plant-eating
animals) apparently disappeared, followed, shortly thereafter, by a sequence of
extinctions among predators.
Many other extinction events are also identifiable in the geologic record. Some occur at
26-million-year intervals, and scientists speculate that they may be associated with
extraterrestrial impacts similar to the one at the end of the Mesozoic Era. Between these
events, many smaller episodes of extinction are also apparent. The influence of humans
on extinction patterns, however, does not appear until about 10.000 to 15.000 years ago.
The last glaciation on Earth reached its maximum 15,000 to 20.000 years ago. At this
time, the northern half of North America was covered with great sheets of glacial ice. A
similarly large mass of ice covered a large part of northern Eurasia. Humans lived in the
zone south of the ice border, where they survived by hunting and gathering. Among the
animals hunted were large mammals such as mammoths and mastodons, which are now
extinct. The extinction process appears to have taken place over several thousand years
in the presence of humans as the ice sheets were melting and the bioclimatic environment
was undergoing change. By 8,000 to 10,000 years ago, dozens of mammal species had
disappeared. Scientists debate whether the extinctions were driven mainly by changing
climate or mainly by human exploitation. No doubt these animals were under stress from
a changing environment, but the evidence for population reduction by early hunters is
also compelling. On balance, it appears certain that humans had a hand in the process.
At the very least, hunting hastened the extinction process.
The next wave of extinction began about 10,000 years ago with the spread of agriculture
and the growth of human populations. Before A.D. 1500 or so, much of the area taken up
by sedentary agriculture in Europe and Asia was in subtropical and midlatitude
environments. Many species were undoubtedly eliminated in these environments, but for
most, there is little or no record of their existence, especially for plants, insects, and
smaller organisms. In the Mediterranean basin, on the other hand, where the early
historical record is most complete, there is sound evidence of widespread mammal
Page 41 of 269
extinction associated with the spread of early agriculture. Though less widely cultivated
than the subtropics, the wet tropics were not exempt from early agriculture. Large areas
of monsoon forest and rainforest were destroyed in Asia and Africa by both crop farmers
and herders. In the Americas, tropical rainforests and wetlands were also lost to
agriculture. Recent evidence indicates that considerable areas of rainforest were cleared
by the Aztec and Mayan civilizations in Central America. All told, the first several thousand
years of agriculture undoubtedly forced the extinction of thousands of organisms, most of
which we can never know about because they left no measurable record of their
existence.
After A.D. 1500 and European colonization of the Americas and Africa, the rate of global
extinction increased again. In North America, most of the mid-latitude forests were
eradicated. In the tropics, plantation agriculture, mining, and expanding subsistence
farming (farming provides for the basic needs of the farmer) further reduced the tropical
rainforest. Before the twentieth century, however, forest eradication was relatively minor
by today's standards; beginning around 1950, rainforest destruction became a crisis that,
by 1975, had reached epidemic proportions.

10.1: Chemical and Biological Weathering of Rocks
Rocks can be broken into smaller pieces by a natural process known as weathering.
Weathering refers to the chemical alteration and physical disintegration of rocks by the
actions of air, water, and organisms. Two principal types of weathering are chemical
weathering and biological weathering.
The minerals that rocks are made of are subject to alteration by chemical weathering.
Some minerals, such as quartz, resist this alteration quite successfully, but others, such
as the calcium carbonate of limestone, dissolve easily. In any rock made up of a
combination of minerals, the chemical breakdown of one set of mineral grains leads to
the disintegration of the whole mass. In granite (made chiefly of the minerals quartz and
feldspar), the quartz resists chemical decay much more effectively than does the feldspar,
which is chemically more reactive and weathers to become clay. Often, granite surfaces
are heavily pitted (marked with many small holes or depressions). In such cases, the
feldspar grains are likely to have been weathered to clay and blown or washed away. The
quartz grains still remain, but they may eventually be loosened too. So even rock as hard
as granite cannot withstand the weathering process forever.
Three kinds of mineral alteration dominate in chemical weathering: hydrolysis, oxidation,
and carbonation. When minerals are moistened, hydrolysis occurs, producing only a
chemical alteration but an expansion in volume as well. This expansion can contribute to
the breakdown of rocks. Hydrolysis, it should be noted, is not simply a matter of
moistening; it is a true chemical alteration, and minerals are transformed into other
mineral compounds in the process. For example, feldspar hydrolysis yields a clay mineral
(silica) solution (that is, dissolved in water) and a carbonate or bicarbonate of potassium,
sodium, or calcium in solution. The new minerals tend to be softer and weaker than their
predecessors. In granite boulders, hydrolysis combines with other processes to cause the
outer shells to flake off.
When minerals in rocks react with oxygen in the air, the chemical process is known as
oxidation. We have plenty of evidence of this process in the reddish color of soils in many
parts of the world and in the reddish-brown hue of layers exposed in such places as the
Grand Canyon. The products of oxidation are compounds of iron and aluminum, which
account for the reddish colors seen in so many rocks and soils. In tropical areas, oxidation
is the dominant chemical-weathering process.
Various circumstances may convert water into a mild acid solution, thereby increasing its
effectiveness as a weathering agent. With a small amount of carbon dioxide, for instance,
water forms carbonic acid, which in turn, reacts with carbonate minerals such as
limestone and dolomite (a harder relative of limestone). This form of chemical weathering,
carbonation, is especially vigorous in humid areas, where limestone and dolomite
formations are often deeply pitted and grooved, and where the evidence of solution and
decay is prominent. This process even attacks limestone underground, contributing to the
Page 43 of 269
formation of caves and subterranean corridors. In arid areas, however, limestone and
dolomite resist weathering much better, although they may show some evidence of
carbonation at the surface.
Biological weathering is the breakdown of rock caused by the actions of living organisms.
This kind of weathering plays an important role in the formation of soils. It is through the
breakdown of rocks and the accumulation of a layer of minerals that plants can growplants whose roots and other parts, in turn, contribute to the weathering processes. But it
is likely that the role of plant roots in weathering is somewhat overestimated. The roots
follow paths of least resistance and adapt to every small irregularity in the rock. Roots
certainly keep cracks open once they have been formed. More importantly, however, are
as of roots tend to collect decaying organic material that is involved in chemicalweathering processes.
One of the most important aspects of biological weathering is the mixing of soil by
burrowing animals and worms. Another interesting aspect is the action of lichens, a
combination of algae and fungi that live on bare rock. Lichens draw minerals from the
rock through an absorption process. The swelling and contraction of lichens as they
alternately get wet and dry, may also cause small particles of rock to fall off.

10.2: The Professionalization of Painting in Europe
Before the eleventh century, most painters in Europe were monks (members of a religious
group that lived in seclusion), and their work was exclusively religious. Such artists
worked in a variety of art forms, including metalwork and manuscript illumination (the art
of illustrating handwritten books), and they did not sign their work, as art was considered
an opportunity for religious meditation, not self-advancement. Between the eleventh and
the fourteenth centuries, however, painting began being practiced by lay professionals
who had no connection to religious institutions. Inevitably, this had consequences both
for working practices and for the art that was produced. These new painters followed a
trade like any other. Like the woodworker, the potter, the baker, and the weaver, the lay
painter offered his technical proficiency for a fee. He was by no means above asking the
baker for the use of his ovens to make charcoal, employed as a black pigment. Nor would
the artist sneer at the cook, with whom he had many skills in common.
One of the consequences of this transition from monk to artisan was increasing
specialization. Painters were painters, not to be confused with illuminators, dyers, or
workers in wood and metal. Such distinctions were rigidly enforced by the guilds-powerful
associations of workers within specific trades-that developed to safeguard the
employment of tradespeople against competition and economic uncertainty, so that it
would have been unthinkable for a painter to be called in to illuminate a book page. There
were even fine distinctions drawn among painters. In fifteenth-century Spain, one could
find specialists in altarpiece painting (the painting of images for placement behind the
altar of a church), fabric painting, and interior decorating. Associated with these divisions
was a hierarchy of trades in which status tended to reflect the value of the materials.
Goldsmiths were the most prestigious and powerful artisans, painters more humble, and
woodworkers still more so. Guild restrictions prohibited the use of the most valuable
pigments (coloring substances), such as ultramarine, for lowly purposes such as the
painting of playing cards, carts, or parrot perches. Thus, these valuable pigments played
a role in establishing the social standing of painters: it was in their interest to use fine
materials.
Yet the art of painting was still regarded as a mechanical process. There was good and
bad, to be sure, but the task of the painter was to meet the specifications of a contract,
not to give free expression to artistic inspiration. It was the employer-the patron-who made
the decisions. Initially, the patrons of lay painters, when not church-affiliated, tended to be
royal or aristocratic, and the painter could find himself affiliated with a court. But as a
prosperous middle class emerged during the fourteenth and later centuries, the base of
patronage broadened, and artists could find commissions (orders for artworks)among
merchants.
Membership in a guild was attained by apprenticeship. Aspiring painters would serve a
training period of typically between four and eight years in a workshop operated by a
master craftsman, beginning as all apprentices do with the most menial of jobs, such as
Page 45 of 269
grinding pigments and making glue. Pigment grinding was a particularly arduous and
time-consuming job, and painters might need to allow several days for this alone in their
scheduling for a commission. To qualify as a "master painter" ready to accept contracts,
an apprentice would present a "master piece" to the guild for approval. Strange, then, that
this term has come to refer to an artist's most accomplished piece of work rather than his
or her first attempt to gain recognition.
A workshop undertook a commission as a group, much as a band of builders would (and
still does) perform a job collectively. The master was responsible for the overall execution
of the work, but the application of paint to the surface was as much, if not more, the
responsibility of his apprentices. Thus the signatures that appear on fourteenth-and
fifteenth-century art are simply trade stamps, denoting the name of the workshop's
master. This traditional training placed little value on personal talent or inspiration: a
person became a painter simply through hard work, dedication, and adherence to the
master's demands. Skill was the product of diligence.

11.1: The Economics of Academic Tenure
In some countries, many universities use an employment system for teachers known as
tenure. After a lengthy trial period, a faculty member whose performance meets with the
approval of the senior members of the department and the administration of the institution
may be awarded tenure. A tenured faculty member enjoys considerable job security for
the rest of his or her working life and can only be fired for reasons of "moral turpitude"
(bad or evil behavior) or "gross incompetence" or if the financial stability of the institution
requires the elimination of an entire department or program.
The high degree of job security enjoyed by tenured faculty members has been the source
of complaints about the tenure system. One issue that has been raised by many, including
legislators evaluating the finances and managerial practices of state universities in the
United States, is that tenure shelters faculty from accountability for poor performance.
Another argument is that tenure makes the university inefficient in responding to changing
instructional demands. It is difficult to substitute computer engineering faculty for civil
engineering faculty if most of the latter have tenure. In 1988, the Education Reform Act
significantly softened the tenure system in the United Kingdom, making it easier to fire
individual faculty members for financial reasons. More recently, some universities in the
United States have taken steps to give university administrators more control over
tenured professors, and, in general, American institutions of higher learning have ended
up increasing the use of part-time and nontenured instructors over time. In 1992, just 48
percent of all instructors who had tenure, were in a position that was expected to lead to
tenure.
The traditional argument in favor of tenure is based on academic freedom, the freedom
to investigate and teach any area of knowledge without restriction or interference. In this
view, tenure protects faculty members from retaliation for voicing unpopular views. For
example, a labor economist might not present a complete examination of the costs and
benefits of worker unions. He or she feared that a rabidly anti-union university leader
might seek to have the economist fired for speaking of the positive aspects of unions. In
fact, the American Association of University Professors (AAUP), a group dedicated to
protecting academic freedom, got its start in the wake of a 1901 decision by Stanford
University to fire economics instructor Edward Ross at the insistence of the university's
co-founder, Jane Stanford, who objected to his views on economics and other matters.
Going beyond academic freedom, the economics literature has recently turned to an
emphasis on tenure as a labor-market institution that may have a positive payoff to
universities through the incentives (motivation) it provides. For example, economist Lorne
Carmichael's model of an academic department treats tenure as the means of providing
incentives for incumbent (current) faculty to participate in identifying the best candidates
for new positions. If incumbent faculty had to worry that more-able new additions to the
department might replace them one day, they would be less inclined to make hiring
decisions that were in the best interests of the university. Incumbents are much better
Page 47 of 269
positioned to judge the talents of potential new hires than the university administration.
Moreover, the long-term job security they gain through tenure gives incumbents an
incentive to hire new faculty who might be more productive than the existing faculty in a
department.
The economists Michael McPherson and Morton Shapiro have also emphasized the
notion that tenure has a positive payoff for the university by aligning the self-interest of
individual faculty members with the long-run interests of the institution. They see two
valuable economic benefits from the tenure system beyond the incentive to hire and
mentor more productive new faculty. First, job security allows tenured faculty the
independence to perform credibly objective evaluations of students and other faculty.
People outside the university who rely on the information provided by student grades or
faculty reviews of papers or proposals can have greater confidence that these evaluations
have not been colored by the faculty member's concern about job security. Second,
tenure allows faculty to make long-run strategic decisions about educational policy and
research, even if these are in conflict with the short-run career interests of administrators.
The fact that tenured faculty often are viewed as obstacles to change by ambitious
administrators looking to enhance their records for their next career move might well be
a good thing for the long-run interests of the university.

11.2: Programming Computers to Play Games
Backgammon is the oldest board game in the world. It was first played in ancient
Mesopotamia, starting around 3000 B.C. The rules of Backgammon were codified in the
seventeenth century, and the game has changed little since. The same can't be said about
the players of the game. One of the best backgammon players in the world is now a
software program. In the early 1990s, Gerald Tesauro, a computer programmer at IBM,
began developing a new kind of artificial intelligence (Al). At the time, most Al programs
relied on the brute computational power of microchips. This was the approach used by
Deep Blue, the powerful set of IBM mainframes that managed to defeat chess
grandmaster Garry Kasparov in 1997. Deep Blue was capable of analyzing more than
two hundred million possible chess moves per second, allowing it to consistently select
the optimal chess strategy. (Kasparov's brain, on the other hand, evaluated only about
five moves per second.) But all this strategic firepower consumed a lot of energy, while
playing chess. Deep Blue was a fire hazard and required specialized heat-dissipating
equipment so that it didn't burst into flames. Kasparov, meanwhile, barely broke a sweat.
That's because the human brain is a model of efficiency: even when it's deep in thought,
the cortex consumes less energy than a lightbulb.
While the popular press was celebrating Deep Blue's stunning achievement-a machine
had outwitted the greatest chess player in the world!-Tesauro was puzzled by its
limitations. Here was a machine capable of thinking millions of times faster than its human
opponent, and yet it had barely won the match. Tesauro realized that the problem with all
conventional Al programs, even brilliant ones like Deep Blue's, was their rigidity. Most of
Deep Blue's intelligence was derived from other chess grandmasters, whose wisdom was
painstakingly programmed into the machine. (IBM programmers also studied Kasparov's
previous chess matches and engineered the software to exploit his recurring strategic
mistakes.) But the machine itself was incapable of learning. Instead, it made decisions by
predicting the probable outcomes of several million different chess moves. The move with
the highest predicted value was what the computer ended up executing. For Deep Blue,
the game of chess was just an endless series of math problems.
Of course, this sort of artificial intelligence isn't an accurate model of human cognition.
Kasparov managed to compete on the same level as Deep Blue even though his mind
had far less computational power. Tesauro's surprising insight was that Kasparov's
neurons were effective because they had trained themselves. They had been refined by
decades of experience to detect subtle spatial patterns on the chessboard. Unlike Deep
Blue, which analyzed every possible move, Kasparov was able to instantly isolate his best
options and focus his mental energies on evaluating only the most useful strategic
alternatives.
Tesauro set out to create an Al program that acted like Garry Kasparov. He chose
Backgammon as his model and named the program TD-Gammon. (The TD stands for
temporal difference.) Deep Blue had been preprogrammed with chess acumen, but
Page 49 of 269
Tesauro's software began with absolutely zero knowledge. At first, its backgammon
moves were entirely random. It lost every match and made stupid mistakes. But the
computer didn't remain a novice for long; TD-Gammon was designed to learn from its
own experience. Day and night, the software played Backgammon against itself, patiently
learning which moves were most effective. After a few hundred thousand games of
Backgammon, TD-Gammon was able to defeat the best human players in the world.
How did the machine turn itself into an expert? Although the mathematical details of
Tesauro's software are numbingly complex, the basic approach is simple. TD-Gammon
generates a set of predictions about how the backgammon game will unfold. Unlike Deep
Blue, the computer program doesn't investigate every possible permutation. Instead, it
acts like Garry Kasparov and generates its predictions from its previous experiences. The
software compares these predictions to what actually happens during the backgammon
game. The ensuing discrepancies provide the substance of its education, and the
software strives to continually decrease this error signal. As a result, its predictions
constantly increase in accuracy, which means that its strategic decisions get more and
more effective and intelligent.

12.1: Chondrites
Meteorites are the keys to understanding how Earth and the solar system formed
because, although superficially, many meteorites do not look significantly different from
most Earth rocks, close study shows that they are very different, with those differences
holding clues to their distant origin. The most common type of meteorite-known
collectively as the "chondrites,” contains clues about the kinds of material that went into
the construction of our planet.
The chondrites are just one of a variety of meteorite types, all ancient, but each with a
different history-and, each containing clues about how Earth and other planets formed
and evolved. For example, the members of one group, the iron meteorites, are made up
of solid iron metal, alloyed (or mixed) with a modest amount of nickel. All the evidence
indicates that these meteorites are similar to the metallic cores that inhabit the interiors
of planets.
In contrast to the iron meteorites, the chondrites are made up of a jumble of mineral
grains, many of them familiar constituents of rocks on Earth, but also including pure iron
metal-which does not occur in rocks on Earth-and small marble-like spherical objects
called "chondrules" (it is from these that the chondrites take their name). The chaotic
texture of chondrites indicates that they were formed in a process that randomly swept
together their different components and cemented them together. The texture is also an
instant clue to one of their most important characteristics: they have never been melted.
Furthermore, mineral grains in the chondrites have provided the oldest ages ever
measured by radiometric dating; they date from the very earliest days of the solar system.
These two properties have led the geochemists who work on these intriguing objects to
conclude that chondrites bring us something we cannot find on Earth or among other
meteorite varieties: an unprocessed sample of the original material from which Earth and
our neighboring planets were made. They appear to be unaltered samples of the solid
matter that was floating around in the solar system just as Earth was being born; there is
strong evidence that they come from small asteroids that never grew big enough to heat
up and melt, as larger objects did.
The primitive nature of the chondrites has made them very important for information about
Earth’s overall chemical composition. You might wonder why these rare rocks from space
should play such a key role when the whole Earth Is right below our feet, ready for us to
analyze. The answer, in brief, is that if we want to understand how Earth got to its present
state, we have to know something about its initial, overall composition. But we only have
access to rocks from our planet’s thin outermost skin-which is very different from the
inaccessible interior. However, by using information from the chondrites as a reference
point and integrating that data with direct measurements on surface rocks and information
about the interior obtained using remote sensing methods, geochemists have been able
to work out models for Earth’s overall composition that satisfy already obtained
independent evidence such as the density of our planet.
Page 51 of 269
An important concept in formulating these models is that the composition of Earth and the
other "terrestrial planets” (the solar system inner, rocky planets, Mercury, Venus, and
Mars) depends on the proportions of the main minerals found in the chondrites that each
planet incorporated. A good example is iron, which is so abundant and so heavy that the
well-known density variations among the terrestrial planets can almost entirely be
attributed to differences in their iron contents. Grains of iron metal are abundant in the
chondrites, but different chondrites contain different amounts. The reason Earth is much
denser than Mars, according to the models, is that its chondrite-like building blocks
happened to contain more iron. Similarly, other differences among the terrestrial planets
can be understood in terms of different planets incorporating different amounts of the
various constituents of chondrites. This is undoubtedly an overly simplistic description of
what actually happened, but that does not invalidate the chondrites as a good starting
point for understanding the composition of Earth and other planets.

12. 2: Greek Art in the Classical Age
Greek art is thought to have reached its peak during the Classical period in the fifth
century B.C.E. Leading up to this period, the most common type of sculpture was the
kouroi, which were life-size or larger marble statues of nude males that stood on sacred
sites, often as grave markers but also as offerings to the gods. With very stiff, straight
poses (they evidently were modeled after Egyptian statues), it is clear that kouroi were
not intended to look like real people. However, by the early fifth century, the style of Greek
artwork changed. The transition is usually symbolized by the Kritios Boy, a marble statue
found in the center of ancient Athens and attributed to Kritios, a sculptor active in Athens
around 490-460 B.C.E. It is dated by experts to just before 480 B.C.E. and represents
Callias, a victor in the boys' footrace in athletic competition. The changes from the
traditional kouros are slight, but the boy is standing as a boy might actually stand, the
right leg forward of the left, which bears the weight of the body so that the right can relax
slightly, not how artistic convention decrees a hero should pose. Yet this naturalness is
achieved without the loss of an idealization (representation as perfect) of the human body.
Here is, in the words of the art historian Kenneth Clark "the first beautiful nude in art. " As
John Boardman, an authority on Greek art, puts it: "This is a vital novelty in the history of
ancient art-life deliberately observed, understood, and copied. After this, all becomes
possible."
There are a few clues as to why this revolution in art, from the stylized to the observed,
took place. One is that bronze was becoming the most popular medium in which statues
were being created, (It has been suggested that the Kritios Boy is a copy of a bronze
original now lost.) The technical problems involved in casting and assembling bronze
statues had been solved by the end of the sixth century B.C.E., as the earliest examples
show. From the Classical period on, bronze predominated in Greek sculpture, but as
almost every statue was later melted down so its metals could be reused, it is hard to
guess this today. The few bronzes to survive (the Riace warriors, the Delphi charioteer,
and the majestic Zeus found in a shipwreck off Cape Artemisium foremost among them)
simply highlight what has been lost in quantity and quality. Bronze allows far greater
flexibility. Modeling the process of building up a figure in bronze is totally different from
cutting into marble. As a wonderful exhibition at the Royal Academy in London in 2012,
Bronze, also showed, bronze can be burnished (smoothed and shined) to produce a wide
variety of aesthetic effects that pure white marble lacks.
The revolution also suggests a preoccupation with the human form. While earlier Greek
artists were focused on those few human beings who had become heroes, they now
seemed concerned with the physical beauty of human beings as an end in itself. It is hard
to see the Riace warriors without being aware of their intense sensuality. Yet within a few
years, this sensuality fades and is replaced by a greater concentration on the nature of
the human body as an ideal. It was the sculptor Polycleitos, probably a native of Argos
working from the fifth into the fourth century B.C.E., who allied aesthetics with
mathematics when he suggested that the perfect human body was perfect precisely
Page 53 of 269
because it reflected ideal mathematical proportions that were capable of being
discovered. One of his statues, the Doryphoros, or "spear bearer" (originally in bronze,
but now known only through Roman copies in marble), was supposed to represent this
ideal. If this approach was followed to its extreme, all statues would have had the same,
perfect proportions, but the Greeks could not close their eyes to the variety of human
experience. There always remained a tension in the art of the period between the abstract
ideal of the human body and a particular body copied by the artist. This may be one
reason for its aesthetic appeal.

13.1: Trade and Herring in Dutch Society
Although the people of the Netherlands were at war with their Spanish rulers, the Dutch
economy prospered between 1588 and 1648, and trade was at the heart of this prosperity.
The expansion of trade, directly and indirectly, brought increased employment
opportunities: toward the middle of the seventeenth century, the fleet of trading ships
employed almost 30,000 people, and the handling of cargoes in the ports provided work
for large numbers of people. In addition, there were those involved in the internal transport
system, moving goods and people along the rivers and canals. Another important source
of employment was provided by artisan production of various kinds; manufacturing was
still labor-intensive-- literally handwork - with very limited inputs of nonanimal energy, with
the exception of the large-scale use of wind power for sawmills. Also, the fisheries and
secondary industries were important sources of employment. Although the import and reexport of goods through the staple market (the market for bulk commodities, especially
raw materials) were paramount to the success of the trading economy, manufacturing and
fisheries supplied valuable export products for foreign trade.
Herring are edible ocean fish, and the herring fishery was important as a source of
employment because it provided a crucial export item, as well as helping to feed the Dutch
population. In terms of the numbers of boats and people employed, most if not all of the
growth of the fishery seems to have already taken place before the revolt against Spanish
rule began in 1568, with subsequent developments consisting chiefly of improvements in
organization and coordination between the various branches of the industry. Dutch
success in the fisheries was by no means certain ahead of time; the movement of the
best herring fishing grounds to the North Sea gave them the opportunity, but they were
geographically no better placed to exploit this than many potential rivals, indeed less so
than the Scots and the English. What, then, accounts for the greater success of the
Dutch?
Over the course of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, northern Netherlands fishing
fleets introduced a number of key innovations, which gave them a decisive edge.
Specialized fishing boats came into use, and mother ships (supply ships) began to sail
with the fleet to enable these boats to stay on the fishing grounds longer. Also, a new
method of preserving herring was found in the fifteenth century, and curing began to take
place at sea to improve the quality of the product. The high quality was indeed the key to
the success of the Dutch herring business, and concern to maintain this advantage over
their competitors led to the use of the finest salt that could be found and to careful
monitoring of the barreling storage process. It seems to have been agreed by
contemporaries that Dutch herring was the best, which provided the Dutch with a market
even in Scandinavia with its own sources of fish. In fact, herring made a significant
contribution to the development of the Baltic trade providing an export item with a ready
market there.
Page 55 of 269
There may have been as many as 500 specialized boats employed at the peak of the
herring fishery in the early seventeenth century. This in itself must have provided
employment for 6,000 to 7,000 people, though only for part of the year, as the herring
fishing was seasonal, starting in late June and ending in December or early January.
However, if herring packers and the workers making the barrels in which the fish were
packed are included, then the work provided directly by the fishery rises considerably.
Moreover, the indirect boost to shipbuilding and sail and rope making is impossible to
calculate but must have been significant, and if the transport to various markets by barge
boat is taken into consideration, then the overall impact of the fishery on employment
opportunities rises again.
There were other sea fisheries, especially cod, but the biggest growth in the early
seventeenth century came in Arctic whaling, which rose from practically nothing to an
important if not always thriving, business. Initially, this was open sea whaling, but from
about the 1640s onward, certain whales became increasingly difficult to find in open
waters, which meant that whaling had to turn to the construction of specially strengthened
ships that could follow the whales into the pack ice. The real expansion of Dutch whaling,
however, belongs to the second half of the century.

13.2: Increasing Jellyfish Populations
Scientists have had a tough time trying to discover whether recent increases in jellyfish
populations are really worth worrying about. On one hand, jellyfish are known to
proliferate rapidly in response to positive changes in prey abundance or environmental
conditions such as water temperature and sunlight. The size of these "blooms" can vary
from year to year. On the other hand, these population explosions are occurring in many
places on a scale now widely viewed as unprecedented. In the Sea of Japan, for instance,
Nomura's jellyfish are known to have drifted in from the south in large numbers three
times during the twentieth century: in 1920, 1958, and 1995. Beginning in 2002, however,
they have turned up every summer but one, and in astonishingly high numbers. In 2005,
one of the worst years, up to 500 million Nomura's jellyfish were reported to be drifting
into the sea each day.
Several factors have now been identified as possible contributions to the increased
success of jellyfish worldwide. One of the leading suspects is the human exploitation of
fish and other marine resources, something that has intensified in recent decades partly
because of advances in large-scale seafood harvesting and processing techniques. Only
a handful of species are thought to prey directly on jellyfish, and most of these predatorsincluding giant sea turtles-are becoming increasingly rare. The main impact of overfishing,
though, may stem from the reduction of filter-feeding fish, such as sardines and
anchovies, which eat the same food as jellyfish. In the southern Atlantic waters off
Namibia, where overharvesting has resulted in the complete collapse of a once-thriving
sardine fishery, unusually large numbers of jellyfish are now a permanent feature of the
near-shore marine ecosystem.
At the same time, jellyfish seem to thrive under conditions that are becoming increasingly
widespread because of human-associated activities. Although the theory is highly
speculative and still under debate, global warming and acidification of the oceans as a
result of more carbon dioxide dissolving in the water may be two such factors. Jellyfish
love warm water, for one thing. And at least one study from the North Sea has reported
finding a connection between greater jellyfish abundance and higher acid levels.
Another environmental change, and one that is more firmly linked to expanding jellyfish
populations, is eutrophication, the process by which water becomes enriched with
dissolved nutrients, resulting in more aquatic plant life and, subsequently, reduced levels
of oxygen. Eutrophication occurs in near-shore ocean waters close to large human
population centers and the mouths of large rivers. A strong correlation exists between
blooms of algae and other plankton caused by excessive nutrients from sewage and
fertilizer runoff and jellyfish eruptions. One example is the waters off the southern United
States coast. Nutrient-enriched waters from the Mississippi River have created, in the
Gulf of Mexico, a massive dead zone (ocean area with low oxygen levels).
While fish and other aquatic life forms are finding survival increasingly challenging,
Page 57 of 269
jellyfish such as moon jellyfish and sea nettles are becoming increasingly numerous. This
is not really surprising. A checklist of jellyfish traits-good survival rates during periods of
starvation, rapid reproduction, diverse diet, ability to feed in murky water, and capacity for
surviving under low oxygen conditions typical of dead zones-reveals that these seemingly
fragile organisms are actually tough life forms, ideally suited to survive in disturbed
environments. According to the National Science Foundation, the main science-funding
agency in the United States, there are currently 400 known ocean dead zones where
almost nothing lives except jellyfish.
Finally, like many other marine invasive species, jellyfish have benefited from the
globalization of human trade. Many species are hardy enough to survive in the ballast
water of ships, and jellyfish polyps can attach themselves to their hulls. Because of this,
jellyfish species are being inadvertently introduced into new aquatic habitats. One of the
best examples involves the warty comb jelly (Mnemiopsis leidyi), a species that likely
made its way into the Black Sea for the first time in 1982. Since then, this highly adaptable
organism has been thriving; its original nonnative range has expanded to include not just
the Black Sea but also the Caspian, Baltic, and North Seas.

14.1: Northwest Coast Art
The Pacific Northwest of North America produced stable Native American cultures. This
was in great measure due to the abundance of resources and temperate climate, which
figured prominently in the social and cultural fabric of the people. Fishing, hunting, and
foraging produced ample means of sustenance, and therefore, the people of this region
had no reason to cultivate crops or domesticate animals. Their cultures tended to share
certain features, probably because they traded and warred with one another. Artistic
motifs (recurring artistic elements) were alike, and they shared a common religionshamanism (ancient belief systems centered on shamans, individuals who communicate
with invisible forces or spirits). Although their gods and myths differed, the Northwest
peoples all acknowledged the power of shamans to contact the spirits of the forest and
waters, to heal the sick, and to predict the future.
The rich forests of the area provided Native American artists with a wealth of materials
for sculpting. Huge spruce and cedar trees abounded for many centuries, and when steel
knives were obtained from fur traders and used as tools, Northwest-coast artists excelled
in producing magnificent totem poles, carved posts for wooden dwellings, masks, rattles,
and other objects. Carved wooden house posts not only supported the roof but also gave
additional decoration to the interior. When living closer to the sea, artists had access to
abalone shells that were used as inlays to give luster to their sculpted works.
Although many art objects from the area, such as masks, concern themselves with
shamanistic religious rituals, a fair amount of art was secular. Like some African art, it was
used to maintain the social fabric and bolster a ruler's power. For example, in the Tlingit
group-a people who lived in the islands and bays of the upper reaches of the Pacific
Northwest-communities were made up of a number of families, each of which had its own
chief who inherited his rank from his mother. Carefully devised social customs obliged
both men and women to marry outside their own clan. In this way, a balance was
established in which no one family achieved dominance. Nonetheless, chiefs competed
fiercely with each other in displays of riches. Totem poles formed a part of this ostentation,
proclaiming prestige and family pride through genealogy-much like the coats of arms of
the European aristocracy. Totem poles were carved from single tree trunks and often
reached a height of 90 feet (27.4 meters). Probably originating as funerary (burial)
monuments, by the nineteenth century, they had become fixtures adorning the exteriors
of chiefs' houses.
Eagles, beavers, and whales appear on the totem poles, in essence, as symbolic crests
that a chief inherited from his ancestors. The Tlingit did not worship these figures or have
any supernatural relationship with them. They are governed by traditional artistic
principles. One of these is that of bilateral symmetry-the designs on either side of the
central axis are identical. Another specifies the transition from one motif to another. Each
design must appear to grow from the one below. Thus, not only the overall vertical form
of the totem pole but also the design of its interior parts leads the eye upward along its
Page 59 of 269
central axis.
As historical documents that record the wealth, social position, and relative importance of
the person who paid for them, totem poles are quite similar to sculptural records from
other cultures. The ultimate function of such art was probably to act as a gift. As the
anthropologist Frederick J. Dockstader claimed, "The life goal of many ... involved the
belief that the greatest value was to give away all of one's possessions." The actual
working out of such a philosophy created some interesting scenarios. The more one gave
away, the greater one's prestige. In turn, one's rival was more or less obliged to give back
the same or more material wealth in order to prove greater disdain for possessions. As a
result, totems and other goods were often burned, thrown into the sea, or otherwise
destroyed.

14.2: Examining the Problem of Bycatch
A topic of increasing relevance to the conservation of marine life is bycatch-fish and other
animals that are unintentionally caught in the process of fishing for a targeted population
of fish. Bycatch is a common occurrence in longline fishing, which utilizes a long heavy
fishing line with baited hooks placed at intervals, and in trawling, which utilizes a fishing
net (trawl) that is dragged along the ocean floor or through the mid-ocean waters. Few
fisheries employ gear that can catch one species to the exclusion of all others. Dolphins,
whales, and turtles are frequently captured in nets set for tunas and billfishes, and
seabirds and turtles are caught in longline sets. Because bycatch often goes unreported,
it is difficult to accurately estimate its extent. Available data indicate that discarded
biomass (organic matter from living things) amounts to 25-30 percent of the official catch,
or about 30 million metric tons.
The bycatch problem is particularly acute when trawl nets with small mesh sizes (smallerthan-average holes in the net material) are dragged along the bottom of the ocean in
pursuit of groundfish or shrimp. Because of the small mesh size of the shrimp trawl nets,
most of the fishes captured are either juveniles (young), smaller than legal size limits, or
undesirable small species. Even larger mesh sizes do not prevent bycatch because once
the net begins to fill with fish or shrimp, small individuals caught subsequently are trapped
without ever encountering the mesh. In any case, these incidental captures are
unmarketable and are usually shoveled back over the side of the vessel, dead or dying.
The bycatch problem is complicated economically and ecologically. Bycatch is a liability
to shrimp fishers, clogging the nets and increasing fuel costs because of increased drag
(resistance) on the vessel. Sorting the catch requires time, leading to spoilage of
harvested shrimp and reduced time for fishing. Ecologically, high mortality rates among
juvenile fishes could contribute to population declines of recreational and commercial
species. Evidence of this effect exists for Gulf of Mexico red snapper and Atlantic Coast
weakfish. Because the near-shore areas where shrimp concentrate are also important
nursery grounds for many fish species, shrimp trawling could have a profound impact on
stock size.
Once the dead or dying bycatch is returned to the ecosystem, it is consumed by predators,
detritivores (organisms that eat dead plant and animal matter), and decomposers
(organisms that break down dead or decaying organic matter), which could have a
positive effect on sport fish, seabird, crab, and even shrimp populations. Available
evidence indicates that 40-60 percent of the 30 metric tons of catch discarded annually
by commercial fishing vessels, and even more of the non-catch waste (organisms killed
but never brought to the surface), does not lie unused on the bottom of the sea. It
becomes available to midwater and ocean-bottom scavengers, transferring material into
their food web and making energy available to foragers (organisms that search for food)
that are normally tied up in ocean-bottom, deep-ocean, midwater, and open-ocean
species.
Page 61 of 269
Overfishing and overdiscarding may thus contribute to a syndrome known as "fishing
down of food webs," whereby we eliminate apex (top) predators and large species while
transforming the ocean into a simplified system increasingly dominated by microbes,
jellyfish, ocean-bottom invertebrates, plankton, and planktivores. The strongest evidence
for the fishing down phenomenon exists in global catch statistics that show alarming shifts
in species composition from high-value, near-bottom species to lower-value, open-ocean
species. In the last three decades of the twentieth century, the global fishing fleet doubled
in size, and technology advanced immeasurably. Despite increased effort and technology,
total catch stabilized, but landing rates (rates at which species are caught) of the most
valuable species fell by 25 percent.
Conservation organizations have condemned the obvious and extreme waste associated
with bycatch. Public concern over the high mortality rates of endangered marine turtles
captured in shrimp trawls led to the development of turtle exclusion devices (TEDs) in the
1980s. TEDs were incorporated into the shrimp net design with the purpose of directing
turtles out of nets without unacceptably reducing shrimp catches. Marine engineers and
fishers also developed shrimp net designs that incorporate bycatch reduction devices
(BRDs), taking advantage of behavioral differences between shrimp and fish or between
different fishes in order to separate fishes.

15.1: Challenge of Dendrochronology
Dendrochronology is the technique of counting tree rings to determine a tree's age and
measuring the width of these rings to determine characteristics of past climates. This
might seem simple: each ring represents one year, and wider rings generally mean better
growing conditions-plentiful rainfall, moderate temperatures, and so forth. But the
seasonal growth of a particular tree is affected by factors other than the weather. Trees
vary, one from another, just like people do. The genetic makeup of each individual tree is
unique, so one particular tree may grow a bit more quickly than another. Highly local
conditions can also change over time. It is easy enough to see that if part of the soil near
a tree has been eroded, this will impact the tree's root system and limit its growth, at least
until the situation stabilizes. Then again, an infestation of insects may affect a tree in one
valley more than the same type of tree ten miles away, or one tree may suddenly start to
get a lot more sunlight when an old, big tree in the neighborhood finally falls. These kinds
of factors produce significant variations among individual specimens, and that fact means
that researchers need to average together samples from many specimens of a single tree
species in one region over the same time period. Some dendrochronologists think that
measuring an average of twenty-five to thirty tree-ring records in a locale is an essential
first step in getting around the problem of individual variability. While it may be easy
enough to find thirty samples in some locations for particular periods, it obviously
becomes less and less likely the more ancient the wood samples are.
Another issue is more general. Trees that are fortunate enough to live on good soil and
near local sources of groundwater often grow at steady rates. Such growth translates into
attractive trees that are tall and well-formed; they also have rings that are wide and quite
uniform in thickness, but their uniform growth rings make them entirely useless when it
comes to inferring anything about past weather patterns. That is why, instead of looking
at superb botanical specimens, dendrochronologists focus their work on wood from trees
that are living a tough life due to poor soil, steep slopes, the absence of local groundwater,
or some other challenge. It is these "tortured" trees that are the most likely to grow very
little during years of scarce rains or do poorly after a harsh winter and a late spring. What
this means, of course, is that few trees in the woods are likely to be good samples for the
scientist. Indeed, it may be quite a small fraction that yields useful ring patterns. Again,
this increases the challenge of finding enough good samples to say with much certainty
what past conditions were like.
Another factor of dendrochronology relates to the wood itself. In the spring, a tree grows
rapidly, creating new cells on the outside of its trunk and branches, just under the bark.
These cells, called "earlywood" or "springwood," are large and have thin cell walls; both
these factors contribute to making the wood relatively lightweight for its volume. In the
summer, growth slows. Denser "latewood" is formed, creating a band that is relatively
dark when you look at the end of a piece of lumber. But occasionally, the sequence of a
perfect pair of springwood and latewood does not hold up. If conditions-weather or
Page 63 of 269
disease-severely test a tree one year, it will not grow over all its surfaces. That may mean
that a particular sample of wood taken by the dendrochronologist will have a missing ring
in it, which will result in the scientist's inferences being off base by a year.
A few trees also may trip up scientists by revealing a "false ring" made of latewood that's
in the middle of springwood. These features, sometimes known as double rings, usually
can be distinguished from true rings because the unusual dark ring is likely to change
gradually rather than more abruptly into the springwood that lies on either side of the false
latewood. It is not clear what creates such double rings, although people have speculated
that unusual conditions during the middle of the growing season or even highly local
issues might be the cause.

15.2: The Problem with Microplastics
Scientists think that about 10 percent of all plastic, which includes plastic bags and bottles,
ends up in the ocean. The attributes that make plastic a useful material for a large number
of products are its light weight and the strong chemical bonds in its internal structure,
which make the material durable. Because plastic by itself is less dense than water, it
floats along the ocean surface, where it is continuously exposed to ultraviolet light from
the Sun, which has the effect of loosening its chemical bonds. Ocean waves smash these
weakened pieces of plastic against each other, and they are broken down into smaller
and smaller pieces, eventually creating vast numbers of microplastics (pieces less than
5 millimeters across) that disperse throughout the water.
Due to the widespread increase in plastic production, there is six times as much plastic
in the oceans as there was 40 years ago. Based on the amount of manufactured plastic,
scientists have estimated that there are many trillion pieces of plastic in the ocean. To
obtain a more precise idea about the amount, scientists conducted a study in 2010-2011
that involved sampling the ocean surface at 141 locations. After six months, they
concluded that only 7,000 to 35,000 tons of plastic were present on the ocean surface. It
is widely believed, however, that tens of millions of tons of plastics have entered ocean
waters. Moreover, the scientists primarily found larger pieces of plastic, which means that
the number of microplastics found diverged from expectations to an even greater degree.
Scientists have attempted to explain the apparent disappearance of vast amounts of
plastic from the surface of the ocean. Plastic is hydrophobic-it repels water, like oil doeswhich by itself contributes to its buoyancy (ability to float). However, this hydrophobic
quality attracts single-celled organisms, such as diatoms and bacteria, which attach
themselves to the plastic's surface and replicate. Over time, the resulting biofilm (layer of
organisms) alters the density of the plastic and reduces its degree of hydrophobia,
increasing its chances of sinking. Organisms residing in the biofilm release certain
chemicals that attract other organisms, including barnacles, aquatic insects, and algae,
which make their homes on the plastic. This adds to the plastic's weight and further
increases its chances of sinking. In one experiment, scientists submerged plastic food
bags for three weeks, measuring the amount of biofilm and buoyancy of the bags each
week. The bags sank deeper during each week of the experiment. Severe coastal storms
and vertical movement of water associated with differences in temperature or salinity may
be another reason why microplastics move into deeper waters. Scientists have found as
many as 40 pieces of microplastic per 50 milliliters of sediment in locations sampled along
the ocean floor.
Some of the microplastics are likely ingested (eaten) by ocean organisms. Many marine
invertebrates (animals lacking a backbone) are filter feeders-they draw water into their
bodies and ingest tiny bits of food contained within it. These animals do not discriminate
among food items and can easily take in plastics along with the rest of their meal. Thus,
scientists have found microplastics in the bodies of marine organisms, including
Page 65 of 269
zooplankton, crabs, fish, and marine worms. Although the plastic by itself can remain in
or pass through the animals' bodies without significantly affecting them, many plastics
come with pollutants left over from the manufacturing process or picked up as the plastics
travel through the oceans, and these chemicals are often harmful to the animals.
Copepods-tiny, free-swimming organisms that eat algae-are among the filter feeders that
have been found to ingest microplastics. But then, in an apparent attempt to avoid taking
in even more of these materials, copepods switch to feeding on smaller algae, ones that
are even tinier than microplastics. As a result of this diet change, copepods' energy intake
can drop by as much as 40 percent. These copepods lay smaller eggs that are unable to
hatch successfully. Microplastics may also get stuck in the antennae of copepods and
other zooplankton, where they interfere with the organisms' ability to sense food in the
surrounding waters and also in copepods' joints, limiting their ability to move and catch
prey.

16.1: The Rise of the Maya
A hundred and fifty years of painstaking archaeological inquiry allows us today to
understand how the Maya emerged to transform the rain forest of Central America into a
scene of urban civilization. By 1000 B.C., the Maya were settled agriculturalists growing
a variety of crops in clearings in the forest, which they turned into villages. They appear
to have lived in a society of equals, without clear rulers or ceremonial centers. Then
between 800 and 500 B.C., signs of a ruling elite within Maya society start to emerge in
the form of elaborate burial monuments. At Los Mangales in the Salama Valley of highland
Mexico, a chief was buried on a special mortuary platform accompanied by rich grave
goods of jade and shell. Slightly later, the ceremonial center at El Portón was built,
involving the construction of earth terraces and platforms, on which were located altars
and standing stones; one with a brief written inscription, although too damaged to be read
today.
In the lowlands of Guatemala and the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico, vast ceremonial
centers appeared quite suddenly after 600 B.C. At Nakbe in northern Guatemala, the site
was swiftly transformed from a modest village into a city with a major monumental
structure at its heart. A massive platform was constructed on the ruins of the original
settlement, on top of which were a series of terraced buildings up to 60 feet tall. Without
any doubt, we can see here the development of a more complex society. From 400 B.C.
to Ad A.D. 250, major ceremonial centers developed in all parts of the Maya area, many
carved out of the tropical rain forest that covered the southern lowlands of Guatemala. ,
Belize, and Mexico. These cities were dominated by enormous terraced platforms, some
forming giant temple- pyramids. Vast palaces of limestone masonry with vaulted rooms
were constructed. , set within architectural layouts that emphasized the most important
buildings of a city, arranged around plazas with rows of standing stones lined up in front
of them. A highly sophisticated art style emerged, seen in bas-reliefs, wall paintings, and
beautiful pottery with multicolored fired decorations. Hieroglyphic writing became
widespread, and inscriptions can be dated using the Maya Long Count, an elaborate but
incredibly accurate calendarical system.
Earlier generations of archaeologists considered the great Maya cities to be purely
ceremonial centers. In this view, the cities were occupied only by their peace-loving
priestly rulers and their attendants except at great festivals. The British Mayanist Sir Eric
Thompson, working at the Field Museum of Chicago, suggested that the Maya character
encouraged the development of religious authority, and that their devoutness, discipline,
and respect for authority would have facilitated the emergence of a theocracy.
This was not, however, an age of peace ruled over by unworldly priests living in solitude
among the temples. In the last 25 years, a succession of remarkable breakthroughs has
enabled us to read the Maya's hieroglyphic language. Whereas Thompson and others
assumed that inscriptions outside temples concerned complex matters of astronomy and
calendric systems that fascinated the priests, the translations now available show beyond
Page 67 of 269
any doubt that the cities were ruled by an aristocracy that was firmly secular (not based
on religion) and indeed warlike in outlook. Hieroglyphic writing on monuments was mainly
used to record the achievements of Maya rulers, especially in war. Victory stones were
erected outside the temples, bearing the names of famous captives. Great monuments
were liberally marked with the names and faces of the rulers who commissioned them.
Excavation has also played its part in overturning the established picture of Maya cities.
Vital evidence that the cities were not just ceremonial centers has now been found at
many lowland sites. On the outskirts of cities such as El Mirador are groups of low,
rectangular mounds of earth and stone long ignored, but which archaeological
investigations have now shown were occupied by small wooden houses, raised above
the level of the summer flooding-humble dwellings that housed the ordinary inhabitants
who served the aristocrats living in palaces at the heart of the city.

16.2: The Agricultural Revolution
During a relatively warm climatic period between 8000 and 6000 B.C., humans on the
fringes of Mesopotamia began to shift from a hunting-gathering existence and started to
control the animals and plants they would eat, thus initiating the Agricultural or Neolithic
Revolution. That it was a revolution, there can be no dispute. It transformed the way
human beings lived and shattered a tradition over two million years old. However, why
the Agricultural Revolution occurred at this precise time is still largely a matter of
conjecture. Why, for instance, did it not occur during one of the earlier interglacial periods
(intervals of relatively warm climate that occurred periodically between ice ages over
millions of years) when, presumably, the same conditions prevailed? It is difficult to find
any uniformly satisfying answers. We know that agriculture developed more or less
simultaneously in many different parts of the globe, so it is unlikely that it resulted from
any single cause, such as climatic change or population growth, although both have been
offered as explanations. We also know that the move to agriculture was not always
permanently successful. In some places, it was tried for a while and then abandoned. It
is even possible that certain plants and animals were domesticated more than once and
by different people.
Most modern explanations of the origins of agriculture tend to emphasize the role of
microenvironments and long-standing human-plant and human-animal relationships.
Such factors as changing climatic conditions, the presence of animals and plants that
offered good potential for domestication, and the cultural and technological levels of
achievement of the human populations present undoubtedly played important roles in the
development of agriculture.
The key to understanding agriculture is the process known as domestication.
Domestication was the essential technological breakthrough that allowed human beings
to escape the age-old system of hunting and gathering and to control the production of
food rather than being at the mercy of what sustenance the terrain might offer at any given
moment.
Domestication can be defined as a primitive form of genetic engineering in which certain
plants and animals are brought under human control, their objectionable characteristics
eliminated, their favorable ones enhanced, and in the case of animals, inducing them to
reproduce in captivity. If wild animals cannot be induced to breed in captivity, they cannot
be domesticated. Modern domesticated cattle, sheep, and pigs, for example, look only
remotely like their leaner, meaner, and faster-moving ancestors. Domestication is best
viewed as the creation of an artificial environment in which the chosen plants or animals
come to exist exclusively. Left alone, domesticated species either die or revert to their
original wild forms. Because herds, farms, orchards, and gardens are permanent, static
entities, once they came into being, the old hunting-gathering forms of social organization
had to be replaced.
Page 69 of 269
Hunter-gatherers place a low value on possessions and a high value on mobility. Always
on the move, they carry only a few tools and weapons with them. Agriculture reverses this
way of life. It cannot be practiced without a commitment to permanence and the
accumulation of large amounts of material goods. Homes, villages, and storage facilities
must be constructed, fields cleared, divided, and fenced; herds built up and maintained;
and tools fabricated. Constant effort is required to maintain all of these. Once settled,
farmers may not move again for generations. Pastoralists (animal herders) are equally
committed to their flocks and herds.
For practical purposes, hunting-gathering bands always remained small, in the range of
30 to 50 people. Larger groups would have been difficult to sustain in most environments;
smaller groups could not reproduce themselves. Agriculture, by contrast, knew no limits
as far as population growth was concerned. Thus, where hunting-gathering bands
restricted their numbers, agricultural communities tended to expand them. People could
be put to work in the fields or gardens at an early age and at harvest time when it was
essential to maximize the number of people who could be mobilized. Overpopulation was
solved by emigrating and opening up new land for cultivation. By about 6000 B.C., villages
with populations in the thousands were common throughout the Middle East.

17.1: Christian Thomsen and Danish Artifacts
In 1807, the Danish Royal Commission for the Preservation and Collection of Antiquities
was established. It began to gather together a collection of antiquities (objects from the
ancient past) from all over Denmark that soon became one of the largest and most
representative in Europe. In 1816, the commission invited the scholar Christian Thomsen
to classify and prepare this collection for exhibition. The main problem that Thomsen
faced was how the diverse assortment of prehistoric material in the collection could be
exhibited most effectively. He decided to proceed chronologically by subdividing the
prehistoric period into successive ages of stone, bronze, and iron. The notion of
successive ages of stone, bronze, and iron was not merely speculation but a hypothesis
for which there was already some evidence.
In attempting to sort the prehistoric material in the collection into three successive
technological stages or eras, Thomsen faced a daunting task. He recognized that even
for the stone and metal objects, automatic classification would not work. Bronze and stone
artifacts had continued to be made in the Iron Age, just as stone tools had been used in
the Bronze Age. The challenge was, therefore, to distinguish bronze artifacts made during
the Iron Age from those made during the Bronze Age and to differentiate which stone
tools had been made in each era. There also was the problem of assigning objects made
of gold, silver, glass, and other substances to each period. Individual artifacts were no
help in beginning this work. Yet the Danish national collection contained sets of artifacts
that had been found in the same grave, collection, or other contexts and that could safely
be assumed to have been buried at the same time. Thomsen called these "closed finds"
and believed that, by comparing the various items from each such discovery and noting
which types of artifacts occurred together and which never did, it would be possible for
him to determine the sorts of artifacts that were characteristic of different periods.
Thomsen sorted and classified his artifacts into various use categories, such as knives,
adzes, cooking vessels, safety pins, and necklaces. He further refined each category by
distinguishing the artifacts according to the material from which they were made and their
various shapes. Having, in this way, established a set of informal artifact types, he began
to examine closed finds in order to determine which types did and did not occur together.
He also examined the decorations on artifacts and found that these, too, varied
consistently from one closed find to another. On the basis of shape and decoration, it
became possible for Thomsen to distinguish types of bronze artifacts that never occurred
together with iron artifacts from ones that did occur with them. He also was able to
demonstrate that large flint knives and spear points that had similar shapes to bronze
ones had been made at the same time as bronze artifacts. Eventually, he succeeded in
dividing the prehistoric artifacts in the collection into five distinct groups. Once these
groups were established, he could assign single artifacts to each group on the basis of
similarities in outward form and structure. Thomsen also studied the contexts in which
artifacts had been found and discovered that these varied consistently from one group to
Page 71 of 269
another.
Thomsen then proceeded to order his groups into a historical sequence. He identified the
simplest assemblages, which contained only chipped stone artifacts, as the remains of
an early Stone Age. This material came invariably from small, simple sites. Next was a
later Stone Age, which he described as the period when polished as well as chipped stone
tools were manufactured, and the first use was made of metal. At this time, the dead were
buried, uncremated, in prehistoric tombs, accompanied by crude pottery vessels with
incised decoration. In the full Bronze Age, both weapons and cutting tools were made of
bronze, the dead were cremated and buried in urns under small tumulimounds), and
artifacts were decorated with ring patterns. In the Iron Age, tools and weapons were made
of tempered iron, whereas bronze continued to be used to manufacture ornaments and
luxury goods. Thomsen divided the Iron Age into two stages, the earlier characterized by
curvilinear serpent motifs and the later by more elaborate dragons and other fantastic
animals.

17.2: Early Astronomy
As surviving records and artifacts make abundantly clear, many early cultures took a keen
interest in the changing nighttime sky. But unlike today, the major driving force behind the
development of astronomy in those early societies was probably neither scientific nor
religious. Instead, it was decidedly practical. Seafarers needed to navigate their vessels,
and farmers had to know when to plant their crops. In a real sense, then, human survival
depended on knowledge of the heavens. The ability to predict the arrival of the seasons,
as well as other astronomical events, was undoubtedly a highly prized, perhaps jealously
guarded skill.
The human brain's ability to perceive patterns in the stars led to the "invention" of
constellations as convenient means of labeling regions of the nighttime sky. The
realization that these patterns returned to the night sky at the same time each year met
the need for a practical means of tracking the seasons. Widely separated cultures all over
the world built elaborate structures to serve, at least in part, as primitive calendars, but
often early experts on astronomy enshrined their knowledge in myth and ritual, sometimes
turning sites used for astronomical observation into places for religious ceremonies.
Perhaps the best-known such site is Stonehenge, located on Salisbury Plain in England.
This ancient monument, which today is one of the most popular tourist attractions in
Britain, dates from the Stone Age. Researchers believe it was an early astronomical
observatory of sorts-not in the modern sense of the term (a place for making new
observations and discoveries pertaining to the heavens)--but rather a kind of threedimensional calendar or almanac, enabling its builders and their descendants to identify
important dates by means of specific astronomical events. Its construction apparently
spanned a period of about 17 centuries, beginning around 2800 B.C. Additions and
modifications continued until about 1100 B.C., indicating its ongoing importance to the
Stone Age and, later, Bronze Age people who built, maintained, and used Stonehenge.
The largest stones weighed up to 50 tons and were transported from many miles away.
Many of the stones are aligned so that they point toward important astronomical events.
For example, the line joining the center of the inner circle to the so-called heel stone set
off some distance from the rest of the structure, points in the direction of the rising Sun
on the summer solstice (the longest day of the year). Other alignments are related to the
rising and setting of the Sun and the Moon at other times of the year. The accurate
alignments (within a degree or so) of the stones at Stonehenge were first noted in the
eighteenth century, but it was only relatively recently-- in the second half of the twentieth
century, in fact--that the scientific community began to credit Stone Age technology with
the ability to carry out such a precise feat of engineering. While some of Stonehenge's
purposes remain uncertain and controversial, the site's astronomical function seems wellestablished. Although Stonehenge is the most impressive and the best preserved, other
stone circles found all over Europe are believed to have performed similar functions.

The early Chinese also observed the heavens. Their beliefs attached particular
importance to omens" such as comets, which are seen in the night sky only occasionally,
and "guest stars"-stars that appeared suddenly in the sky and then slowly faded awayand they kept careful and extensive records of such events. Twentieth-century
astronomers still turn to Chinese records to obtain observational data recorded during the
Dark Ages (roughly from the fifth to the tenth century A.D.), when turmoil in Europe largely
halted the progress of Western science. Perhaps the best-known guest star was one that
appeared in A.D. 1054 and was visible in the daytime sky for many months. We now know
that the event was actually a supernova-the explosion of a giant star-which scattered most
of its mass into space. It left behind a remnant that is still detectable today, nine centuries
later. The Chinese data are a prime source of historical information for supernova
research.

18. 1: The Switch to coal
In the United States and Great Britain, coal was not widely utilized until more easily
available energy resources, such as wood, were on the point of exhaustion. The shift to
fossil fuels and the corresponding rise in energy consumption is illustrated by the
transformation of the shipping industry in the nineteenth century. Until the mid-nineteenth
century, the world's ships had been powered by wind and human power. The first river
steamboats came into use around 1810-they first crossed the English Channel in 1821
and by 1839 had crossed the Atlantic. Technological developments, such as the
introduction of iron and steel hulls (watertight bodies of ships) in the 1850s and 1860s,
increased the effectiveness of sailing ships, and the largest could still compete with the
early, inefficient, and expensive steam-powered ships that operated from the 1840s. It
was the development of the high-pressure steam boiler made from steel that transformed
the situation. By the late 1860s, steamships could bring three times as much cargo from
China to Europe in half the time taken by sailing ships. The amount of steam-powered
shipping in the world rose from just 32,000 metric tons in 1831 to over three million metric
tons by the mid-1870s and then rose exponentially as sailing ships gradually died out and
the steamship took over the world's merchant and naval fleets. Britain built a chain of
coaling stations across the globe to sustain the worldwide deployment of the Royal Navy.
Not only had the amounts of shipping in the world increased dramatically, but its energy
demands had also increased even more.
The growing use of coal led to the rise of an important byproduct-the use of the waste
gases to provide the first non-natural source of lighting. Coal gas was first used to light a
factory in Great Britain in 1807 and, six years later, a cotton mill in the United States. The
advantage for the factory owners was that artificial lighting enabled far longer hours to be
worked. Coal gas was cheap to use for street lighting once the high installation costs
(laying gas pipes, known as mains, and installing new street lights) had been paid. It was
cheaper than whale oil and available in much greater quantities. Street lighting could
therefore spread on a much greater scale. By 1816, the first districts in London were lit
by gas supplied from a central coal-burning plant through underground mains. By the late
1820s, gas lighting had been adopted in Boston, New York (which depended on imported
British coal), and Berlin. The use of coal gas to light streets and houses and eventually
for cooking spread through the industrialized world in the nineteenth century.
The peak of the world's dependence on coal for its energy came up in the first decades
of the twentieth century. Coal's share of world energy consumption then fell from about
90 percent in 1900 to less than 25 percent in the early twenty-first century. However, coal
production continued to increase from about 760 million metric tons in 1900 to just over
5,000 million metric tons in 2000. The decline in the importance of coal occurred first in
the United States because of its large oil reserves. In Europe, the change came much
later. In 1950, coal still provided over 80 percent of the continent's energy. Yet by 1970,
the proportion had fallen to less than a third, as cheap imported oil replaced coal. Until
the 1950s, Europe's railways still depended on coal-fired steam engines, as they had over
Page 75 of 269
a century earlier. Then, in the space of a couple of decades, they were replaced by dieselpowered locomotives and electrified systems. In 1900, Britain was the second-largest
coal producer in the world, and the industry employed about 1,200,000 men. By the end
of the twentieth century, output was at 10 percent of the level of a century earlier, and
there were only 10.000 coal miners. The production also shifted from deep mines to openpit mining, which was much more destructive environmentally but cheaper. In the United
States, two-thirds of coal production now comes from open-pit mines. However, coal is
still the second-most-important energy source in the world. About 40 percent of the world's
electricity still comes from coal-fired plants, and in many countries of the world, it remains
the primary fuel.

18.2: Why Did Agriculture Begin?
Transitions from a glacial to an interglacial world occurred many times during the last two
million years. Through all but the most recent glaciation, people moved in response to
environmental changes rather than staying put and adapting to a new ecosystem. Then,
after living on the move for more than a million years, they started to settle down and
become farmers. What was so different when the glaciers melted this last time that
caused people to adopt a new lifestyle?
Several explanations have been offered to account for this radical change. Some argue
that the shift from a cool, wet glacial climate to less hospitable conditions put an
environmental squeeze on early people in the Middle East. In this view, hunters began
growing plants in order to survive when the climate warmed and herds of wild game
dwindled. Others argue that agriculture evolved in response to an inevitable process of
cultural evolution without any specific environmental pressure. Whatever the reasons,
agriculture developed independently in Mesopotamia, northern China, and Mesoamerica.
For much of the last century, theories for the origin of agriculture emphasized the
competing oasis and cultural evolution hypotheses. The oasis hypothesis held that the
postglacial drying of the Middle East restricted edible plants, people, and other animals
to well-watered flood plains. This forced proximity promoted social bonds, which
eventually led to domestication. In contrast, the cultural evolution hypothesis holds that
regional environmental change was unimportant in the gradual adoption of agriculture
through an inevitable progression of social development. Unfortunately, neither
hypothesis provides satisfying answers for why agriculture arose when and where it did.
A fundamental problem with the oasis theory is that the wild ancestors of our modern
grains came to the Middle East from northern Africa at the end of the last glaciation. This
means that the variety of food resources available to people in the Middle East was
expanding at the time that agriculture arose-the opposite of the oasis theory. So the story
cannot be as simple as the idea that people, plants, and animals crowded into shrinking
oases as the countryside dried. And because only certain people in the Middle East
adopted agriculture, the cultural evolution hypothesis falls short. Agriculture was not
simply an inevitable stage on the road from hunting and gathering to more advanced
societies.
The transition to an agricultural society was a remarkable and puzzling behavioral
adaptation. After the peak of the last glaciation, people herded gazelles in Syria and
Israel. Subsisting on these herds required less effort than planting, weeding, and tending
domesticated crops. Similarly, in Central America, several hours spent gathering wild corn
could provide food for a week. If agriculture was more difficult and time-consuming than
hunting and gathering, why did people take it up in the first place?
Increasing population density provides an attractive explanation for the origin and spread
Page 77 of 269
of agriculture. When hunting and gathering groups grew beyond the capacity of their
territory to support them, part of the group would split off and move to a new territory.
Once there was no more productive territory to colonize, growing populations developed
more intensive (and time-consuming) ways to extract a living from their environment.
Such pressures favored groups that could produce food themselves to get more out of
the land. In this view, agriculture can be understood as a natural behavioral response to
the increasing population.
Modern studies have shown that wild strains of wheat and barley can be readily cultivated
with simple methods. Although this ease of cultivation suggests that agriculture could
have originated many times in many places, genetic analyses show that modern strains
of wheat, peas, and lentils all came from a small sample of wild varieties. Domestication
of plants fundamental to our modern diet occurred in just a few places and times when
people began to more intensively exploit what had until then been secondary resources.

19.1: Causes of Amphibian Declines
A striking feature of amphibian population declines, and what sets them apart from the
general biodiversity crisis, is that they have occurred in some of the best-protected natural
areas. For example, Sierra Nevada Yellow-legged Frogs have disappeared from
wilderness areas high in the United States mountain range known as the Sierra Nevada.
While remote locations such as these have escaped obvious habitat alteration and
destruction, they are still being affected by human activities. Scientists have investigated
five possible causes for the mysterious rapid amphibian declines that have occurred in
such remote locations: (1) introduced nonnative species, (2) increased ultraviolet
radiation, (3) disease, (4) climate change, and (5) toxic contaminants, such as pesticides.
People introduce non-native species for a variety of reasons, including recreational
fishing, human food, and for biological control of pests. For example, as early as the
1800s, fish stocking of high-elevation lakes in the Sierra Nevada was done by horseback.
Today, trout are raised in hatcheries and dropped by airplane into remote sites in mountain
ranges throughout the West. Trout are heavy predators and will eat both tadpoles and
adult frogs, so they could easily be the cause behind some declines. While introduced
species such as trout have significant negative impacts on certain amphibian species,
scientists are concluding that they are not the predominant cause of rapid declines.
Increased ultraviolet radiation was long thought to play a role in declines, and it has
received much scientific attention. The release of ozone-destroying chemicals such as
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), formerly used in refrigerators, has resulted in increased
ultraviolet radiation reaching Earth's surface. Ultraviolet radiation can cause DNA damage
and affect animal immune systems. However, the largest number of rapid declines has
occurred in tropical mountain-slope forests where amphibians are sheltered from sunlight
by the forest canopy. Thus, ultraviolet radiation is unlikely to be a primary cause of these
declines.
In 1998, scientists discovered a previously unknown fungus that was associated with frog
die-off in both Australia and Panama. The fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, is in
the chytrid family of fungi and is the only member known to be a pathogen (cause of
disease) to vertebrates. The discovery of the chytrid fungus proved to be a turning point,
and now disease, particularly that caused by the chytrid fungus, has emerged as the
leading explanation for rapid amphibian population declines. Chytrid fungus has now
been found in more than 400 amphibian species and has been associated with population
die-offs in North, Central, and South America, as well as in Africa, Europe, Australia, and
New Zealand. While it is clear that chytrid fungus is the immediate cause of many rapid
amphibian-population declines, there is still much debate about the disease. Is chytrid
fungus a newly emerging disease, spreading and attacking defenseless amphibian
hosts? Or have recent environmental changes facilitated disease outbreaks by a
pathogen that has long been widespread?
Page 79 of 269
Global climate change, especially warming trends, could be contributing to chytrid fungus
outbreaks. Unusually hot spells may stress amphibians, which would weaken their
immune systems and make them more susceptible to disease. Another possibility is that
temperature shifts caused by climate change may create environments more favorable
for the growth of chytrid fungus. In addition, climate change may cause drier conditions,
forcing amphibians to congregate in smaller bodies of water, facilitating the transmission
of disease. All these factors point to a possible connection between climate change and
disease, but to date, the necessary research has not been done to determine if any of
these inks are actually operating.
Pesticides and other contaminants may facilitate disease also. Such chemicals can be
carried long distances from where they are applied and often wind up in remote
ecosystems. Studies have shown that contaminants can suppress immune systems in
many organisms, including amphibians, which may lead to disease outbreaks. In
California, researchers have found a strong association between the geographic pattern
of population declines of a number of frog species and the pattern of pesticide
applications. However, as with climate change, few studies have been conducted to
establish a clear link between contaminants, disease, and amphibian declines. More
research is clearly needed.

19.2: The Price Revolution
Unprecedented inflation, or the price revolution, swept through Europe in the sixteenth
century. The main cause of the price revolution was the population growth during the late
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The population of Europe almost doubled between 1460
and 1620. Until the middle of the seventeenth century, the number of mouths to feed
outran the capacity of agriculture to supply basic foodstuffs, causing the vast majority of
people to live close to subsistence (the minimum food necessary to live). Until food
production could catch up with the increasing population, prices, especially those of the
staple food bread, continued to rise.
The other principal cause of the price revolution was probably the silver that flowed into
Europe from the Americas via Spain, beginning in 1552. At some point, the influx of silver
may have exceeded the necessary expansion of the money supply and may have begun
contributing to inflation. A key factor in the price revolution, then, was too many people
with too much money chasing too few goods. The effects of the price revolution were
momentous.
The price revolution had its greatest effect on farming. Food prices, which rose roughly
twice as much as the prices of other goods, spurred ambitious farmers to take advantage
of the situation and to produce for the expanding market; the opportunity for profit drove
some farmers to work harder and manage their land better.
All over Europe, landlords held their properties in the form of manors. A particular type of
rural society and economy had evolved in these manors in the fourteenth and fifteenth
centuries. By the fifteenth century, much manor land was held by peasant tenants
according to the terms of a tenure (relationship between tenants and landlords) known in
England as copyhold. The tenants had certain hereditary rights to the land in return for
the performance of certain services and the payment of certain fees to the landlord.
Principal among these rights was the use of the commons-the pasture, wood, and pond.
For the copyholder, access to the commons often made the difference between
subsistence and real want because the land tilled on the manor might not produce enough
to support a family. Arable land was worked according to ancient custom. The land was
divided into strips, and each peasant of the manor was traditionally assigned a certain
number of strips. This whole pattern of peasant tillage and rights in the commons was
known as the open-field system. After changing little for centuries, it was met head-on by
the incentives generated by the price revolution.
In England, landlords aggressively pursued the possibilities for profit resulting from the
inflation of farm prices. This pursuit required far-reaching changes in ancient manorial
agriculture, changes that are called enclosure. The open-field system was geared toward
providing subsistence for the local village and, as such, prevented large-scale farming for
a distant market. In the open-field system, the commons could not be diverted to the
production of crops for sale. Moreover, the division of the arable land into strips reserved
Page 81 of 269
for each peasant made it difficult to engage in profitable commercial agriculture.
English landlords in the sixteenth century launched a two-pronged attack against the
open-field system in an effort to transform their holdings into market-oriented, commercial
ventures. First, they denied their tenant peasantry the use of the commons, depriving
poor tenants of critically-needed products; then they changed the conditions of tenure
from copyhold to leasehold. Whereas copyhold was heritable and fixed, leasehold was
not. When a lease came up for renewal, the landlord could raise the rent beyond the
tenant's capacity to pay. Both acts of the landlord forced peasants off the manor or into
the landlord's employ as farm laborers. With tenants gone, fields could be incorporated
into larger, more productive units. Landlords could hire labor at bargain prices because
of the swelling population and the large supply of peasants forced off the land by
enclosure. Subsistence farming gave way to commercial agriculture: the growing of a
surplus for the marketplace. But rural poverty increased because of the mass evictions of
tenant farmers.

20.1: Grinding Grain
It now seems that humans began to grind grain into flour earlier than was originally
thought. Grinding stones have been found at African and Asian sites dating from 200,000-
50,000 years ago. It was presumed at first that these stones were used primarily to grind
plant and animal materials, or minerals, to make pigments, rather than for the preparation
of foodstuffs. However, new findings from the Middle East raise the intriguing possibility
that some human groups may have been using grinding stones to process cereal grains,
such as wheat, and maybe other types of edible plants, as early as the Middle Paleolithic
Era (i.e. 50,000 years ago and earlier). But why is it such an advantage to grind cereal
grains before eating them? The main reason is that grinding breaks down the hard, fibrous
cereal grain to release the easily digestible starch granules contained within This served
two purposes. Firstly, it enabled people to save enormously on the wear and tear of their
teeth, compared to eating raw unprocessed grains. Unlike the teeth of grazing animals,
human teeth do not continue to grow after childhood. Tooth wear due to a diet high in fiber
and raw plants can result in the substantial erosion of molars (back teeth by early
adulthood). People with worn or absent teeth faced starvation unless they could find
alternative types of food that did not require chewing. Alternatively, they could try to find
another way of grinding the fibrous plant material before eating it. Perhaps it was one of
these incentives that led to the use of stone-grinding tools for seed processing.
The development of grinding technology would have been socially advantageous to a
human group. People would tend to keep their teeth for much longer, and thus older, more
experienced individuals could have lived longer, despite the ultimate loss of their teeth.
Such people could then serve their clan either as "grandparent" childcare givers or by
acting as instruments for the innovation and transmission of oral culture. The latter role
was a key adaptation in preliterate societies (societies without a writing system),
particularly in relation to strategies for food acquisition and technology in an era of
considerable climatic flux. The remembered knowledge of how their grandparents dealt
with the last arid period, including alternative food acquisition strategies, would have
enabled such surviving elders to greatly enhance the ability of their clan to deal with such
difficult situations.
Unfortunately, grinding seeds to make flour could be a mixed blessing. Depending on the
type of stone used, the prolonged and laborious process of grinding cereal grains would
produce small chips of stone that could get into the flour. People eating the products of
such flour every day would be repeatedly exposed to stone chips as they chewed their
food, and eventually, their teeth might become chipped and worn. This problem was
partially alleviated many millennia later by the invention of pottery, which enabled porridge
to be made from grains mixed with water and boiled without grinding.
The second, and more immediate, reason for grinding cereal grains is that it enables us
to produce a more attractive, sweeter tasting, more nutritious, and calorie-rich foodstuff.
Rather than a hard, dry, indigestible, tooth-destroying- cereal grain, people could enjoy
Page 83 of 269
foods such as seed cakes, biscuits, and all the various forms of bread that we still relish
so much today. Cereal grains that have been ground and processed into flour can be
much more easily digested due to the higher surface area that is available for digestive
enzymes (molecules that break down food). This means that not only the plentiful
starches but also the grain proteins and the much less abundant micronutrients are more
easily absorbed from processed cereals. In the cold, dry climate of the Last Glacial
Maximum, plants of the grass family, such as cereals, would have been a more reliable
source of food than woodland plants (e.g. nuts and berries). Many of these woodland
plants would have died out as the weather worsened, and edible animals would have also
become increasingly unavailable as they migrated to warmer climates, leaving cereals as
one of the few remaining options for the people who chose, or were obliged to remain in
the Middle East.

20.2: Machines and Manufacturing
The tremendous growth in European industry in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries
was the result of a number of changes, technology foremost among them. The
accumulation and diffusion of technical knowledge necessary for manufacturing began in
the countryside, where handicraft operations were gradually enlarged and mechanized.
Often, it was small-and medium-sized producers, and the occasional amateur
experimenter in a barn, who were the inventors and innovators. Numerous small
inventions, applied and diffused on both sides of the Atlantic, gradually built up a stock of
technical knowledge and practice that was widely available.
The most famous of these inventors was James Watt (1739-1819) of Scotland, who
succeeded in making steam engines more efficient. Steam engines burned coal to boil
water, which condensed into steam that was used to drive mechanized devices. Watt
devised a way to separate steam condensers from piston cylinders so that pistons could
be kept hot, and therefore, running constantly. This set the stage for a fuel-efficient
engine. Early prototypes of Watt's engine were used to pump water out of mines. After
moving to Birmingham in 1774, Watt joined forces with the industrialist Matthew Boulton
(1728-1809), who marketed the steam engine won an extension of the patent for another
twenty-five years, and set up a special laboratory for Watt so that he could refine his
device. Thus, technical exploration joined forces with the interests of business:
collaboration between inventors and entrepreneurs was a sign of the times. Moreover,
perhaps the most important aspect of Watt's engineering feat was that it was subject to a
stream of improvement and adaptation, not just from Boulton and Company, but from its
competitors as well.
The steam engine, driven by burning coal, provided vastly increased power and sparked
a revolution in transportation. Steam-powered ships and railroads, once inventors were
able to construct lighter engines that required less coal to run, slashed the time and cost
of long-distance travel. Steam power's diffusion accelerated when iron-making improved,
allowing for the production of railroad tracks and cables used to hang suspension bridges.
The first public rail line opened in 1830 in England, between Manchester and Liverpool.
During the next twenty years, railway mileage increased from less than 100 to almost
25,000 in England, France, Russia, and the German-speaking countries. Steamships
appeared in the 1780s in France, Britain, and the United States. and in 1807, Robert
Fulton inaugurated the first commercially successful route between New York City and
Albany on the Hudson River. A century of toying with boilers and pistons culminated in
the radical reduction of distances. Moreover, steam-powered engines also improved
sugar refining, pottery making, and many other industrial processes. Mechanizing
processes that would have taken much longer and been subject to human error if done
by hand, enabled manufacturers to make more products at cheaper costs.
Textile production was one of the areas that benefited from both technical changes and
the consolidation of different stages of the work in a factory. With new machinery, a single
Page 85 of 269
textile operator could handle many looms and spindles at once and could produce bolts
of cloth with stunning efficiency. Gone were the hand tools, the family traditions, and the
loosely organized and dispersed systems of households producing cloth in their homes
for local merchants to carry to markets. The material was also stronger, finer, and more
uniform. Thanks to such innovations, British cotton output increased tenfold between
1770 and 1790, leading to a 90 percent decline in the price of cloth between 1782 and
1812.
Most raw cotton for the British cloth industry had come from colonial India until 1793,
when the American inventor Eli Whitney (1765-1825) patented a device called a "cotton
gin" that separated cottonseeds from the fiber. Cotton farming quickly spread through the
southern states-from South Carolina into Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisianaas the United States came to produce more than 80 percent of the world's cotton supply
by the 1850s, thus the American South became a supplier of raw cotton to Britain.

21.1: The British Economy in the Eighteenth Century
The British economy expanded significantly in the eighteenth century, particularly with the
development of factory manufacturing. By the middle of the century, it had begun to alter
the northern English landscape. "From the Establishment of Manufacturers, we see
Hamlets swell into Villages, and Villages into Towns," exclaimed one gentleman in the
1770s. The production of manufactured goods doubled in the second half of the century.
Cotton manufacturing led the way: from 1750 to 1770, British cotton exports doubled. The
production of iron followed in importance, along with wool and woolen fabrics, linen, silk,
copper, paper, cutlery, and the booming building trades. Coal was substituted for wood
as fuel.
Despite its relatively small size, Britain had significant economic advantages over the
other nations of Europe, helping to explain why the manufacturing revolution began in
Britain. Unlike the German or Italian states, Britain was unified politically. People living in
England spoke basically the same language. France and the Italian and German states
still had internal tariffs that made trade more costly, whereas, in Britain, there were no
internal tariffs once the union between England and Scotland had been achieved in 1707,
creating Great Britain. The system of weights and measures in Britain had largely been
standardized. Indeed, Great Britain was by far the wealthiest nation in the world. Colonies
in faraway parts of the world provided raw materials for manufacturing and markets for
goods produced in Britain; for example, the amount of raw cotton imported from India
increased by twenty times from 1750 to 1800.
England's stable banking and credit arrangements also contributed to England's
advantage by facilitating the reinvestment of agricultural and commercial profits in
manufacturing. London's banks, particularly the giant Bank of England, were profitable
and respected. Merchants and manufacturers accepted paper money and written orders
for payment or bills of exchange with confidence. Gentry, or those who owned land,
invested in overseas trade expeditions and in manufacturing without the reticence of
landowners on the European continent. London's financial market could provide
information twice a week on what investments were worth in Amsterdam and Paris. Jointstock companies, which had begun in the late seventeenth century, offered investors
shares in their businesses together with limited personal liability, which meant that in the
case of a company's financial disaster, individual investors would be liable only to the
extent of their investments.
Expanded demand for manufactured goods led to a dramatic improvement in Britain's
transportation systems. A new process of road surfacing-using small pieces of stone
mixed with tar-improved travel on the main routes. Major roads were extended and
improved, as investors formed turnpike trusts, repairing the highways and turning a profit
by charging a toll to travelers using them. In 1700, it took 50 hours to travel the 180
kilometers from Norwich to London by coach: by 1800, the journey could be achieved in
19 hours. Moreover, England's water transportation was unmatched in Europe, a gift of
Page 87 of 269
nature. Rich sources of coal and iron ore lay near waterways and could be transported
with relative ease along the coast. No part of England stands more than 70 miles from
the sea. Navigable rivers and canals built in the middle decades of the century also
facilitated the transportation of raw materials and manufactured goods.
Finally, the British government offered business people more assistance than any
continental rivals could anticipate from their own governments. The powerful Royal Navy
protected the merchant fleet, which tripled during the first three-quarters of the century.
Laws forced foreign merchants to ship export goods to Britain in British ships, bowing to
pressure from woolens producers. The British government in 1700 imposed protective
tariffs on imported silk and calico (printed cotton fabric). Agreements with the Dutch
Republic and France in the late 1780s reduced trade tariffs with those states, which
helped British exports. Furthermore, the political influence of business people kept taxes
low.
Yet the British government rarely interfered in the operations of the economy in ways that
businesses might have considered intrusive. Adam Smith (1723-1790), who emerged as
the most important economic theorist of the time, rejected prevailing theories that
prescribed more government control of the economy, instead extolling economic
liberalism-that is, relatively little government intervention.

21.2: Characteristics of Sixteenth-Century European Towns
Size, legal status, or presence of fortifications (walls or other defensive barriers) might
seem natural criteria in defining the distinction between town and village in sixteenthcentury Europe. Ultimately, however, it was none of these, but rather "urban" functions,
that distinguished even the smallest towns from villages. Some villages could be relatively
large. Some had their own walls. On the other hand, many towns were unfortified and
lacked legal status as a town.
Early modern towns were multifunctional. Whether they were large or small, this was what
they shared, and this, in turn, is what distinguished them most from rural settlements. Not
all of these functions were economic, but the economic functions were the foundations
upon which all others were constructed. Only newly established military towns, such as
Palmanova in northeastern Italy or Neuf-Brisach on the Franco-Imperial border, and the
occasional ecclesiastical center were an exception to this pattern. Without the money and
demographic momentum generated by economic activity, towns were not selected as the
location for administrative centers, law courts, capital cities, colleges, and universities,
Cathedrals, or the sites for religious orders. They might be transformed in the process, as
were Madrid when it was chosen definitively by Philip ll in 1561 as the capital of Spain,
and Weilburg in Hesse, which was reconstructed for a similar purpose in the late
seventeenth century by Count Johann Ernst of Nassau, but the preconditions for growth
were already there.
Five economic functions distinguished towns from the countryside: their location as
centers for exchange; the presence of artisans; occupational diversity; regular links with
other centers of exchange; and influence over a hinterland or rural area far from any town.
These distinguishing characteristics were then reinforced by social and cultural indicators,
such as more complex forms of government, the presence of a stratified society with an
identifiable elite, the presence of professionals, such as lawyers or schoolteachers, and
religious orders and educational establishments. As time passed, new cultural indicators
were added, such as discussion groups and charitable societies.
By using these urban characteristics and indicators, it is possible to suggest that centers
of all sizes in Western Europe shared a common urban identity. Consider two Italian urban
centers: Venice and the Sicilian town of Gangi, which, while not quite at the opposite ends
of the urban spectrum, are usually considered to belong to totally different spheres. Gangi
had a population of some 4,000 in the mid-sixteenth century. Two-thirds of its inhabitants
were engaged in agriculture. The others were artisans, shopkeepers, merchants,
servants, rentiers (people whose earnings are derived from rent on properties), and
members of religious orders. At the height of its prosperity at the end of the sixteenth
century, on the other hand, Venice had a population of 190,000. It was a major
international trading center, supported by a substantial industrial sector, and was the
capital of an extensive maritime and land-based empire. It had a significant number of
merchants, renters, and professionals among its permanent population. As a point of
Page 89 of 269
departure for pilgrims and a point of arrival for tourists, it also functioned as a center of
hospitality. Servants and others engaged in the business of food, drink, and hotels swelled
the already large numbers who worked in the households of the permanent residents. In
spite of these substantial contrasts, both Gangi and Venice shared the basic economic
functions and the social and cultural indicators that have already been discussed. Both
functioned, above all, as centers of exchange, which linked their rural hinterlands to longdistance trading networks. Gangi lay on the old Roman road between Palermo and
Messina and was an important center for the export of livestock and wine. Venice's
strategic location at the head of the Adriatic Sea enabled it to link the eastern and western
Mediterranean with the producers and consumers of central Europe. It was also a center
of exchange for goods emanating from northern Italy. Each town had its important public
buildings and churches, a central square, and large houses belonging to an elite. Each
had its cultural identity. Comparisons of similar kinds could be made from any region of
Europe.

22.1: Origins of Earth's Salty Oceans
Scientists have long been interested in discovering the origin of Earth's water and
establishing why Earth's oceans are so salty. There has been speculation that the earliest
Earth was so hot that no liquid water existed, and all light elements (such as hydrogen
and oxygen) were rapidly stripped away from Earth by the solar wind (a stream of charged
particles emitted by the Sun). If this were true, then the elements needed to form water
on Earth would not have been freely available. As a consequence, it was proposed that
collisions with icy comets or similar gas-and water-rich materials brought water to Earth
after the planet had sufficiently cooled to retain it. This concept was supported by
comparisons of the gas compositions of meteorites with those of rocks from beneath the
Earth's surface, notably using krypton and xenon, nonmetallic gases that do not react with
other materials. There certainly is enough ice in space to have supplied our water (and
atmosphere) in this manner.
In July 2015, the space probe Philae, which landed on comet Churi, discovered not only
ice and dust but also 16 types of organic compounds, present not in a loose distribution
but in discrete clumps. Suddenly, the idea gained lots of traction that comets brought not
only water but also the ingredients for life, even in ready-made clumps. Intriguingly, in
October 2015, it was reported that-as this comet slowly thaws-molecular oxygen (02)
escapes in a constant and high proportion (1% to 10%) relative to water, which suggests
that the comet also contains a surprising amount of primordial (ancient) oxygen, which
was incorporated during the comet's formation.
Other work favors an alternative explanation. This work found that the hydrogen isotope
ratio (the proportion of different forms of hydrogen) of ice in comets may be different from
that of water on Earth. It instead emphasizes that the chemical composition of water on
Earth resembles that of the small percentage of water contained within rocky meteorites
and, thus, in asteroids, which are essentially very large meteorites. Thus, a theory was
developed that the asteroids planetesimals and protoplanets that clumped together to
form Earth had carried enough water in their rock minerals to explain our oceans. It would
have escaped from the planet's interior as steam, which in turn would have condensed
into water at the surface and in the early atmosphere. Calculations indicate that this
mechanism can also provide plenty of water to explain Earth's observed water content.
We have a complete understanding of the origin of salt in our oceans. It represents an
accumulation of dissolved minerals over tens of millions to hundreds of millions of years.
These minerals were broken up and dissolved during chemical weathering. We are all
familiar with this process from limestone buildings that become pitted or smoothed by the
action of water, wind, and weather; this is where the term weathering comes from. The
key process at work is one of the chemical reactions between the rock and the water, with
an important role for gases that are dissolved in water, such as carbon dioxide or sulfur
dioxide, since these make the water more corrosive. The chemical weathering reactions
break up rock minerals into charged atoms or molecules, called ions, which are removed
Page 91 of 269
in solution by river water and groundwater. This is exactly what happens when you
dissolve table salt in water: the mineral salt breaks down into sodium and chloride ions
that are held in a solution.
The early atmosphere contained high levels of carbon dioxide, or CO2. This gas is easily
dissolved in water, forming a mildly acidic solution. In the Co2-rich early atmosphere, this
resulted in corrosive acid rain that was highly effective at chemically weathering rocks,
and fresh volcanic rocks are especially easily weathered. The intense weathering
released dissolved minerals in the form of ions into river water and groundwater. From
early times onward, river and groundwater flow transported the dissolved minerals to their
final collection point, the ocean basins. Given the extremely slow input and removal of
salts, it becomes clear that the oceans' vast store of salt has accumulated because the
oceans have, for ages, been the end station for salt transport. Meanwhile, water itself
continually evaporates from the oceans-concentrating its salts, and the evaporated fresh
water continues the weathering cycle.

22.2: Latin America in the Nineteenth Century
A series of wars that took place between 1808 and 1826 brought independence to most
former colonies of Spain and Portugal in Latin America. After winning their independence,
the new Latin American states began a long, uphill struggle to achieve economic and
political stability. They faced immense obstacles, for independence was not accompanied
by economic and social changes that could spur rapid progress. Large estates, generally
operated using primitive methods and highly exploited labor, continued to dominate
economic life. Far from diminishing, the influence of the landed aristocracy (established
upper social class) actually increased. This was the result of the leading military role it
had played in the wars of independence and the passing of Spanish authority.
Economic life stagnated, for the anticipated large-scale influx of foreign capital did not
materialize, and the European demand for Latin American staples remained far below
expectations. Free trade brought increased commercial activity to the coasts, but this
increase was offset by the near destruction of some local craft industries by cheap,
factory-made European goods. The sluggish pace of economic activity and the relative
absence of interregional trade and true national markets encouraged local selfsufficiency, isolation, political instability, and even chaos.
As a result of these adverse factors, the period from about 1820 to about 1870 was, for
many Latin American countries, an age of violence and alternate dictatorship and
revolution. Its symbol was the caudillo (strongman), whose power was always based on
force, no matter what kind of constitution the country had. Usually, the caudillo ruled with
the aid of a coalition of lesser caudillos, each supreme in his region. Whatever their
methods, the caudillos generally displayed some regard for republican (representative
government) ideology and institutions. Political parties, bearing such labels as
"conservative" and "liberal," were active in most of the new states. Conservatism drew
most of its support from the great landowners and their urban allies. Liberalism typically
attracted provincial landowners, professional people, and other groups that had enjoyed
little power in the past and were dissatisfied with the existing order. As a rule,
conservatives sought to retain many of the social arrangements of the colonial era and
favored a highly centralized government. Liberals usually advocated a federal form of
government (in which power is distributed between a central government and regional
authorities), guarantees of individual rights, lay (nonreligious) control of education, and
an end to special privileges for the clergy and military. Neither party displayed much
interest in the problems of the native peasantry and other lower-class groups.
Beginning in about 1870, the accelerating tempo of the Industrial Revolution in Europe
stimulated more rapid change in the Latin American economy and politics. European
capital flowed into the area and was used to create the facilities needed to expand and
modernize production and trade. The pace and degree of economic progress of the
various countries were very uneven and depended largely on their geographic position
and natural resources.
Page 93 of 269
Extreme one-sidedness was a feature of the new economic order in which one or two
products became the basis of each country's prosperity, making these commodities highly
vulnerable to fluctuations in world demand and price while other sectors of the economy
remained stagnant.
The late nineteenth-century expansion was accompanied by a steady growth of foreign
control over the natural and human-made resources of the region.
Thus, by 1900, a new structure of dependency, or Colonialism, had arisen, called
neocolonialism, with Great Britain and, later, the United States replacing Spain and
Portugal as the dominant powers in the area.
The new economic order demanded peace and continuity in government, and after 1870,
political conditions in Latin America did, in fact, grow more stable. Old party lines
dissolved as conservatives adopted the dogma of science and progress, while liberals
abandoned their concern with constitutional methods and civil liberties (protections for
individuals against unjust government interference) in favor of an interest in material
prosperity. The cycle of dictatorship and revolution continued in many lands, but the
revolutions became less frequent and less devastating.
These major trends in the political and economic history of Latin America in the period
extending from about 1820 to 1900 were accompanied by other changes in the Latin
American way of life and culture-notably, the development of a powerful literature that
often sought not only to mirror Latin American society but to change it.

23.1: The Meaning of Upper Paleolithic Art
The period beginning 40,000 years ago (the Upper Paleolithic) witnessed a marked
increase in human artistic and symbolic expression. At about this time, a large number of
statues carved from bone or stone began to appear in the archaeological record, as do
magnificent paintings of animals that were hunted and animals that were not, as well as
other images on cave walls and ceilings. It is difficult for modern viewers to remain
unmoved by these images, but what did these works mean to their creators, and why did
they create them?
Some researchers regard Paleolithic artwork as part of a system of communication of
ideas-a system that uses animals and geometric patterns as symbols, the specific
meaning of which may be lost forever. Anthropologist Meg Conkey views the 1,200 bones
engraved with abstract geometric patterns at Altamira Cave, Spain, as the identifying
symbols-the "flags"-of different groups of people who came together at the cave during
certain periods. Archaeologist Michael Joachim views the cave paintings of northern
Spain and southern France (the so-called Franco-Cantabrian region) as symbols marking
territory. Social stresses that accompanied the population influx into the region during the
period beginning 25,000 years ago may have resulted in the need to mark territory with
symbols of ownership. Painting animals-probably the most important resources of a
territory-within a sacred place in the territory, like a cave, might have served to announce
to intruders the rightful ownership of the surrounding lands. Archaeologist Clive Gamble
views the small stone statues of female figures, known as Venus figurines, as a symbolic
social glue, helping to maintain social connections between geographically distant groups
through a common religion and art style.
More recently, researchers Patricia Rice and Ann Paterson have returned to a more
economic perspective. Their statistical analysis of the numbers and kinds of animals seen
on cave walls in the European Upper Paleolithic shows interesting correlations with the
collections of animal remains found at habitation sites in Spain and France. Small, nonaggressive animals such as reindeer and red deer were important in the diet of the cave
painters and seem to have been depicted on cave walls in proportion to their economic
importance. In addition, animals whose remains are found less often at archaeological
sites, but that were impressive, dangerous, and produced large quantities of meat when
they were successfully hunted, were commonly included in the artwork as well. So it would
appear that cave painters wanted to depict animals that were important food sources.
However, the relatively recently discovered Chauvet Cave contradicts this pattern, with
its stunning depictions of animals not known to have been exploited for food by Paleolithic
Europeans, including carnivores like lions, bears, and panthers, as well as woolly
rhinoceroses.
A neuron-psychological approach has been applied by researchers J. D. Lewis-Williams
and T. A. Dowson to explain at least some of the less naturalistic cave art. They note that
there are six basic geometric forms that people who are placed into an altered state of
Page 95 of 269
consciousness (for example, through hypnosis) under experimental conditions report
seeing: dots, wavy lines, zigzags, cross-hatching or grids, Concentric circles or U-shaped
lines, and parallel lines. Interestingly, these geometric forms are precisely those seen in
some ancient cave art dating to more than 30,000 years ago.
Lewis-Williams and Dowson's approach is cross-cultural. In other words, they surveyed
a wide variety of historical and archaeological cultures, finding common images in artwork
all over the world. Lewis-Williams and Dowson point out ethnographic records of shamans
(priests) who, in an attempt to communicate with spirits or see into other worlds, fall into
a trance-like state by fasting, dancing, hyperventilating, going into isolation in absolute
darkness, undergoing sleep deprivation, or even ingesting natural hallucinogens. When
these shamans produce an artistic representation of what they have seen in their trances,
they often include geometric shapes that are also seen in Upper Paleolithic artwork.
These images from trances are not culturally controlled but result, in part, from the
structure of the optic system itself and are, therefore, universal. Perhaps through sleep
deprivation, staring at a flickering fire, or the ingestion of drugs, ancient shamans or
priests produced these images in their own optic systems. They then translated these
images to cave walls as part of religious rituals.

23.2: The Roots of Economic Transformation in England
England was the first nation in Europe to develop a social structure that strongly
supported the innovation and economic growth we associate with modern times.
England's advantages were many, some of them deeply rooted in geography and history.
This comparatively small realm contained an excellent balance of resources. The plain to
the south and east, where traditional centers of English settlement concentrated, was
fertile and productive. The uplands to the north and west possessed rich deposits of coal
and iron, and their streams had powered flour mills for hundreds of years. Proximity to
the sea was another natural advantage. No part of the island kingdom was distant from
the coast. At a time when water transport offered the sole economic means for moving
bulky commodities, the sea brought coal close to iron, raw materials close to factories,
and products close to markets. Above all, the sea gave Britain's merchants access to the
much wider world beyond their shores.
The efficiency of transport was critical in setting the size of markets. During the eighteenth
century, Britain witnessed a boom in the building of canals and turnpikes (roads that could
be traveled for a fee). By 1815, the country possessed some 2,600 miles of canals linking
rivers, ports, and other towns. In addition, few institutional obstructions to the movement
of goods existed. United under a strong monarchy, Britain was free of internal tariffs
(payments for goods transported across a border), unlike prerevolutionary France,
Germany, or Italy. English merchants everywhere counted in the same money, measured
their goods by the same standards, and conducted their affairs under the protection of
the common law. By contrast, in France, local regions differed in their legal codes and in
weights and measures, which complicated and slowed exchange. As the writer Voltaire
sarcastically remarked, the traveler crossing France by coach changed laws as frequently
as horses.
The English probably had the highest standard of living in Europe and generated strong
consumer demand for manufactured goods. English society was less stratified (divided
into groups based on status) than elsewhere in Europe, and the aristocracy was powerful
but much smaller. Primogeniture-the right of the eldest son to inherit the family's land-was
the rule both among the aristocratic members of the House of Lords and among the other
land-owning classes. Left without lands, younger sons had to seek careers in other walks
of life, and some turned toward commerce. They frequently obtained capital for their
ventures from their landed fathers and elder brothers. English religious minorities, chiefly
Calvinists and Quakers, formed another pool of potential businessmen; denied careers in
government because of their religion, many turned their energies to business enterprises.
A high rate of reinvestment is very important to industrialization; reinvestment, in turn,
depends on the skillful management of money by both individuals and public institutions.
Here again, Britain enjoyed advantages. Early industrial enterprises could rely on Britain's
growing banking system to meet their capital needs, a system which in the seventeenth
century was taken over by the goldsmiths of London, who accepted and guarded
Page 97 of 269
deposits, extended loans, and provided other financial services. In the eighteenth century,
banking services became available beyond London; the number of regional banks rose
from 300 in 1780 to more than 700 by 1810. English businessmen were familiar with
banknotes and other forms of commercial papers, and their confidence in paper money
facilitated the recruitment and flow of capital.
The founding of the Bank of England in 1694 marked a distinctive period in the history of
European finance. The bank took responsibility for managing England's public debt, sold
shares to the public, and faithfully met the interest payments due to the shareholders with
the help of government revenue, such as the customs duties efficiently collected on
Britain's extensive foreign trade. When the government needed to borrow, it could turn to
the Bank of England for assistance. This stability in government finances ensured a
measure of stability for the entire money market and, most importantly, held down interest
rates in both the public and private sectors. In general, since the late seventeenth century,
England's government was sensitive to the interests of the business classes, who, in turn,
had confidence in the government. Such close ties between money and power facilitated
economic investment.

24.1: Understanding Insects through Fossils
Although it has been estimated that insects account for roughly one-third of all animal
species alive today, insects are, on the whole, poorly represented in the available fossil
record, where many species are known from just a single specimen, and a high proportion
of fossil insects come from exceptional fossil deposits that are sporadically distributed in
time and space. Nonetheless, about 40,000 species of insects have been described as
fossils, with many more awaiting description. Foremost among insect-rich deposits are
ambers in which complete external preservation of insects is routine. Amber is the
fossilized resin of a few particular kinds of trees. Oozing out of the bark, this resin had the
ability to trap and surround insects, as well as other small animals, protecting them from
the normal processes of organic decay as it hardened into transparent, yellow or orange
amber. The chemical process of "amberization" could take up to 10 million years. During
this time, it was common for amber initially buried in the soil to be washed out by rivers
and redeposited in the sea.
Although the oldest amber comes from the Carboniferous period (360-290 million years
ago), the great majority of amber deposits were formed between the start of the
Cretaceous period（146 million years ago）and the present. They provide priceless
windows on the insects and other small animals living at the time in the forests where
amber-producing trees grew. Elsewhere in the fossil record, insects can be found in finegrained sedimentary rocks, such as clays and silts deposited in freshwater lakes and
sluggish rivers. Unlike the insects in amber, these fossils generally comprise only
fragments, particularly of wings or wing cases, although more complete examples can be
found, such as the dragonflies of the famous Jurassic Solnhofen Limestone of Bavaria.
The fossil record describes a multiplicity of insects that scientists have grouped according
to their features. The most basic categorization of insects is into a primitive group without
wings, called the Apterygota, and the winged Pterygota. Surviving apterygotes include
springtails and silverfish. They are now relatively rare, comprising less than 1 percent of
all insect species. Pterygotes are divided into those with wings that cannot be folded,
which are called the Palaeoptera, and a larger, more advanced group, the Neoptera,
capable of folding their wings close to the body. Mayflies, dragonflies, and damselflies are
all palaeopteran insects, while the neopterans include locusts, butterflies, and wasps.
In spite of its imperfection, the fossil record holds a lot of useful information about the
times of origination of insect groups that are alive today. Primitive wingless insects -the
apterygotes- appear to have undergone an initial diversification during the Devonian
period(416-359 million years ago), possibly even the Silurian period（444-416 million
years ago). Unfortunately, however, relatively few fossil insects of this age are known and
there is a great need for further discoveries. The oldest known fossil insect is currently
Rhyniognatha hirsti from the early Devonian fossils in Scotland. However, this species,
preserved in sinter (mineral sediment) from an ancient hot water spring that was active
between 400 and 412 million years ago, exhibits some advanced characteristics, implying
Page 99 of 269
that there are more primitive, older insects still to be discovered.
Fossil insects with preserved wings (Pterygota) first occur in the mid-Carboniferous. The
evolution of wings was accompanied by an increase in maximum body size. A remarkable
dragonfly called Meganeura with a wingspan approaching 70 cm has been described from
the late Carboniferous. This inhabitant of the forests is one of the largest insects ever to
have lived. The huge size of Meganeura has led to speculations about the composition
of the atmosphere at the time, the powered flight of such a large insect perhaps
demanding an atmosphere containing higher levels of oxygen than that of the present
day. Unfortunately, the fragmentary insect fossil record sheds little light on the origin of
flight, as the oldest winged insects already had fully formed wings.

24.2: Interplanetary Seeding
Some scientists believe that microbial life may be distributed across terrestrial planets by
interplanetary rocks. Rocks are capable of carrying microbes from the surface of one
planet, across hundreds of millions of miles of space, to neighboring planets. Each year,
Earth is impacted by half a dozen half-kilogram or larger rocks from Mars. These rocks
were blasted off Mars by large impacts and found their way to orbits that cross Earth's
path, where they eventually collided with Earth as meteorites. Nearly 10 percent of the
rocks blasted into space from Mars end up on Earth. All planets are impacted by
interplanetary objects large and small over their entire lifetimes, and the larger impacts
actually eject rocks into space and into orbit about the Sun.
A glance at the full Moon with binoculars shows long streaks, or rays, radiating from the
crater Tycho, located near the bottom of the Moon as seen by observers in the Northern
Hemisphere. The rays are produced by the fallback of impact debris (impact material)
ejected from the crater, which is 100 kilometers in diameter. The rays can be traced nearly
across the full observable side of the Moon, and such long "airborne" flight is evidence
that some ejecta （ejected materials） were accelerated to near-orbital speed. Debris
ejected at speeds higher than the escape speed（2.2 kilometers per second）did not fall
back but flew into space. It has long been appreciated that material could be ejected from
the Moon by impacts, but only in the relatively recent past have we realized that whole
rocks greater than 10 kilograms in mass could be ejected from terrestrial planets and not
be severely modified by the process. It was formerly believed that the launch process
would shock-melt or at least severely heat the ejected material. There was little
expectation that rocks capable of carrying living microbes from planet to planet would
survive the great violence of the launch. The discovery of lunar（Moon）rocks in
Antarctica showed that this is possible.
There is also a rare class of meteorites called SNCs, or Martian meteorites, that is widely
believed to be from Mars. The first suggestion that these odd meteorites might be Martian
was greeted with considerable skepticism. The discovery of lunar meteorites changed
this by proving that there actually was an adequate natural launch mechanism. The lunar
meteorites could be positively identified, because rocks retrieved by the Apollo program,
which brought astronauts to the Moon, showed that lunar samples have distinctive
properties that distinguish them from terrestrial rocks and normal meteorites derived from
asteroids （rocky objects that orbit the Sun and are smaller than planets). Positive linking
of the SNC meteorites with a Martian origin was a more complex process. It included
showing that gas trapped in glass in the meteorite matched the composition of the Martian
atmosphere, as measured by the Viking spacecraft that landed on Mars in 1976. The
general properties of the SNC meteorites revealed that they were basalts （dark-colored
volcanic rocks） formed on a large, geologically active body that was definitely neither
Earth nor the Moon. Because the atmosphere of Venus is too thick and its surface too
young, Venus was also ruled out as a source.
Page 101 of 269
The astounding discovery that meteorites from the Moon and Mars reach Earth has
profound implications for the transport of life from one planet to another. Over Earth's
lifetime, billions of football-size Martian rocks have landed on its surface. Some were
sterilized by the heat of launch or by their long transit time in space, but some were not.
Some Martian ejecta are only gently heated and reach Earth in only a few months. This
interplanetary transporter is capable of carrying microbial life from planet to planet. Like
plants releasing seeds into the wind, or palms dropping coconuts into the ocean, planets
with life could seed their neighbors. Perhaps, then, nearby terrestrial planets might
contain microbial life with common origins. The seeding process would be most efficient
for planets that have small velocities of escape（the minimum speed needed for an object
to break free from a planet's gravitational attraction） and thin atmospheres. In this
regard, Mars would be a more likely source than Earth or Venus.

25.1: Development of Mass Transportation in the United States
Before the development of cheap, reliable urban transportation in the United States
(U.S.), city size had been limited by the distance people could comfortably walk to work.
In such "walking cities," the radius rarely extended beyond a few miles, and people of all
classes lived and worked close to one another. By the end of the nineteenth century, the
walking city had metamorphosed into a sprawling, segmented city. Economic function and
income divided the city roughly into a concentric pattern. A central business district, or
downtown core, where few lived, was ringed by a manufacturing and wholesaling district,
where immigrants and the working lower-income classes jammed into tenements and
subdivided old houses. Beyond them was a stretch of lower-middle-class to middle-class
row houses or apartment buildings, where skilled, clerical, and some factory workers
resided. Then came the fringes of the city, where professionals, managers, and
businessmen retreated to their spacious homes, leading comfortable lives and tending
their manicured lawns and shrubs away from the stench, noise, dirt, and push-and-shove
of the city.
New means of transportation made possible the new urban geography of economic
integration and social segregation. As early as the 1820s and 1830s, such eastern cities
as Boston, New York, and Philadelphia had operated horse-dray public carriers called
omnibuses. Omnibus systems Spread rapidly through the 1850s, but the slow, heavy
vehicles accommodated few passengers, and high fares limited ridership. By the midcentury, steam-powered commuter railroads were pushing city boundaries outward for
the affluent. The New York Harlem Railroad connected the suburban village of Harlem
with New York, and the Chicago & Milwaukee Railroad linked communities such as
Evanston, Wilmette, and Lake Forest with Chicago.
At the same time, many cities had switched to horse-drawn streetcars. Rails smoothed
the ride, compared to the bouncing of omnibus wheels over cobblestones, and they made
possible larger conveyances and more rapid movement. By establishing fixed routes, the
horse railways promised riders predictability. They also broadened the compass of the
city to five miles or more. With lower fares, the horse car systems attracted a middle-class
clientele, who commuted to work downtown from newly developed residential areas, or
suburbs, on city borderlands. By the 1880s, horse-drawn streetcars were carrying almost
190 million passengers annually in the United States. Horse cars, however, were not as
clean, cheap, or reliable as needed. Technology soon replaced the horse cars with cable
cars, pulled by steam-driven, underground wire rope clamped to the car. Introduced in
San Francisco in 1873, cable cars proved especially effective there and in such other hilly
cities as Pittsburgh and Washington, D.C.
The most important advance in urban transit was the electric trolley. In 1888， on a
twelve-mile track in hilly Richmond, Virginia, Frank J. Sprague, a naval engineer and
former associate of Thomas Edison, demonstrated the practicality of powering streetcars
with electrical currents transferred from overhead wires to the Vehicle by a four-wheeled
Page 103 of 269
spring device, or troller. A frenzy of construction and conversion to electricity followed, as
city governments awarded generous trolley franchises to transit entrepreneurs. Trolleys
rolled along at twice the speed of horse cars, and the US system of flat-fee fares (the
same fare no matter how long the trip) with free transfers encouraged mass ridership. For
ten cents, one could escape the soot and smells of the city on a daily commute or, for the
poor, on a Sunday outing.
Mass ridership encouraged construction. In 1890, the nation had 5,700 miles of horsedrawn track and only 1,260 miles of electrified track; twelve years later, just 250 miles of
horse-drawn track remained in service, while the total length of electrified track had grown
to 22,000 miles. Transit companies tried to increase ridership by developing areas
surrounding cities. By the 1890s, the Peoples Railroad trolley in St. Louis ran out to Grand
Boulevard, a dirt road amid cornfields that the transit company was transforming into an
avenue worthy of its name. The company laid out private streets with fountains, and it
planted shade trees and shrubs to lure prospective home builders and buyers.
Everywhere in the urban United States, transit companies invested heavily in such
suburban real estate development, thereby encouraging population dispersal.

25.2: Spider Web Decorations
An evolutionary puzzle is provided by orb-weaving spiders (weavers of round webs) that
incorporate impressive zigzag lines of white ultraviolet silk into their webs, which would
seem to make the trap more obvious to the prey that the spider needs to catch. Given
that many insects can see ultraviolet light, one wonders how orb weavers could gain by
alerting potential victims to the danger posed by their webs. But perhaps these web
additions actually attract ultraviolet-reflecting bees that specialize in taking nectar from
ultraviolet-reflecting flowers. The fact that bees constitute the large majority of prey for
some spiders with ornamented webs supports this hypothesis.
On the other hand, it could be that spiders that have been catching many preys, simply
because their webs are in a good spot, are the spiders that tend to add decorations to
their webs. If this is true, then the correlation between web decorations and higher rates
of prey capture need not mean that the decorations cause the increase in prey capture.
Instead, perhaps high feeding rates provide the extra energy that the spiders need to spin
their web decorations, which they do for some purpose other than prey attraction. This
hypothesis can be evaluated by testing the prediction that spiders, given an abundance
of food, should invest more in web decorations than spiders deprived of food. Indeed, in
two species of orb-weaving spiders, females that received more food made significantly
larger decorations, and in one species, well-fed females were more likely to add
decorations to their webs than were food-deprived individuals.
If one places an orb-weaving spider in a wooden frame and lets it build a web there, so
that the web can be moved to a site chosen by the experimenter, then one can put two
such webs side by side in a field. In this way, one can compare the rate of prey capture
in an ornamented web with that in another web in the same spot whose decorations have
been removed--something that can be easily accomplished by cutting out the two web
lines that support the decoration (two web lines are also cut from the other web, but not
those that hold the decoration). Such an experiment controls for the effects of site
productivity. Under these conditions, the decorated web catches about a third less prey
than the undecorated one. Thus, web decorations involve a cost to foraging (obtaining
food), not a benefit, under some conditions.
If it is true that decorating one's web carries a cost in lost calories, what counterbalancing
benefit exists for this behavior? One possibility is that when passing birds see the bright
decorations, they swerve to avoid colliding with the web and getting covered in sticky silk.
If this is true, then in the experiment above, webs with decorations should have been less
often damaged by birds than webs without any "keep away" signals. And in fact, the actual
results from the experiment matched the predicted ones, with decorated webs damaged
by birds 45 percent less often than undecorated ones.
Another benefit of web decorations might come from having the added silk camouflage
(hide) the body of the web builder, making the spider less vulnerable to attack from its
Page 105 of 269
predators. Evidence in support of this explanation comes from a set of spiders whose
females regularly incorporate a silky egg sac into their webs. The spider perches (sits) on
this moderately conspicuous vertical tube of silk, eggs, and debris in ways that make her
much less visible to human observers, especially because the spider's color pattern
matches that of the egg sac so closely. Moreover, when the egg sac is experimentally
removed, the spider replaces it with a vertical strip composed entirely of silk, on which
she perches as if it were an egg sac. Given that the egg sac seems to be used as a
concealment aid, its replacement can be assumed to serve the same function.
More data on this point come from a study in which orb-weaving spiders that had built
webs with or without extra silk decorations in an enclosed area were exposed to wasps,
which hunt spiders and feed them to their offspring. In one experiment, only 32 percent
of the spiders with web decorations were captured, as opposed to 68 percent of those
without.

26.1: The Beginning of Planet Formation
The four innermost planets of our solar system-Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars-are
terrestrial, or rocky planets. The beginning of their creation process occurred when the
cloud of leftover material from the formation of the Sun settled into a disc around the
young star. Most of the material in the cloud, like the material of the Sun itself, was in the
form of hydrogen and helium. But there was a trace of dust, no more than 2 percent of
the original material, in the form of particles as fine as the particles in smoke. The heat
from the young Sun blew much of the gas away, but the rotation of the original cloud
ensured that the dust settled into a disc around the young Sun-a protoplanetary disc like
the ones seen around young stars today.
Within the disc, all the particles were moving in the same direction around the Sun, like
runners going round a track. This meant that when they bumped into one another, they
did so relatively gently, not in head-on collisions, giving the particles a chance to stick to
one another. The tendency to stick may have been helped by electric forces produced by
particles rubbing against one another, in the same way that you can make a child's balloon
stick to the ceiling after rubbing it on a woolen sweater. Another important factor was
turbulence in the gas, creating swirling structures like whirlwinds that gathered pieces of
material together and gave them a chance to interact. Computer simulations show how
objects as big as Ceres can form in this way-provided the particles can stick together.
Something else may also have helped the particles to stick together-something else that
is special about the solar system. Studies of pieces of rock from meteorites show that the
dusty disc around the young Sun contained tiny globules of material, known as
chondrules, formed by melting at temperatures between 1,200 degrees Centigrade and
1,600 degrees Centigrade. Molten, or partly molten, blobs would be more sticky and
encourage the buildup of larger lumps of stuff in the disc. But how did they get so hot?
The most likely explanation is that the heat was released by radioactive elements that
had been sprayed by a nearby star in the process of dying into the gas cloud from which
the planets formed. One possibility is that a supernova occurred close to the cloud that
became the Sun just before the Sun formed; it is even possible that the blast wave from
this explosion triggered the collapse of the gas cloud that became the Sun and solar
system. Supporting evidence for this idea comes from measurements of the proportions
of various isotopes (different forms of an element) found in meteorites. Radioactive
aluminum-26 seems to have been present in the proto-solar system from the beginning,
but a pulse of iron-60 arrived about million years later. This matches what we know about
the fate of a very large star, with more than 30 times as much mass as the Sun. In the
late stages of its life, the star first blows away much of the outer layers of material, which
by then is relatively rich in aluminium-26， in a wind easily strong enough to cause any
nearby gas cloud to collapse. The star only explodes at the very end of its life, showering
the neighborhood with elements including iron-60.
There is a rival idea, developed in Barcelona by Josep Trigo Rodriguez and colleagues,
Page 107 of 269
which suggests that the radioactive material was fed into the solar system as it was
forming from a much less massive star which came much closer to the Sun. The right
proportion of isotopes could have come in the wind of material being blown away from a
star with only six times as much mass as our Sun in the last stages of its life. But the star
would have to be very close to the Sun for this to happen -closer than 10 light-yearswhich makes such an event unlikely, statistically speaking.

26.2: Species Competition
Interspecific competition occurs when two or more species seek the same limited
resource. In the 1930s, Russian biologist G. F. Gause devised a set of elegant laboratory
experiments that provide the basis for our formal understanding of competition. Gause
grew two different species of the single-celled Paramecium—P.aurelia and P. caudatum -
-separately and together. Populations of both species always increased more rapidly
when they were grown alone. When grown together, populations of both species grew
more slowly. Eventually, P. aurelia totally displaced P. caudatum. The results of his
experiments with Paramecium species, along with similar experiments he performed on
other organisms, led Gause to form this postulate: two species that directly compete for
essential resources cannot coexist; one species will eventually displace the other. This
postulate has come to be known as the competitive exclusion principle.
An acre of tropical forest may include over 100 species of trees, all of which depend on
the same soil, water, and nutrients. Freshwater lakes may have dozens of species of fish,
all of which feed on the planktonic algae and animals suspended in the water. Indeed,
two or more species of Paramecium may be found in the same lake. These and many
other examples from ecological communities in nature seem to contradict Gause's
principle. If two competing species cannot coexist in the laboratory, how are they able to
coexist in natural settings? This question has been the basis for hundreds of ecological
studies.
Ecologist G. Evelyn Hutchinson provided one of the most important explanations for the
coexistence of competing organisms. He proposed that each species has a fundamental
niche, the complete range of environmental conditions, such as requirements for
temperature, food, and water, over which the species might possibly exist. Hutchinson
noted, however, that few species actually grow and reproduce in all parts of this
theoretical range. Rather, species usually exist only where they are able to compete
effectively against other species. Hutchinson used the term realized niche to describe the
range of conditions where a species actually occurs given the constraints of competition.
Species whose fundamental niches overlap significantly are potential competitors.
Hutchinson suggested that these potential competitors are able to coexist because they
divide up the fundamental niche. Hutchinson called this division of resources niche
differentiation.
Niche differentiation occurs among many different kinds of organisms. For example, five
different species of warblers, small insect-eating birds, occur together in the evergreen
forests of the United States. During nesting season, the primary food of all the warblers
is caterpillars. Careful studies of the birds' feeding behavior reveal that each species
competes most effectively in a different part of the forest's highest layer, and that is where
each species can be found. The diverse grasses and herbs that grow in native prairies
provide another example of niche differentiation. Above ground, these plants appear to
be vying for the same space and resources. However, careful mapping of root systems
Page 109 of 269
shows that different species are adapted to exploiting different portions of the soil. In
addition, some species compete most effectively when growing in bright light, whereas
others compete effectively when growing in the shade of taller plants.
Some of Gause's experiments support Hutchinson's niche differentiation hypothesis.
Under any specific set of conditions-the same temperature, water availability, food source,
etc., Gause's principle holds true. But if conditions change, competition among species
may produce different winners and losers. Indeed, if waste products are periodically
removed, the outcome of the competition between P. aurelia and P. caudatum is reversed
and P. caudatum wins. Thus, in a complex environment where waste materials are
collected in some places and not in others, these two species could coexist.
Time is required for one species to competitively displace another, and the competitive
exclusion principle presumes that environmental conditions remain constant during that
time. In nature, however, environments change from season to season and from year to
year, so conditions that are favorable to a particular species may not persist and
environments that are constantly changing may allow competing species to coexist.

27.1: Origins of the Industrial Revolution
The Industrial Revolution, the wave of technological, economic, and social changes that
helped produce what we know as modern Europe, arose among back-country English
cottage craftspeople in the early 1700s and fundamentally restructured industry. First,
human hands were replaced by machines in the fashioning of finished products, rendering
the word manufacturing (made by hand technically obsolete). No longer would the weaver
sit at a handloom and painstakingly produce each piece of cloth. Instead, large
mechanical looms were invented to do the job faster and more economically. Second,
human power gave way to various forms of inanimate power. The machines were driven
by water power, the burning of fossil fuels, and later by hydroelectricity and the energy of
the atom. Men and women, once the proud producers of fine handmade goods, became
tenders of machines. Within a century and a half of its beginnings, this economic
revolution had greatly altered industrial activity.
The initial breakthrough came in the secondary, or manufacturing sector. More exactly, it
occurred in the British cotton textile industry, centered at that time in the district of
Lancashire in western England. At first, the changes were modest and on a small scale.
Mechanical looms were invented, and flowing water, long used as a source of power by
local grain millers, was harnessed to drive the looms. During this stage, manufacturing
industries remained largely rural, diffusing to sites where rushing streams could be found,
especially waterfalls and rapids. Later in the eighteenth century, the invention of the steam
engine provided a better source of power, and a shift away from water-powered machines
occurred. In the United States, too, the first factories were textile plants.
Metallurgy was also affected. Traditionally, metal industries had been small-scale, rural
enterprises, carried on in small forges (fireplaces where metals were heated and shaped)
situated near ore deposits. Forests provided charcoal for the smelting process in which
ores were melted and fused. The chemical changes that occurred in the making of steel
remained mysterious even to the people who made steel, and much ritual superstition
and ceremony were associated with steelmaking. Techniques had changed little in 2, 500
years. The Industrial Revolution radically altered all this. In the eighteenth century, a
series of inventions by iron makers allowed the old traditions, techniques, and rituals of
steelmaking to be swept away and replaced with scientific, large-scale industry. Coke,
nearly pure carbon derived from high-grade coal, was substituted for charcoal in the
smelting process. Large blast furnaces replaced the forge, and efficient rolling mills took
the place of hammers and anvils. Mass production of steel resulted, and the new industrial
order was built of steel. Other manufacturing industries made similar transitions and
entirely new types arose, such as machine-making.
Primary industries-those that gather or extract raw materials-were also revolutionized.
The first to feel the effects of the new technology was coal mining. The adoption of the
steam engine necessitated huge amounts of coal to fire the boilers and the conversion to
coke in the smelting process further increased the demand for coal. Fortunately, Great
Page 111 of 269
Britain had large coal deposits. New mining techniques and tools were invented so that
coal mining became a large-scale, mechanized activity. Coal, heavy and bulky, was
difficult to transport. As a result, manufacturing industries began flocking to the coalfields
in order to be near the supply. Similar modernization occurred in the mining of iron ore,
copper, and other metals needed by rapidly growing industries.
The Industrial Revolution also affected the tertiary(service) sector, most notably in the
form of rapid bulk transportation. The traditional wooden sailing ships gave way to steel
vessels driven by steam engines, canals were built, and the British-invented railroad
came on the scene. The principal stimulus that led to these transportation breakthroughs
was the need to move raw materials and finished products from one place to another,
both cheaply and quickly. The impact of the Industrial Revolution would have been
minimized had not the distribution of goods and services also been improved. It is no
accident that the British, creators of the Industrial Revolution, also invented the railroad,
initiated the first large-scale canal construction, and revolutionized the shipbuilding
industry.

27.2: The Heavy Bombardment and Life on Earth
It is estimated that Earth formed around 4.5 billion years ago, yet life-even the simplest
sort of microscopic life that must have started things off-did not begin right away. Until
about 3.9 billion years ago, Earth was subject to an intense barrage of large objects from
space, a time called the "heavy bombardment." Radiometric dating of Moon rocks shows
that most of the Moon's visible impact craters, or holes formed on its surface from impacts,
must have formed during this early period of the solar system's history. This is not
surprising: According to our modern theory of solar system formation, the planets were
built as larger and larger chunks of rock (sometimes mixed with metal or ice), or
planetesimals, collided with one another. When a colliding planetesimal stuck to a growing
planet, the planet got larger, increasing its gravity and allowing it to draw in even more
planetesimals. Even after the planets had reached essentially their current sizes, there
must still have been many planetesimals floating around; some of them still remain today,
as the objects we call asteroids and comets. Those planetesimals that had orbits
intersecting the orbits of the planets were doomed to eventual collisions, and most of
those collisions must have occurred early in the solar system's history, when the number
of planetesimals was still large. In other words, the heavy bombardment was the period
of time during which impacts were most common, and the evidence from the Moon tells
us that this period ended by about 3.9 billion years ago.
Some of the planetesimals were quite big. We have good reason to think that the Moon
itself was created when a planetesimal the size of the planet Mars struck the young Earth
within just 20 to 30 million years after Earth's formation. This "giant impact" is thought to
have blasted rock from Earth's outer layers into space, where some of it settled into
Earth's orbit and then was collected together by gravity to make the Moon.
Once the Moon formed, it became a record of the continuing impacts, not only telling us
when the heavy bombardment occurred but also telling us about the sizes of the impacting
objects from the sizes of the craters they left. Because human spaceflight missions visited
and brought back rocks from only six sites on the Moon, we have only incomplete data
about lunar cratering. Nevertheless, these data point to two key ideas: First, while there
were no more Mars-size impacts (fortunately!), the Moon continued to be pelted by
objects tens of miles to a couple of hundred miles across. Second, some of the largest
impacts occurred as the heavy bombardment was ending, marking what many scientists
now call the "late heavy bombardment." These large impacts created the smooth lunar
maria (large, flat surface areas), that you can see easily with a pair of binoculars.
Because the heavy bombardment was a phenomenon of the solar system, it cannot have
been unique to the Moon. This explains why we see craters on so many other planets'
arid moons. Earth, too, must have been frequently scarred by large impacts during the
heavy bombardment. In fact, Earth should have been hit even more than the Moon,
because our planet presents a bigger target and Earth's stronger gravity would have
drawn in more objects and accelerated them to higher speeds by the time they hit the
Page 113 of 269
ground. The only reason we do not see the craters from these impacts on Earth is that
they were erased long ago by volcanic eruptions, erosion, and other geological processes
that occur here but not on the Moon.
What does all this have to do with the origin of life? Calculations suggest that some of the
larger impacts would have had a devastating effect on life. For example, the impact of an
object larger than about 225 miles across would have released enough energy to
completely vaporize the oceans and raise the global temperature to more than 3,000F.
Such an impact probably would have sterilized our planet, wiping out any life that existed
when it occurred. Somewhat smaller impacts would have vaporized all but the deepest
ocean water, killing off any life that was not either living near the ocean bottom or in rock
deep underground. This means that life on Earth probably could not have begun until after
this stage.

28.1: Planetary Formation
According to the condensation theory of planet formation, planets form out of a spinning
disk of gas that surrounds a newborn star known as a protoplanetary disk. The disk and
star both originate in a rotating, collapsing cloud of material, and this process of collapse
produces different abundances of materials in the disk at different distances from the star.
In the higher temperature regions, comparable to the region around the planet Mercury
in our solar system, the only kinds of material that can condense from the gas to the solid
state (in this case, microscopic dust grains) are metals. Farther out, about where Venus,
Earth, and Mars are now, the gas temperatures are lower. At these distances and
temperatures, rocky materials such as silicates can also begin to form dust grains. Even
farther out, the temperature gets low enough for water ice to form, and even farther from
the star, ices of other compounds such as ammonia and methane can condense. But how
do young planetary systems go from making dust grains to making planets?
"The answer to that question," explains astronomer David Jewitt, "is a process called
binary accretion, where collisions between pairs of objects let larger and larger structures
get put together. " Collisions between grains, which are small and sticky, quickly lead to
the construction of pebbles. Collisions between pebbles lead to rocks. Collisions between
rocks lead to boulders. Collisions between boulders lead to planetesimals, rocky bodies
the size of asteroids (bodies that orbit between Mars and Jupiter and range in size up to
about 1,000 kilometers). If this accretion process happens far enough from the star,
significant quantities of ice will be included in the planetesimals. This is the likely origin of
comets. Eventually, the objects are large enough for gravity to begin compressing and
heating the planetesimal interiors. As planetesimals grow even larger, gravity pulls them
into a spherical shape, and the heaviest elements sink to the center of the body. Iron and
nickel will, in this way, form the dense metallic cores of the young planets. Eventually, fullsized terrestrial planets, the rocky cores of gas giants (such as Jupiter and Saturn), and
moons are formed through the accretion process.
The timescale for the accretion process depends on the density of gas and dust in the
protoplanetary disk, because higher densities mean more frequent collisions. In the inner
part of our pre-solar system disk, the density was high, and it took only 100 million years
to build the terrestrial planets. The formation of the outer planets is a more complicated
story, and scientists are still not sure how the gas and ice giants formed. "There are
basically two models for the formation of giant planets like Jupiter, " says Jewitt. In the
first model, an icy terrestrial planet grows by binary accretion up to a mass about 5-10
times that of Earth, at which point a new process begins. "When that small core planet
reaches the critical mass, "Jewitt explains, "it has enough gravity to start pulling in gas
from the surrounding disk. You get a very rapid flow of gas onto this core, taking the planet
all the way up to Jupiter's or Saturn's mass." This idea is called the core accretion model.
According to Jewitt among most solar system astronomers the core accretion model is
the preferred idea for the formation of the large gas planets Jupiter and Saturn. The
Page 115 of 269
problem with the core accretion theory for these particular planets is that building up the
rocky center takes an exceedingly long time. Near the end of the accretion phase, the
disk begins losing its gas content when radiation from the Sun causes it to disperse. If the
gas disperses before the core has a chance to reach its critical mass, the idea cannot
work. That is why astronomers have developed a second theory, called the hydrodynamic
instability model. This begins with an enormous disk of gas that collapses in on itself due
to the influence of its own gravity. Just as the star and its disk were formed from a
gravitationally unstable cloud, some astronomers claim that planets form from the
gravitational collapse of gas within the disk itself. "Parts of the disk would just contract
under their own gravity, " says Jewitt. The planets would form directly without needing a
core.

28.2: The Columbian Exchange
When Christopher Columbus and his men became the first Europeans to arrive in the
Americas in 1492, they set in motion a process of cultural, economic, and environmental
exchange that had profound effects on the whole world. For the "old," Afro-Eurasian world,
an important transformation included the addition of valuable new food items into the diets
of people in such widely separated regions as Ireland, China, and sub-Saharan Africa.
For the "new" American world, the most significant transformation involved the deadly
effects of Afro-Eurasian diseases among its peoples, which in turn, helped pave the way
for imperial conquest by Europeans. After two centuries of what is now known as the
Columbian Exchange, both Old and New Worlds were transformed.
About 12,000 years ago, the land bridge linking the Americas with Afro-Eurasia across
the Bering Strait disappeared as a result of rising sea levels. As a result, the people of the
Americas were almost completely separated from Old World people until the Spaniards
arrived in 1492. In other words, for twelve millennia, the people as well as the plants and
animals of the Americas developed in isolation from Afro-Eurasia according to the specific
environmental conditions of the Americas.
Some human developments were similar: for example, agriculture and writing developed
in the Americas just as they had done in Afro-Eurasia, as did the birth of hierarchical
societies and patriarchies -societies headed by the eldest male. In other ways, however,
developments in the Americas followed a different course from those of the Old World.
For example, plant species such as corn, potatoes, and tobacco were unique to the
Americas, and thus, American people had a different set of choices regarding possible
domesticated crops. Just as importantly, not long after humans arrived in the Americas,
all of the large mammals that existed there became extinct. As a result, when humans in
the Americas began to turn to settled agriculture, they did not have the choice to
domesticate large mammals such as cattle or horses. Because of this, American societies
did not develop innovations like the wheel, which proved unnecessary without large
animals to pull carts or push plows. Furthermore, other animals familiar across much of
Afro-Eurasia-including sheep, pigs, chickens, and goats-were nonexistent in the
Americas. In fact, the only animals that could be domesticated available to American
peoples were the dog, the turkey (in North America), the llama/alpaca and guinea pig (in
the Andes region of South America), and the Muscovy duck (in the South American
tropics).
The absence of animals that could be domesticated is critical because, in the Old World,
the domestication of animals such as sheep, chickens, goats, and cattle contributed
greatly to the development of serious diseases such as influenza, smallpox, measles, and
pertussis. In fact, many of these serious diseases resulted from microbes that were first
present in herds of domesticated animals and then made the jump from their animal hosts
to human hosts. The jump was made much easier because early Afro-Eurasian
communities that relied on domesticated animals for food and labor tended to live in close
Page 117 of 269
proximity to their herds- even keeping them inside their houses for protection or warmth.
Over time, a number of these microbial jumps occurred between domesticated animals
and humans. In addition, because of the land connections across much of Afro-Eurasian,
these diseases were able to spread to many Old World populations. While these diseases
continued to be serious for the peoples of Afro-Eurasia, the human populations that
survived them over the generations tended to pass on an acquired partial immunity to
their offspring.
Without many animals that could be domesticated and living in enforced separation from
Old World people, the people of the Americas remained freer from the type of contagious
diseases that so often plagued the Old World. Some contagious diseases did exist, to be
sure, and included dysentery, pneumonia, and possibly syphilis. But the “crowd” diseases
of the Old World that flourished in crowds of large, centralized populations of humans did
not exist, which meant that American people—when exposed to them—had no immunity
whatsoever. Therefore, when Europeans carrying these diseases inadvertently spread
them among American people, sickness spread rapidly, resulting in many deaths.

29.1: Echinoderm Evolution
The echinoderms are a phylum of invertebrate animals that includes starfish, sea urchins,
and sand dollars. One feature that distinguishes echinoderms from other groups of
organisms is their system of locomotion-the bottoms of echinoderms are covered with a
number of tiny tube feet, which aid the echinoderm in feeding and slow movement on the
ocean floor. Like other invertebrates, echinoderms lack a backbone and have a fairly
primitive nervous system. Unlike many invertebrates, the soft bodies of which are often
poorly preserved as fossils, echinoderms have hard internal skeletons made of calcite.
For this reason, echinoderms are well-represented in the fossil record. In spite of their
generally good preservation as fossils, there are several puzzles surrounding the
evolution of echinoderms.
One major mystery surrounding echinoderms is how they originated. The first clearly
recognizable echinoderms appeared around 540 million years ago during the Cambrian
period; however, these first echinoderms were already fairly complex. Paleontologists
have been unable to conclusively identify a simpler organism that could have been the
ancestor of the echinoderms. One fossil that has been tentatively suggested as an
ancestral echinoderm is Tribrachidium, which dates to the Ediacaran period, just before
the Cambrian. Tribrachidium is a round, flat, disc-shaped fossil that was discovered in
1959. Some paleontologists have suggested that Tribrachidium could have been a
primitive echinoderm, as it shares the radial body plan of modern echinoderms. A radial
body plan is one in which an organism's body is composed of parts that are arranged
symmetrically around the center, like the petals of a flower. Since most known
echinoderms have radial body plans, the radial symmetry of Tribrachidium has been
viewed as suggestive of an evolutionary relationship. However, Tribrachidium has now
been discounted as an ancestral echinoderm since it has triradial (three-point) symmetry
instead of the pentaradial (five-point) symmetry found in adult echinoderms. In 1985,
Tribrachidium was placed in its own phylum, Trilobozoa, a group with no known living
descendants.
Another puzzle related to echinoderm evolution is how and why these organisms acquired
their distinctive radial body plan. Among animals, all but the most primitive have bilateral
symmetry-the left sides of their bodies are roughly mirror images of the right sides. Two
main groups of animals have radial symmetry instead. One of these groups is jellyfish,
which are extremely primitive and are assumed never to have evolved bilateral symmetry.
The other radially symmetrical group is the echinoderms, which are fairly sophisticated.
In fact, biologists know that the echinoderms did once have bilateral symmetry because
the free-swimming larvae (young) of echinoderms are bilaterally symmetrical. Once the
larvae settle down on the ocean floor, they develop the radial symmetry of adult
echinoderms. It is not clear why echinoderms do not retain bilateral symmetry as adults.
Paleontologists are always attempting to determine evolutionary relationships among
organisms. One widely accepted hypothesis is that echinoderms are closely related to
Page 119 of 269
vertebrates-the group of animals that includes fish, reptiles, and mammals. Although adult
echinoderms do not resemble vertebrates, biologists have based this conclusion on DNA
comparisons and embryological evidence. In most non-echinoderm invertebrates, the
mouth forms from the first opening in the embryo (an early stage of development),
whereas in both echinoderm and vertebrate embryos, the mouth develops from a
secondary opening.
A group of animals called carpoids, which are only known through the fossil record, have
been considered to be intermediate between echinoderms and chordates, a group that
includes all vertebrates. Carpoids share several characteristics with vertebrates, including
gill slits and a complex nervous system. In fact, some experts have placed them near or
at the beginning of chordate evolution. However, carpoids possess a skeleton of calcite
plates identical to that of echinoderms. Calcite skeleton is not present in any chordates.
Furthermore, no ancestral genes for calcite skeleton development have been identified in
any present-day chordates, which indicates that chordates and echinoderms most likely
followed their own evolutionary paths and that carpoids are echinoderms. In 2012,
scientists reported the discovery in southern Europe of fossils from the early middle
Cambrian period; these fossils show adult echinoderms with a fully bilateral body plan.
The animals represented by these fossils may be the earliest echinoderms from which all
other echinoderms evolved.

29.2: Ancient Mapmaking
Claudius Ptolemy, who lived from approximately 85 to 168 AD, was an ancient mapmaker
whose works were rediscovered in Europe after being lost until the fifteenth century. He
lived in Alexandria, Egypt, where he used Alexandria's famous library to compile existing
knowledge of astronomy, geography, and astrology into three treatises. The astronomy
and geography treatises had a long-lasting influence, but they both presented serious
errors that went uncorrected for about 1,300 years. Ptolemy's astronomy treatise,
Almagest, rejected the theory earlier proposed by Aristarchus (approximately 230 BC)
that Earth revolves around the Sun. Ptolemy's geocentric idea-that Earth was the center
of the universe -accepted the ideas of Aristotle and formed the main thesis of his treatise.
When Ptolemy's works resurfaced in the fifteenth century, they were accepted as gems
of ancient wisdom, and few had the nerve or the authority to challenge them. Likewise,
any sixteenth-century maps that altered the Ptolemy map were regarded with suspicion.
In his other influential treatise, Geographia, Ptolemy rejected the nearly correct
computation of the distance around Earth-Earth's circumference-made by Eratosthenes
in approximately 240 BC. Rather, he chose an erroneous and much smaller distance
(about 75 percent of the actual size). Ptolemy did not make any measurements himself,
as Eratosthenes had done, but selectively compiled other information that was known at
the time. The estimate he chose came from the Greek astronomer Poseidonius.
Subsequently, however, his choices became known as Ptolemaic ideas and were
considered irrefutable. Also, Ptolemy assumed that the known world's land surface
covered 180 degrees of longitude, ranging from the Canary Islands in the west to the
easternmost part of Asia (about 20 degrees of longitude). This error on his map showed
the Atlantic Ocean much too narrow and connecting Western Europe and East Asia
without the American continents in between. This remained the understanding of the
world for 1,300 years.
The combination of these two errors -Earth's circumference too small and land area too
large- encouraged mariners of the fifteenth century to assume that a relatively short
voyage across the Atlantic Ocean would take them to Asia. Columbus was the first to
promote an expedition on the basis of these errors. When Columbus reached land, he
had traveled as far as he expected to travel to reach Asia and logically assumed that he
had succeeded.
To his credit, Ptolemy's map introduced some excellent standards to mapmaking, despite
the errors. Though he was not the first to use the idea of a gridded coordinate system, his
method of showing attitude and longitude became a standard for future maps. Also,
Ptolemy insisted that maps should be drawn to scale. Many maps of his time were
distorted by enlarging the better-known places in order to include all the known
information. Unfortunately, many mapmakers of his time failed to adopt his practical
approach to scale and location.
Page 121 of 269
Maps began to proliferate in the sixteenth century. Each voyage of exploration and
discovery provided new information that had to be mapped. In 1507, a German
mapmaker, Martin Waldseemoler, produced a map of the world, Universalis
Cosmographia, which was the first to show Columbus's discovery as a separate
continent. But he cautiously made the new continent very narrow-just a long, skinny island
-rather than contradict Ptolemy's erroneous circumference of Earth. By the middle of the
sixteenth century, enough voyages had been made, including Magelan's trip around the
world, that most mapmakers recognized that Earth's circumference, as shown on
Ptolemy's map, was wrong.
In 1569, the Flemish mapmaker, Gerardus Mercator, made a map of the world showing
all the known lands using his now famous innovative grid system of latitude and longitude.
In 1570, Abraham Ortelus, a Belgian mapmaker, made the first known atlas of the world
in an effort to compile rapidly accumulating geographic knowledge. Although these maps
still had some remaining traits of the Ptolemy map, they showed great improvements in
detail and accuracy. A major feature retained from the Ptolemy map was the presence of
a very large continent in the Antarctic-large enough to counterbalance the weight of the
Northern Hemisphere land. This belief was based on the Greek concept of symmetry, as
well as the idea that the Earth needed to be balanced to turn smoothly.

30.1: The Difference Threshold and Signal-detection Theory
How much weight must be added to or subtracted from a stack of books for the carrier to
sense that the load is heavier or lighter? The just-noticeable difference (JND) is the
smallest change in sensation that a person is able to detect 50 percent of the time. The
difference threshold is a measure of the smallest increase or decrease in a physical
stimulus that is required to produce the JND. A person holding a 5-pound load would
notice the addition of a single pound, but a person already holding 100 pounds would not
be able to sense an additional pound. More than 150 years ago, researcher Ernst Weber
(1795-1878) observed that the JND for all the senses depends on a proportion or percent
of change rather than a fixed amount of change. This observation became known as
Weber's law. A weight being held must increase or decrease by 2 percent for the
difference to be noticed. According to Weber's law, the greater the original stimulus, the
more it must be increased or decreased for the difference to be noticeable.
The difference threshold is not the same for all the senses. A very large (20 percent)
difference is necessary for some changes in taste to be detected, for instance. In contrast,
a difference is noticeable if a musical tone becomes slightly higher or lower in pitch by
only about 0.33 percent. Nor are the difference thresholds for the various senses the
same for all people. In fact, there are great individual differences, often arising from
experience or expertise. Professional food tasters know if a particular item or batch is a
little too sweet, even if its sweetness varies by only a fraction of the 20 percent usually
necessary to detect changes in taste. Furthermore, people who have lost one sensory
ability often gain greater sensitivity to the other sensory abilities. Actually, Weber's law
best fits people with average sensitivities and sensory stimuli that are neither very strong
nor very weak, for example, not as loud as thunder or as quiet as a faint whisper.
The classic methods in psychophysics for measuring difference thresholds focus
exclusively on the physical stimulus-how strong or weak it is or how much the stimulus
must change for the difference to be noticed. But even within the same individual, sensory
capabilities are sharper and duller from time to time and under different conditions.
Factors that affect a person's ability to detect a sensory signal are, in addition to the
strength of the stimulus, the motivation to detect it, previous experience, an expectation
that it will occur, and alertness or level of fatigue.
In another approach, these factors are taken into account. According to signal-detection
theory, the detection of a sensory stimulus involves discriminating that stimulus from
background noise (all the other stimuli present in the environment) and deciding whether
the stimulus is actually present. But deciding that a stimulus is present in the first place
depends partly on the probability that the stimulus will occur and partly on the potential
gain or loss associated with deciding that it is present or absent. Suppose you were given
the description of a cousin you had never seen before and were asked to pick her up at
the airport. Your task would be to scan a sea of faces for someone fitting the description
and then to decide which of the several people who fit the description was actually your
Page 123 of 269
cousin. All the other faces and objects in your field of vision would be considered
background noise. How sure you would have to be before you approached someone
would depend on several factors-among them, the embarrassment you might feel
approaching the wrong person as opposed to the distress you would feel if you failed to
find your cousin.
Signal-detection theory has special relevance to people in many occupations: air-traffic
controllers, police officers, military personnel on guard duty, medical professionals, and
poultry inspectors, to name a few. Whether these professionals detect certain stimuli can
have important consequences for the health and welfare of vast numbers of people.

30.2: Bird Songs and Calls
Birds use song both in courtship and to define areas of territory. Both of these are
communicative purposes: the bird is passing specific messages to other members of its
species. Birds communicate for other reasons as well: a blackbird, for instance, will make
a sharp "pink-pink" sound when there is a cat nearby, which warns other birds in the
neighborhood of the danger.
William Thorpe (1961) studied the behavior of gannets in a colony containing many
thousands of birds. Thorpe found that when a bird was returning to its nest, it would drift
on an updraft of air from the bottom of the cliff upwards, calling as it went. When the bird
on the nest heard its mate calling, it would call in reply, showing that each bird's call could
act as an identification signal. Thorpe also calculated that a bird might have as many as
fifteen or sixteen different kinds of calls, each serving a different function.
J. R. Krebs (1976) investigated how birds seem to sing more intensively in the early
morning--”the dawn chorus.” By investigating what the birds actually did during each day
and how much time they spent on each activity, Krebs found that the dawn chorus serves
a largely territorial function. The early morning is not a particularly good time for gathering
food, because it is dark, so visibility is lower, and it is also cold, so many insects are still
inactive. On the other hand, at this time, many birds move around looking for living space,
so establishing and defending a territory is necessary. Birdsong is not just territorial, of
course. A bird's song can serve a dual purpose: it can be used to defend a territory, and
by indicating to a prospective mate that the singer has a territory to defend, it can also
attract a female bird.
P. J. B. Slater (1981) suggested that bird calls and birdsong are partly learned from other
birds. He found that chaffinches which had been hand-reared and had not heard other
wild birds made an entirely different kind of “chink" call from that of wild birds. In one case,
Slater observed a laboratory chaffinch in a duet with a wild sparrow outside the window
of the laboratory. The chaffinch imitated the sparrow's "cheep" whenever the sparrow
produced it. Slater concluded that learning through copying is an important part of the
way in which birds acquire their songs. Slater also found that individual chaffinches can
have up to five different types of songs. Some of these are personal, sung by that bird
alone. Others are shared by several birds. In some cases, too, Slater observed
chaffinches singing songs which were almost identical to those sung by others, but with
just a note or two different-possibly because the bird had made an error in copying the
song from another.
Slater studied a population of 40 chaffinches on the Orkney Islands and found that among
them, they had seventeen different song types. So it was not a matter of each bird having
its own individual songs--there was a considerable amount of sharing. Slater found that
this sharing related to geographical distribution, but that the boundaries were not distinct
enough for it to be accurately described as a dialect or regional variety of a song. Instead,
Page 125 of 269
there was considerable overlap between the songs sung in one area and those sung in
an adjoining one, but gradually the overlap would become less, until birds a long distance
away from one another would be singing entirely different songs.
In 1970, Peter Marler proposed that birdsong and speech were directly comparable in
certain key respects and that the study of birdsong might provide psychologists with some
useful indicators as to the nature and development of speech in human beings. One of
the parallels which Marler identified was the way that both humans and birds show a
strong genetic predisposition to pick up and imitate certain sounds rather than others.
Marler showed that young birds will learn the songs of their own species if they are played
to them when young, but they will ignore the songs of birds from other species. Similarly,
young human beings are surrounded by all kinds of sounds and noises, but it is the human
voice to which they listen most closely and human speech which they imitate.

31.1: Mass Production under China's First Emperor
Attempts to optimize the function, value, and appearance of mass-produced goods-goals
associated with modern industrial design-date to as early as China's first emperor, Qin
Shi Huang, who harnessed the power of design and mass production in the name of
conquest. He is remembered for unifying by force China's warring states in 221 B.C. into
the most powerful country the world had ever seen. He was also responsible for building
the Great Wall of China to protect his new nation's borders from raiding Mongolian
invaders. He is even better known, certainly in archaeological circles, for the Terracotta
Army that was made to honor him and to protect him in the afterlife. This collection of
ceramic funeral sculptures depicting the emperor's army is estimated to have included
8,000 life-sized statues of soldiers and 670 horses, as well as depictions of other
members of his vast following, from officials and servants to musicians, singers, and
acrobats. Although this army should probably be considered collections of statues rather
than expressions of manufacturing design, the figures were essentially factory-pro, using
systemized methods of production similar to those used to make serially manufactured
functional objects. The figures were also buried with weapons, and around 40,000 bronze
spears, swords, crossbows, halberds, and staffs have been recovered by archaeologists
so far.
As with the manufacture of the terracotta warriors themselves, the production of their
accompanying weapons reveals that Emperor Qin's workforce was organized into highly
efficient production teams that used standardization measures and quality-control
procedures. The technical knowledge of these Chinese weapon-makers, however, was
not confined to equipping the Terracotta Army with weapons, far from it. Recent research
has revealed that some of the burial material was actually used in battle and bears the
scars to prove it. Emperor Qin's craft workers perfected the art of bronze-making to such
an extent that they were able to produce swords that are now considered some of the
finest bronze weapons ever made. Because their raw material was of such a high grade,
the emperor's craft workers could manufacture swords that were significantly longer than
any that had gone before, which gave Qin's soldiers the enormous benefit of 30 percent
greater reach and cutting power. Thus, the development of better-quality materials
enabled the production of better-performing designs, which gave the first Chinese
emperor's forces a decisive advantage; this is a recurring theme throughout the story of
design-as more advanced materials are invented or discovered, their unique benefits are
employed by designers to improve existing designs, thereby creating superior products.
Another reason that Qin was able to achieve his epic conquest of the warring states was
that his workers produced weaponry to such precise specifications that their parts were
completely interchangeable. If, for example, a section of a crossbow broke in battle, it
could be replaced easily with an exactly replicated piece. Similarly, the arrows used by
his soldiers had interchangeable shafts so that their arrowheads could be reused even if
the shaft had broken. A high degree of manufacturing efficiency and standardization was
bolstered by a culture of manufacturing accountability, with workers' output overseen by
Page 127 of 269
supervisors to ensure that no defective workmanship was ever allowed to creep into the
production system-and if it did, the consequences were severe. Precision manufacturing
and an exacting quality-control system were used not only for weaponry but also for
weights and measures during Qin's reign, and this system of standardized production
formed the basis upon which Chinese design and manufacturing would flourish over the
succeeding centuries.
Over the next thousand years, Chinese craft workers used methods similar to these to
design and manufacture ceramics and bronze wares that were technically far superior to
their European equivalents. The delicate blue-and-white porcelain crockery imported from
China into Europe in increasing quantities during the 1700s must have seemed the finest
example of refinement and modernity when compared to the heavy and rather primitive
earthenware pottery produced in Europe. A capacity for the precise replication of designs
is still a defining characteristic of Chinese production, and it can surely be traced back to
the first emperor's innovative implementation of rigorous design standards, which became
incorporated into the nation's manufacturing culture.

31.2: Changes in the Art Market During the Late Nineteenth Century
Today's market for European art has its roots in the nineteenth century. In 1882, the
passage of the Settled Land Act reformed inheritance law in Britain. As a consequence of
industrialization and the availability in Europe of large quantities of cheap American
wheat, the fortunes of British landowners were in decline. After bankruptcies began to
mount, the inheritance laws were changed, making it possible for landowners to support
their landholdings by selling their art treasures. Until 1882, estates were strictly settled,
meaning that the head of the family did not actually own the land and estate goods, but
rather was entrusted to preserve and protect the family property. This was meant to hinder
large estates from being sold off in sections. The Settled Land Act made it possible to sell
individual portions of an estate, such as works of art, in order to save the real estate (land
and buildings). The art treasures of the British nobility began to flow into London auction
houses, shoring up their dominant position in the art market.
Besides the passage of this law, the early 1880s marked the public acknowledgment of
French Impressionism, a revolutionary art movement that emphasized subjects from
everyday life and the accurate depiction of light and its changing qualities. Prior to this,
Impressionist artists had been regarded as radical, immoral individuals who had declared
war on beauty. Impressionist paintings were not accepted by the Salon de L'Academie
des Beaux-Arts in Paris, which had been, since 1830, the most important exhibition forum
in the world and was historically the guardian of traditional standards of French painting.
In reaction to the conservative tendencies of this institution, a group of Impressionist
artists in Paris organized their own exhibition in 1874. Reviews of the exhibition were
mixed. But in 1881, the Impressionist painter Edouard Manet was named a knight of the
Legion of Honor; in 1882, Paul Cezanne was allowed to exhibit his work for the first time
at the Salon.
With the advent of Impressionism, the modern art market was born. Since most collectors
rejected the Impressionists, especially early on, the usual paths for distribution were
closed to these artists, and they had to find other ways to sell their pictures. The rejection,
however, meant that the artists were not dependent on the tastes of potential patrons
(wealthy supporters), and hence, they began to see themselves as autonomous masters.
This new approach also awakened a newfound respect for the art dealer, since the dealer
had access to artistic genius and could open up the path to new art and explain it to
potential buyers. In the early twentieth century, the Cubist style (abstract art based on
geometric forms) arose, and representational art- art that represented objects and people
realistically- became less significant. This development also strengthened the notion of
the artist’s genius, as well as that of the art dealer as a go-between. On the one hand, the
content of art became more complex, and on the other, it also became more difficult to
understand and communicate.
Of course, artworks by the so-called old masters continued to be sold. The most
successful dealer of such art was probably Joseph Duveen, who arrived in New York City
Page 129 of 269
at the age of seventeen in 1886. After a brief apprenticeship under his uncle, the art dealer
Henry Duveen, Joseph opened a gallery (a privately owned establishment for displaying
and selling artwork) in proximity to the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, which was already the
meeting place for the city's elite. Duveen's business strategy entailed the purchase of
complete art collections from their owners. In this way, a buyer would be unable to
calculate Duveen's wholesale price for an individual artwork and hence, the percentage
that he kept for himself. If he made purchases at auctions where the price he paid would
be public knowledge, he did not shrink from paying record prices, since this practice
brought him a reputation and also raised the value of the pieces already in his inventory.
He also stirred up enthusiasm for collecting among many American industrialists; these
millionaires regarded the acquisition of European masterpieces as an opportunity to
ensure the immortality of their names.

32.1: Ocean and Atmosphere on Early Earth
Where did Earth's ocean water come from? Scientists agree that a large amount of water
must have arrived during planet accretion, which is the process of collision and sticking
together of the material in orbit around the Sun by which Earth and the other planets in
the solar system formed 4.6 billion years ago. Perhaps significant volumes were added
during the period of heavy bombardment, during which Earth was being hit by a large
number of comets (whose nuclei are composed mostly of ice) and other objects left over
from the formation of the planets. The volume of water eventually found on Earth may be
related to the formation of Earth's core (innermost layer). When the iron- and nickel-rich
core formed, most of the water in the forming planet was consumed in oxidation
processes whereby the oxygen component of water was used to make iron and nickel
oxides. It is the residual water that makes up the oceans. Perhaps that residual quantity
was significantly enhanced by water carried by comets after Earth's initial formation,
perhaps not. In either case, the oceans reached approximately their present volume 3.8
billion years ago. But this does not mean they were in their present area. Geologist Don
Lowe has estimated that before 3 billion years ago, less than 5 percent of Earth's surface
was land. Earth's atmosphere was also very different from that of today. There was no
oxygen, and there was a great more carbon dioxide (Co2)—perhaps 100 to 1,000 times
as much as today.
Earth's surface temperature was higher than it is now because more heat was emanating
from the interior and because of the warming generated by the extensive CO2 and other
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases trap heat near the surface
through the so-called greenhouse effect. Earth's internal generation of heat was an
important factor; the Sun at this time was much fainter, delivering perhaps a third less
energy than at the present time.
What would have happened if Earth had stayed a water world? Probably global
temperatures would have remained high or even increased. For animal life to form, the
temperature had to drop from the levels acknowledged to have been characteristic of
Archaean time (about 4 to 2.5 billion years ago). A drop in global temperature while the
Sun was getting hotter required a drastic reduction of atmospheric CO2--a reduction of
the greenhouse effect. Thus, there had to be some means of removing CO2. The most
effective way to do this is through the formation of limestone, which uses CO2 as one of
its building blocks and thus removes it from the atmosphere. But significant volumes of
limestone form today only in shallow water; the most effective limestone formation occurs
in a depth of less than 20 feet (6 meters). In deeper water, high concentrations of
dissolved CO2 slow or inhibit the chemical reactions that lead to limestone formation.
There is evidence of deep-water, inorganic limestone formation in very old rocks on Earth,
as demonstrated by geologist Jo. Grominger and his team. These studies show that early
Earth's ocean may have been saturated in the compounds that can produce limestone
and thus could have formed solid limestone in deeper water at that time, removing carbon
dioxide from the atmosphere as a consequence. However, Grominger points out that
Page 131 of 269
occurrences of carbonate rocks such as limestone during the early Archaean--roughly the
first billion years of Earth's existence—are rare. And this is only partly due to the rarity of
rocks of this age. It looks as though the central mode of removing carbon dioxide from
the atmosphere-the formation of carbonate rocks—seldom occurred.
To form limestone in significant volumes, then, shallow water is needed, but on a planet
without continents, shallow water is in short supply. On Earth, from perhaps 2.7 to 2.5
billion years ago, there occurred a rapid buildup of continental areas, resulting in an
increase in the land surface from perhaps 5 percent to about 30 percent. Larger
continents meant larger shallow-water regions, for the emergence of continents created
shallow areas near the continents as well as large inland seas and lakes.

32.2: Zebra Stripes
Zebras, horse-like animals native to the grasslands of Africa, are known for their
distinctive black and white stripes. Historically many scientists thought zebras' stripes
served to camouflage (hide) them from predators, such as lions and hyenas. This
assumption was based on the observation that other animals, such as tigers, have similar
stripes that make them less visible. However, in recent years, scientists have noted that
zebras' environment and behavior are not well suited to camouflage by stripes. Tigers
often inhabit heavily-forested areas in which their vertical stripes help them blend in with
the surrounding trees, but zebras typically inhabit open grasslands. Unlike tigers, who
use stealth to stalk their prey, zebras are herbivores that rarely hold still when threatened
by predators; instead, they rely on their good eyesight to spot predators at a distance and
flee at any signal of danger.
A zebra's stripes may help to protect it in other ways. Stripes may help zebras blend in
with each other, rather than blend in with their environment. Zebras live in large herds,
and they flee as a group when threatened. The dense pattern of moving zebra stripes
may appear as a mass of confusing images, making it difficult for predators to target
individual zebras. Catching a fleeing zebra requires a precisely timed final leap, and a
zebra's stripes may interfere with predators' perception of distance. Because zebras have
some ability to defend themselves by using their hind legs to kick at pursuing predators,
at times powerfully enough to cause serious injury, a zebra's distinctive stripes may also
serve as a Warning that encourages predators to seek less dangerous prey. However,
none of these explanations is strongly supported by observation. Zebras are killed by
lions about as frequently as other unstriped prey animals.
More recently, scientists have suggested that the primary purpose of stripes is to protect
zebras from biting flies. The grasslands of Africa are home to a number of species of flies
that feed on the blood of large mammals and can cause considerable damage through
blood loss and the transmission of diseases. Laboratory tests have shown that biting flies
are less likely to land on objects covered in black and white stripes than on solid black on
white surfaces. It is not yet known why biting flies would avoid striped objects, but
scientists have suggested that the explanation lies in the mechanisms of flies' vision,
which is simple and apparently confused by stripes. The stripes may make it difficult for
flies to detect the outline of a zebra's body or cause the flies to confuse a zebra for a
collection of thin, vertical objects that do not resemble potential victims. Scientists have
analyzed the stomach contents of wild biting flies and have found relatively little zebra
blood.
If stripes are an effective means of protection against biting flies, then why have other
animals not evolved stripes as well? One theory is that zebras are particularly vulnerable
to flies because of their unusually short hair and developed stripes as an alternative
protective measure. Horses, which are closely related to zebras, are indeed extremely
susceptible to biting flies when imported to Africa. They are frequently infected by fly-
Page 133 of 269
borne parasitic infections, which are often fatal even when veterinary treatment is
provided. Horses do not develop immunity to the parasites and so can be repeatedly reinfected.
Other puzzles remain. For instance, biting flies seem to be most discouraged by
horizontal stripes, but the stripes on zebras are mostly vertical. More mysteriously, not all
zebras are covered in stripes: the quagga, an extinct subspecies of zebra, had fainter
stripes that were present only on the front half of its body. If stripes protect from flies, why
would the quagga lack protection on half of its body? This cannot be explained by
environmental factors, because quaggas' range overlapped with that of fully striped
zebras. One possible explanation is that if they only have stripes on half of their body,
quaggas can more easily distinguish between their own and other species of zebra,
making it easier for them to follow the solid-colored hindquarters when fleeing from
predators. This behavioral hypothesis is unfortunately impossible to test, because
scientists can only study the quagga through preserved museum specimens and a
handful of nineteenth-century photographs.

33.1: The Behavior of Magma
Why do some volcanoes explode violently while others erupt gently? Why do some kinds
of magma (molten rock) solidify within Earth to form hard rocks, and others rise all the
way to the surface to erupt from volcanoes as lava? To answer these questions, we must
consider the properties and behavior of magma. Once magma forms, it rises toward
Earth's surface because it is less dense than surrounding rock. As it rises, two changes
occur. First, it cools as it enters shallower and cooler levels of Earth. Second, pressure
drops because the weight of the overlying rock decreases. Cooling and decreasing
pressure have opposite effects on magma: Cooling tends to solidify it, but decreasing
pressure tends to keep it liquid.
Whether magma solidifies or remains liquid as it rises toward Earth's surface depends on
the type of magma. Basaltic magma commonly rises to the surface to erupt from a
volcano. In contrast, granitic magma usually solidifies within Earth's crust (outer layer).
Granitic magma contains about 70 percent silica, whereas the silica content of basaltic
magma is only about 50 percent. In addition, granitic magma generally contains up to 10
percent water, whereas basaltic magma contains only 1 to 2 percent water.
As in silicate minerals, silicate tetrahedral (four-faced solids, similar to triangular
pyramids) in magma link together to form chains, sheets, and framework structures. They
form long chains if silica is abundant in the magma but shorter chains if less silica is
present. Because of its higher silica content, granitic magma contains longer chains than
basaltic magma. In granitic magma, the long chains become tangled, making the magma
stiff or viscous. It rises slowly because of its viscosity and has ample time to solidify within
the crust before reaching the surface. In contrast, basaltic magma, with its shorter silicate
chains, is less viscous and flows easily. Because of its fluidity, it rises rapidly to erupt at
Earth's surface.
A second difference is that granitic magma contains more water than basaltic magma.
Water lowers the temperature at which magma solidifies. Thus, if dry granitic magma
solidifies at 700C, magma with 10 percent water may remain liquid until its temperature
drops below 600C. Water tends to escape as steam from hot magma, but deep in Earth's
crust, where granitic magma forms, high pressure prevents the water from escaping. As
magma rises, pressure decreases, and Water escapes. Because the magma loses water,
its solidification temperature rises, causing it to become hard rock. Thus, water loss
causes rising granitic magma to solidify within the crust. For this reason, most granitic
magmas solidify at depths of 5 to 20 kilometers beneath the Earth's surface. Because
basaltic magmas have only 1 to 2 percent water to begin with, water loss is relatively
unimportant. As a result of its comparatively low viscosity, rapidly rising basaltic magma
remains liquid on the way to the Earth's surface, and basal volcanoes are common.
In most cases, granitic magma solidifies within Earth's crust to form a rocky mass called
a pluton. Many granite plutons are large, measuring tens of kilometers in diameter. To
Page 135 of 269
form a large pluton, a huge volume of granitic magma must rise through the continental
crust. But how can such a large mass of magma rise through solid rock? If you place oil
and water in a jar, screw the lid on, and shake the jar, oil droplets disperse throughout the
water. When you set the jar down, the droplets coalesce to form larger bubbles, which
rise toward the surface, easily displacing the water as they ascend. Granitic magma rises
in a similar way. It forms near the base of the continental crust, where surrounding rock
is soft and flexible and behaves plastically. It flows and deforms without fracturing
because it is hot. As the magma rises, it shoulders aside the hot, plastic rock, which then
slowly flows back to fill in behind the rising bubble. After a pluton forms, forces in the crust
may push it upward, and erosion may expose parts of it at Earth's surface.

33.2: Transport of Food to Rome
During the reign of Emperor Augustus (63 B.C-14 A.D.), the city of ancient Rome may
have had as many as 1,200,000 inhabitants. With so many residents, the city needed an
extremely large food supply, necessitating the development of an improved system for
shipping food. Transportation of bulk goods by land was prohibitively expensive and slow.
It simply was not practical to haul a wagonload of wheat very far, for example, since the
animals needed to pull the wagon would quickly eat an amount of food equal to the
relatively limited amount that could be carried in the wagon itself. The solution to this
problem was to move goods by sea. Scholars have estimated that the cost of shipping
grain from one end of the Mediterranean to the other was cheaper than hauling the same
amount of grain 120 kilometers overland. It was perhaps 40 times more expensive to
transport goods by land rather than by sea, and while it was somewhat more costly to
move goods along a river than over the open ocean, river transport was still many times
more efficient than land transport.
Since Italian resources were not sufficient to feed Rome, Romans naturally looked to the
Roman-controlled areas that were closest to Rome, and that had access to the sea. The
first provinces that had surplus grain collected from them and transported to the city of
Rome in large quantities were, logically enough, the nearby islands of Sicily and Sardinia.
Once Rome had conquered the coast of North Africa, the foods from this region were
rounded up and routed toward the city of Rome as well. By the first century A.D., Egypt
and the coastal areas of Spain and Gaul had been added to this list. Despite its distance
from Rome, Egypt, in particular, was an important source of grain. The safe arrival of the
Egyptian grain fleet off the Coast of Italy was a major cause for celebration.
While necessary as the only practical way to transport enough food to Rome, this maritime
traffic could also be problematic. Particularly during the winter, the Mediterranean Sea
can produce violent storms that would have sunk ancient ships. Thus, the prime sailing
season was restricted to only three or four months during the summer since most of the
supplies for the city had to reach Rome's ports during this narrow window of opportunity
or else face greatly multiplied chances of being caught in a storm and sinking. Natural
dangers were not the only threat to shipping, however. Piracy in the ancient
Mediterranean was rampant, and despite sporadic attempts at suppression, pirates had
nearly free reign to prey upon merchant ships. The Romans were aware of challenges
that had to be overcome to keep the city fed. The Roman historian Tacitus commented,
"Italy relies upon external supplies, and the life of the Roman people is daily at the
uncertain mercies of sea and storm" (Annals 3.54). The scale of the food and other
supplies pouring into Rome demanded an appropriate infrastructure, both administrative
and physical.
Rome is not located directly on the Mediterranean Sea but is about 22 kilometers inland
on the Tiber River. The mouth of the Tiber lacked a natural harbor where ships could be
safely unloaded. The smallest ships could have traveled upriver directly to Rome, but
Page 137 of 269
medium or large freighters had to be off-loaded somewhere else. During the republic (509
to about 29 B.C.), many ships (including the huge Egyptian grain freighters) docked at
the good harbor at Puteoli on the Bay of Naples. From here, their cargo had to be either
shifted to smaller watercraft for their trip to Rome or else hauled overland. At the mouth
of the Tiber was located the port city of Ostia. The harbor facilities at Ostia remained
rudimentary through the republic, and larger ships that docked there simply had to anchor
offshore and have their cargo transferred onto barges or small craft for the trip upriver. As
Rome continued to grow and traffic increased, these harbor arrangements were clearly
unacceptable, and in A.D. 42, the emperor Claudius tackled this problem and began to
construct substantial harbor works at Ostia. Just north of the city, he excavated out of the
coastline an artificial harbor known as Portus, although it was not a wholly successful
project. Rome at last got a first-rate harbor when the emperor Trajan rebuilt Portus and
added an inner harbor where ships could be completely safe.

34.1: Water and Life on Mars
The question of life on Mars depends heavily on the characteristics of its air and water.
Mars has a relatively thin and dry atmosphere, with a high percentage of carbon dioxide
compared to Earth's atmosphere. Mars tilts about 25°, which leads to seasons like those
on Earth. Carbon dioxide freezes into the polar caps during the winter and evaporates
into the air in the summer. This causes a fluctuation in the density of the atmosphere of
up to 25 percent over the year; with so little atmosphere, the planet experiences a wide
range of temperatures, heating up during the day and rapidly cooling at night.
Temperatures on Mars have been measured between 225 F and 95°.
Scientists remain fascinated by the possibility of liquid water on Mars. Life as we know it
requires water, so it should be a good marker for habitability. Current conditions on Mars
suggest that liquid water could not occur on the surface. The low pressure and low
temperature mean that ice would sublime-go straight from solid to gas-rather than melt.
Water may be hiding in subsurface reservoirs, however, and stream forth for limited
periods. In 2002, the Mars Odyssey orbiter detected large quantities of water ice near the
surface of the southern hemisphere. Channels on the surface suggest the presence of
moving water in large quantities. In 2006, Mars Global Surveyor provided pictures of
gullies (channels) on the surface that could only have been produced by liquid water
flowing within the past seven years. Theories exist for how climate and erosion may reveal
underground ice and cause sudden floods, but specific details are still a mystery. The
water probably represents flash floods that quickly evaporate and may not provide an
adequate medium for the development of life. If life arose in the distant past, though, the
surface floods may have been enough to maintain organisms adapted to such
environments.
Astrobiologists continue to investigate whether the current situation-frozen water with
occasional flash floods-was always the situation on Mars. Some surface channels on
Mars could not have been produced by flash floods or geologic activity. The Opportunity
rover, which landed on Mars in 2004, made two interesting discoveries in several craters
on Mars. Rock layers on the sides of the craters look like the patterns inside sedimentary
rocks on Earth. Sedimentary rocks form gradually at the bottom of bodies of water as
particles settle down to the bottom. Sedimentary rocks on Mars would imply that a body
of water was present for hundreds of years at some point in the past. In addition,
Opportunity has found countless tiny spheres of the mineral hematite (a mineral
composed of iron and oxygen) on the surface. These tiny spheres, or "blueberries" as
they have come to be called, strongly resemble accretions ( accumulations) found on
Earth in highly acidic stream beds. Together with rippling patterns in the stone of the
surface, the layers and blueberries make a compelling argument. Acidic, salty, flowing
water must once have covered large regions of the plain where Opportunity landed. The
Sun has been very slowly cooling off for the past few billion of years. A warmer Sun in the
past means a warmer Mars. Planetary scientists do not think the difference was enough
to bring Mars up to Earth-like temperatures, but it may have been enough to support liquid
Page 139 of 269
water in the warmer regions of the planet.
Overall, Mars looks like a good candidate for past life. Water, carbon, and energy were
all present in useful amounts. If life arises quickly wherever resources allow, then Mars
probably had life once. Unfortunately, we have no way to assess how common the origin
of life might be. This is one of the questions scientists were asking when they explored
Mars in the first place.
Another important question to ask in the exploration of Mars has to disagree about
evidence for life in the first billion years of Earth's history. Mars' history must be even more
contentious. The most unambiguous evidence of life on Earth comes in the form of
structural fossils, which probably did not start forming on Earth until life had been around
for at least a billion years. If life did arise on Mars, it may not have been around long
enough to leave that kind of evidence.

34.2: Jomon Pottery
The oldest known pottery in the world comes from Japan, and is known as Jomon, which
means "cord marks", after its typical decorations made by impressing cords into the wet
clay. The earliest Jomon pottery is dated to around 14,000 B.C., considerably earlier than
any pottery produced in Europe and western Asia, the earliest of which dates to
approximately 8,000 B.C.
Why should the Jomon people have been so inventive? Why were they making pottery
so much earlier than anywhere else in the world? Only pottery from China comes remotely
close to it in date, and there it is explained by the requirements of rice cultivation. Melvin
Aikens, an authority on the Jomon period, believes that Japanese pottery was invented
to cook and store the produce of the thick broad-leaved woodlands that had already
covered Kyushu, Japan's southernmost main island, by 13,000 B.C. The relationship is
evident, he argues, from the simultaneous spread of broad-leaved woodlands and pottery
into the northern islands of Japan, both appearing on the northernmost island of Hokkaido
at around 7,000 B.C.
There are ,however, two problems with this idea. First, there is no necessity for huntergatherers to have pottery when living in wooded environments-the inhabitants of other
villages of this era, such as Ain Mallaha in western Asia at 12,500 B.C. and Star Carr in
northern Europe at 9, 500 B.C., flourished by relying entirely on vessels made from bark,
skins, wood, and stone. Pottery no doubt made life easier for those who did the cooking
in the woodlands of Kyushu, and we know from food residues that pottery vessels had
indeed been used to make vegetable, meat, and fish stews, but people could have easily
survived without such vessels.
A second problem for Aikens' theory arose in 1999, when a new sample of pottery was
found in northern Honshu (Japan's largest island). Radiocarbon dates on the residues
stuck to the interior of the pot dated to 14,500 B.C., pushing back the origin of pottery by
at least another thousand years. At this date, Honshu would have had no more than a
sparse covering of pine trees. And so the theory that Japanese pottery was invented to
store and cook the produce of broad-leaved woodlands cannot be correct.
An archaeologist, Brian Hayden, has proposed an alternative explanation. It provides
another example of his belief in social competition as the driving force of social change
that he applied in explaining the origin of squash cultivation in Mexico. Hayden suggests
that ceramic vessels have a number of important qualities that make them prestigious
objects to own and ideal containers for serving food to guests. At the outset, the potter's
art would have been difficult to master; clay had to be carefully selected, tempers
(materials added to clay to reduce its plasticity), prepared, and construction and firing
techniques explored, practiced, and refined. Neighbors and other visitors would have
been struck with the amount of labor and skill required to produce a pottery vessel. The
display of novel forms with fancy decoration would have impressed them even more. Most
Page 141 of 269
striking of all might have been the dramatic smashing of vessels during feasts as an
ostentatious display of wealth.
Theatrical smashing of pots may have occurred in the later Jomon period, as immense
piles of broken pottery have been found. And as they come in astonishingly elaborate
forms, there can be no doubt that many later Jomon vessels were primarily for display.
They have spectacular rims modeled as licking flames or serpents winding around the
vessel. Sometimes the decoration is so top-heavy that the pots can hardly stand alone.
Lacquered (glossy) objects must have been very striking. But we must be cautious about
applying such interpretations to the earliest and rather dull specimens of pottery. We
currently know too little about the very earliest pottery makers of Japan to decide whether
they had been more concerned with impressing their visitors or devising a means to cook
vegetable stew. We do know, however, that by 9,500B.C., many were living sedentary
lives in permanent settlements. Although pottery had already been invented, the
sedentary lifestyle must have been crucial in enabling ceramic technology to flourish.

35.1: The Origins of the Arctic Fox
The arctic fox lives in the far northern Arctic region with other well-known arctic animals
like the caribou, musk ox, and polar bear. Scientists aren't sure exactly when the arctic
fox first evolved. Arctic fox bone fragments from the Pleistocene epoch (2.6 million-11,700
years ago) are rare, and the ones that do exist are difficult to date with any degree of
accuracy. The oldest confirmed arctic fox bone is believed to be 200,000 years old. There
are other bones that may be 400,000 years old, but whether they belonged to an arctic
fox or some other fox remains under debate. "It's still an open question, "says Love Dalen,
a Swedish biologist who has been using genetics in an attempt to understand the
evolution of the arctic fox. "Right now, the best estimate is that arctic foxes emerged
somewhere between 200,000 and 400,000 years ago, presumably during one of the ice
Ages.”
For many years, researchers believed the species arose in Europe, basing this conclusion
on the location of those 2000-year-old fossils. Since the early 1980s, however, genetic
comparisons between different fox species have revealed some surprising results. For
example, research done by Robert Wayne at the University of California at Los Angeles
has found that the arctic fox, despite its unique appearance and adaptations, is actually
much more closely related to other foxes than had previously been thought. Its closest
living relative, according to genetic studies, is the North American swift fox.
The result suggests one of two scenarios. One is that arctic foxes gave rise to swift foxes,
an evolutionary sequence that would depend on the arctic fox being much older than the
fossil record currently indicates. The second possibility is that swift foxes gave rise to
arctic foxes, likely during the height of a period of glaciation when tundra forming to the
south of the ice sheets may have met the grassland habitat of the swift fox.
On the one hand, the latter scenario could hardly seem more implausible. Swift foxes,
after all, live on the arid, sun-baked prairies and open desert, where temperatures can
top 120°F (49°C). It's hard to imagine a greater environmental leap from this environment
to the frozen tundra. To have acquired over the course of a few hundred thousand years,
all the adaptations necessary for survival in such an extreme environment suggests a
rapid rate of evolution. And for the early species to have so rapidly conquered such a
large territory in a polar region seems equally mystifying.
In other ways, however, this scenario works. As one of the smallest foxes, the swift fox
can survive on very little food, a trait that would have helped its ancestors gradually stray
farther and farther into the biologically barren tundra. And being a nocturnal hunter that
seeks shelter in a den during the day, the swift fox is not overly adapted for life at high
temperatures. Indeed, in the northern parts of their range, modern swift foxes have faced
winter temperatures every bit as severe as those encountered in the Arctic.
From what researchers know about the evolution of other polar species, there seems to
Page 143 of 269
be a pattern of evolution in which species living in the biologically rich temperate zones
give rise to animals that are more specialized for survival in the more extreme Arctic. Polar
bears, for instance, are thought to have evolved from a northern population of brown
bears that learned to hunt seals out on the sea ice. As for the rapid evolution and
widespread dispersal, one must remember that the arctic fox is no ordinary species when
it comes to both reproductive efficiency and migratory tendency; rapid genetic change
and rapid migration would both appear to be well within the species' capabilities.
According to Love Dalen, most of the arctic species evolved during the Quaternary Period
(the last 2.6 million years), and they all seem to have evolved from temperate species. In
evolutionary terms, arctic species are quite young, including, presumably, the arctic fox.
Dalen adds that if that is true, then the arctic fox would have evolved in North America,
though he notes that there is no solid proof either way.

35.2: Deriving Scientific Facts from Theories
In science, a theory is an idea that, once confirmed by experiment or meticulous
observation as certainty, becomes a scientific law. Facts are generally obtained through
empirical research (through observation or experiment). Occasionally, however, facts that
are not easy to obtain directly are deduced from theory. A good example is the work done
in the 1840s on Saturn's rings by the great Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell. At the
time, astronomers had observed three concentric rings about Saturn, all in the same
plane. They knew that at least some regions of the rings must be quite thin since, in some
areas, the planet behind could be plainly seen. Aside from that, their structure was an
intriguing mystery. Maxwell carried out a careful theoretical and highly mathematical
treatment and concluded that the rings could not be single solid or liquid units, since
mechanical forces acting upon rings of such immense size would break them up. He
suggested instead that the rings must be composed of vast numbers of individual solid
particles rotating in separate concentric orbits at different speeds. He even drew some
conclusions about how large the particles would be and how fast they would move.
For many decades, there was no way of testing Maxwell's conclusion, but in the latter
years of the twentieth century, observations-particularly those from Voyager spacecraftconfirmed Maxwell's conclusions. The particles are composed of window-impure ice, or
at least are ice covered. Radar observations have even confirmed the range of masses
and speeds predicted by Maxwell. This was a remarkable achievement on Maxwell's part
of the basis of a theory; he had arrived at factual information that could not be directly
obtained for almost a century and a half.
Scientific work is best done with a theory in mind. It does not matter if the theory is proved
wrong: it will nevertheless guide the initial experiments, which may lead to the correct
theory. Paradoxically, people occasionally do much better with the wrong theory than with
the right one, and there is one rather striking example of this. By the year 1900, physicists
had become aware of the properties of radio waves, which they knew to be of the same
character as light but with much longer wavelengths. Experiments had shown that radio
waves (unlike light) would pass through walls because of the long wavelengths, and that,
like light, they travel in straight lines.
One of the people working on radio waves at the time was the Italian Guglielmo Marconi.
Unlike almost everyone else working on them, he knew hardly any physics. (Hence, the
award to him of the 1909 Nobel Prize for physics amazed and horrified most physicists.)
He did not really understand the properties of electromagnetic waves and did not even
realize that radio waves were of that type. He said that his waves were Marconi waves,
and that, instead of traveling in straight lines, they could be controlled by him to go to any
point he chose. This was nonsense, but his ignorance of physics led him to try to send a
signal across the Atlantic Ocean. No other physicist thought this was a reasonable thing
to try -how could a wave, which has to travel in a straight line, possibly travel so far over
the curved surface of the Atlantic? On December 12, 1901, Marconi's assistant sent
Page 145 of 269
signals across the Atlantic Ocean, from Cornwall, England, to St. John's, Newfoundland,
where Marconi was apparently just able to receive them.
Physicists were quite correct in thinking that radio waves go in straight lines. How, then,
can a radio signal go across the Atlantic, in view of Earth's curved surface? The most
plausible answer is that they are reflected in some way. In 1902, the British physicist
Oliver Heaviside and the American physicist Arthur Edwin Kennelly postulated the
existence of a layer in the upper atmosphere in which they thought that molecules would
be ionized, meaning they would carry electric charges. Such a layer would reflect the
waves from the upper atmosphere and allow them to travel great distances over Earth's
surface.

36.1: Industrial Activities in Britannia
As the Roman Empire expanded throughout Europe, it brought profound changes to
newly conquered lands. One of the later territories to be absorbed as a province was
Britain, in the first century A.D. There, with the arrival of the Roman army and its-relatively
speaking- very rapid advance north, a number of new, or at least improved, technologies
were introduced. Although ceramics had been made in Britain for several millennia, new
kiln (furnace) technology allowed far-better-quality vessels to be made. Furthermore, Iron
Age Britain had developed a specialized and highly artistic metalworking industry; with
Roman technologies came the ability to mass-produce items. Consequently, while Iron
Age communities had mastered many crafts and industries, what the Empire brought was
the apparatus and the will to exploit these activities, with the initial impetus coming from
the army.
It has long been recognized that the army was responsible for many industrial activities
early on in the life of the new province of Britannia, and this conformed to the wellestablished pattern of conquest and Romanization. While undertaking and controlling
industrial production had obvious fiscal, political, and even social benefits, it is unlikely
that these were the initial motives for the role the army took in manufacturing. First and
foremost, the army was the largest consumer of goods in early Roman Britain, and what
the legions required had to either be produced locally or more expensively imported from
abroad. Consequently, it made far more sense for the army to produce as many of its own
goods as possible, on one hand, saving limited financial resources but also ensuring a
controlled supply of items that were vital to the day-to-day existence of the legions.
Not only did the active role of the army in industrial production make strategic sense, but
it was an ideal way to promote the spread of new technologies. While it is well recognized
that legions themselves were made up of people from all over the Empire, what is more
often overlooked is that the army consisted of individuals with diverse skills drawn from
across most of the known world. Glassmaking, among other expertises, was not originally
native to Britain or any of her immediate neighbors, but with the arrival of the army,
practiced experts were immediately placed at the heart of Britannia. It was, therefore,
inevitable, rather than just a matter of chance, that glassmaking became so quickly
established in the first century A.D.
This association of the army with industrial processes can be seen archaeologically, with
many production sites being associated with forts. A typical example can be seen at
Temple borough, South Yorkshire, where excavations just prior to the First World War
revealed the remains of a small glass furnace in the vicus, or attached settlement, of the
fort. Obviously, glassmaking was not the only industrial activity undertaken by the army,
and it is, therefore, no surprise that furnaces have been found in areas of more general
and mixed industrial production. Perhaps the best example of this can be seen just
beyond the confines of the fort at Mancetter in Warwickshire. A glass furnace dating to
the second half of the second century, with associated working waste, was found to be

operating among a group of pottery kilns. This pattern of mixed industrial quarters in close
association with forts is mirrored at other sites across the Western Empire.
However, what is clear is that glassmaking was not being undertaken only at military sites.
Indeed, there is probably more evidence from Britain of glassmaking being practiced in
civilian settlements, and, more specifically, in towns. The growing urban populations of
the first- and second-century provinces were a clear market for any products. And the
possibility of furnaces as close as possible to these populations inevitably reduced
transportation costs and the possibility of accidental breakage through carriage. The main
difference with urban-centered production was that it was less likely to have been
undertaken by the army directly, although since many towns were closely associated with
forts, they still remained likely consumers.

36.2: Iridium and the Terminal Cretaceous Event
There have been a number of natural catastrophes in Earth's past that wiped out huge
numbers of plant and animal species--in effect, "resetting the clock" and requiring a new
start for much of life on Earth. One such catastrophe took place at the end of the Permian
era, some 251 million years ago. But perhaps the most famous one occurred about 65
million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous, causing the dinosaurs to go extinct (except
for a small number that evolved into modern birds). Evidence that the terminal Cretaceous
event was triggered by the impact of an asteroid with Earth began to emerge in the early
1980s, when Luis and Walter Alvarez discovered a thin layer of iridium in rock strata
(layers) 65 million years old at widely separated sites around the world. Iridium is very
rare on Earth's surface but is much more common in some kinds of meteorites. The two
scientists calculated that the impact of such an object, about 10 kilometers across, could
have spread the right amount of iridium around the globe in the cloud of debris (fragments)
blasted out by the impact. The idea was greeted with skepticism at first, but more traces
of debris from an impact occurring at the time of the death of the dinosaurs began to turn
up as geologists searched for evidence for or against the hypothesis. To most people, the
most decisive evidence came in the early 1990s, when a geological feature at Chicxulub
in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico was identified as the remains of an impact crater in
exactly the right place and with exactly the right age to connect it to the terminal
Cretaceous event.
There remained one doubt. Iridium does exist within Earth, and it is brought to the surface
by volcanic eruptions. It still seemed just possible that volcanic eruptions on a truly
massive scale could have put the iridium layer in place, and such eruptions would, of
course, be bad news for life on Earth. There was even a known volcanic event that could
have been responsible. Huge eruptions at roughly the right time spread vast amounts of
lava across what is now west-central India, forming a structure known as the Deccan
Traps. This is one of the largest volcanic features on Earth, more than two kilometers
thick and covering an area of more than a million square kilometers. But, it is not a unique
feature. The Siberian Traps were produced in one of the largest known volcanic events
since the start of the Cambrian, which lasted for a million years and spanned the PermianTriassic boundary about 250 million years ago. This coincided with the terminal Permian
extinction event, which killed some 90 percent of the species existing at the time; in fact,
the eruption of the Siberian Traps almost certainly caused this extinction.
So it is reasonable to implicate the formation of the Deccan Traps with the extinction at
the end of the Cretaceous, and it is certain that such events have played a part in the
history of life on Earth. And it also seems possible that life at the end of the Cretaceous
was already under stress because of the environmental changes associated with the
formation of the Deccan Traps when the meteorite struck. All of these possibilities
encouraged a great deal of work over the best part of the next two decades, culminating
in a meeting of 41 geologists, paleontologists, and other researchers who reviewed all
the data and published their conclusions in the journal Science in 2010. They found that
Page 149 of 269
the volcanic activity lasted for about 1.5 million years, much longer than the time span
over which the famous iridium layer was deposited, and that the eruptions began about
half a million years before the terminal Cretaceous event. During that time, ecosystems
did not change dramatically, but they suddenly collapsed at the time of the Chicxulub
event. In light of all the data, the team concluded that a large asteroid impact 65 million
years ago in modern-day Mexico was the major cause of the mass extinctions.

37.1: The Evolution of Plant Roots
Roots are essential to the development of large plants because they provide a means of
anchoring and maintaining an upright position. Most land plants are literally rooted to the
spot. Roots also play a key role in water and nutrient acquisition. More significantly still,
roots have a tremendous impact on the environment. They can break up rock, bind loose
particles together, and provide a conduit for the movement of water and dissolved
minerals, all of which are essential to the development of soils.
In piecing together a fossil plant to form a conceptual whole, it is usually the rooting
system that remains the final piece in the puzzle. It is often the case that roots are poorly
studied or completely unknown. Although the fossil record of roots is, therefore, less
complete than that of other plant organ systems, it is possible to discern some general
trends. The earliest land plants, like modern mosses and liverworts, did not have welldeveloped root systems. These plants simply bore absorbing hairlike cells on stems and
leaves that grew flat along the ground. From their fossils, some very early plants are
known to have borne branches that appear to be specially modified for rooting. In other
cases, roots were able to form from dormant buds on aerial stems. Fungi are also known
to have played a key role in these early rooting systems, as they do in modern plants.
Fungal symbionts—fungi that live in mutually beneficial relationships with another
organism-have been recorded in the petrified plants of the 400million-year-old Rhynie
Chert fossil site in Scotland, demonstrating a link with mycorrhizal fungi that goes back to
the dawn of the land flora. These tiny, shallow rooting systems were adequate for small
plants (30-50 centimeters tall), but larger organisms required something more substantial.
By the Late Devonian and Early Carboniferous eras (385 to 300 million years ago), an
enormous variety of rooting structures had evolved. The evolution of large erect plants,
and in particular, trees, placed increasing demands upon the anchoring and supply
functions of roots. These problems were solved mainly through the development of more
extensive underground systems. The evolution of the cambium, the layer of living cells
between wood and bark, enabled continuous perennial growth and long-term survival of
roots in soils.
One important consequence of all this was that there was a progressive and massive
increase in root biomass during the Devonian, which had an enormous impact on the
development of soils. Prior to the Devonian, soils, if developed at all, were thought to
have been predominantly thin and of microbial origin. By the Middle Devonian, soil
penetration depths of roots were still shallow (less than 20 centimeters), but this increased
to 1 meter or more as forests spread. The diversity of soils also increased. This change
was brought about by root-induced weathering and mixing. By the end of the Devonian,
there was an increase in soil clay content, structure, and differentiation into distinct
layers—a development that correlated with increases in the depth of root penetration.
Soils with modern profiles (series of layers) are recognizable at this time.
Page 151 of 269
The impact of roots on the environment extends beyond their immediate effects on the
development of soils. The presence of roots in soils increases the natural weathering of
calcium and magnesium silicate minerals. This apparently mundane fact turns out to have
extremely important consequences for climate and temperature globally. Under natural
circumstances, calcium and magnesium silicates react chemically with a dissolved form
of the gas carbon dioxide (a process referred to as weathering), which comes from the
atmosphere. This produces calcium and magnesium carbonates, which are transferred
through the groundwater system to rivers and ultimately to the oceans, where they
accumulate in the form of limestone and dolomite rock. Across the surface of the Earth,
these chemical reactions occur on a vast scale, removing carbon dioxide gas from the
atmosphere and locking it up as carbonate in rock formations. This reduces the so-called
greenhouse effect, which leads to lower global temperatures. In other words, the
widespread development of roots in land plants affected the chemistry of the atmosphere
and the oceans, which, summed over millions of years, added up to changes in climate
on a global scale.

37.2: Herbivores on the Serengeti Plain
Herbivores (plant-eating animals) living in the same environment often compete for food
plants. But in some cases, herbivores may cooperate in the harvesting of plant matter.
The grazing system of large herbivores on the Serengeti Plain of East Africa is an
excellent illustration of how these animals may interact over their food supply. The
Serengeti Plain contains the most spectacular concentration of large mammals found
anywhere in the world. Approximately 1,000,000 wildebeests, 600,000 Thomson's
gazelles, 200,000 zebras, and 65,000 buffalo occupy an area of 23,000 square kilometers
(9,000 square miles), along with undetermined numbers of 20 other species of grazing
animals.
The dominant grazers of the Serengeti Plain are migratory and respond to the growth of
the grasses in a fixed sequence. First, zebras enter the long-grass communities and
remove many of the longer stems. Zebras are followed by wildebeests, which migrate in
very large herds and graze and trample upon the grasses until they are close to the
ground. Wildebeests are, in turn, followed by Thomson's gazelles, which feed on the short
grass during the dry season.
The various grazing species in the Serengeti system do not each select different species
of grasses but instead select different parts of the grass plant during different seasons.
Zebras eat mostly grass stems and sheaths, and almost no grass leaves. Wildebeests
eat more sheaths and leaves, and Thomson's gazelles eat grass sheaths and a large
fraction of herbs not touched by the other two herbivores. These feeding differences have
significant consequences for grazing species because grass stems are very low in protein
and high in lignin, an organic substance that strengthens the cell walls of some plants.
Grass leaves, on the other hand, are relatively high in protein and low in lignin, which
means leaves provide more energy per gram of dry weight than stems. Herb leaves
typically contain even more protein and energy than grass leaves. So zebras seem to
have the worst diet and Thomson's gazelles the best.
How can zebras cope with grass stems as the major part of their diet during the dry
season? Most of the grazing animals in the Serengeti are ruminants, animals that have a
specialized stomach containing bacteria and protozoa that break down the cellulose in
the cell walls of plants. But the zebra is not a ruminant and is similar to the horse in having
a simple stomach. Zebras survive by processing a much larger volume of plant material
through their gut than ruminants do, perhaps roughly twice as much. So even though a
zebra cannot extract all the protein and energy from the grass stems, it eats more, and
thus, compensates by volume. Zebras also have the advantage of being larger than
wildebeests and Thomson's gazelles, and larger animals need less energy and less
protein per unit of weight than smaller animals do.
It would seem that competition for food would occur between wildebeests and Thomson's
gazelles because they eat the same parts of the grass. Wildebeests have what appears
Page 153 of 269
to be a devastating effect on the grassland as they pass through in migration. Green
biomass was reduced by 85 percent and average plant height by 56 percent on sample
plots. By establishing fenced areas as grazing enclosures, one researcher was able to
follow the subsequent changes both in grassland areas subject to wildebeest grazing and
in areas protected from all grazing. Grazed areas recovered after the wildebeest migration
had passed and produced a short, dense lawn of green grass leaves. As gazelles entered
the area during the dry season, they concentrated their feeding on areas where
wildebeests had previously grazed, and they avoided areas of grassland that the
wildebeest herd had missed.
Grass production was reduced by both wildebeests and gazelles, but no signs of
competition were found. The Serengeti grazing populations instead show evidence of
grazing facilitation, in which the feeding activity of herbivore species improves the food
supply available to a second species. Heavy grazing by wildebeests prepares the grass
community for subsequent exploitation by Thomson's gazelles in the same general way
that zebra feeding improves wildebeest grazing.

38.1: British Agriculture
England was one of the first nations in the modern period to increase the efficiency of its
agricultural production, making it possible to produce the same or more while using fewer
workers. By the end of the seventeenth century, England was already in advance of most
of continental Europe in agricultural productivity, with only about 60 percent of its workers
involved primarily in food production. Although the actual number of workers in agriculture
continued to grow until the middle of the nineteenth century, the proportion declined
steadily to about 36 percent at the beginning of the nineteenth century, to about 22
percent in the mid-nineteenth century (when the absolute number was at its maximum),
and to less than 10 percent at the beginning of the twentieth century.
The means by which England increased its agricultural productivity owed much to trialand-error experimentation with new crops and new crop rotations. Turnips, clover, and
other fodder crops (plants used to feed livestock) were introduced from the Netherlands
in the sixteenth century and became widely diffused in the seventeenth. Probably the
most important agricultural innovation before scientific agriculture was introduced in the
nineteenth century was the development of so-called convertible husbandry, involving the
alternation of field crops with temporary pastures in place of permanent cultivated fields
and pastures. This had the double advantage of restoring the fertility of the soil through
improved rotation, including leguminous crops, and of maintaining a larger number of
livestock, thus producing more manure for fertilizer as well as more meat, dairy produce,
and wool. Many landowners and farmers also experimented with selective breeding of
livestock.
An important condition for both the improved rotations and selective breeding was the
enclosure (the conversion of common land into private plots) and consolidation of the
fields. Under the traditional open field system, it was difficult, if not impossible, to obtain
agreement among the many participants on the introduction of new crops or rotation; and
with livestock grazing in common herds, it was equally difficult to manage selective
breeding. The most famous enclosures were those carried out by acts of Parliament (the
British governing body) between 1760 and 1815. Enclosure by private agreement,
however, had been going on almost continually since the late Middle Ages; it was
especially active in the late seventeenth and the first six decades of the eighteenth
centuries. By that time, more than half of England's arable land (land that can be farmed
productively) had been enclosed.
The new agricultural landscape that emerged to replace villages surrounded by their open
fields consisted of fields that were compact, consolidated, and closed in by walls, fences,
or hedges. Along with the processes of enclosure and technological improvement, a
gradual tendency toward larger farms emerged, further boosting productivity. By 1851,
about one-third of the cultivated acreage was in farms larger than 300 acres; farms
smaller than 100 acres accounted for only 22 percent of the land. Even so, the occupants
of the small farms outnumbered those of the others almost two to one. The reason for this
Page 155 of 269
is that the small farmers were owner-occupiers who farmed the land with the help of family
labor; the larger farmers rented pieces of their property to others and hired landless
agricultural workers. It used to be thought that the enclosures led to a loss of population
in the countryside, but in fact, the new techniques of cultivation associated with them
actually increased the demand for labor. Not until the second half of the nineteenth
century, with the introduction of such farm machinery as threshers, harvesters, and steam
plows, did the absolute size of the agricultural labor force begin to decrease.
In the meantime, the increasing productivity of English agriculture enabled it to feed a
burgeoning population at steadily rising standards of nutrition. For about a century, from
1660 to 1760, English farmers produced a surplus for export; after that period, the rate of
population growth overtook the rate of increase in productivity. The relatively prosperous
rural population provided a ready market for manufacturing goods, ranging from
agricultural implements to such consumer products as clothing, pewter-ware, and
porcelain.

38.2: The Documentary Film in the United States
In the United States, the nonfiction film was primarily defined and sustained by the
travelogue, which was filmed in foreign lands and shown at lectures and sideshows to
introduce audiences to different cultures and exotic locations. In 1904, at the St. Louis
Exposition, George C. Hale's Tours and Scenes of the World was particularly successful
but did not reach the mythic proportions of the film made from President Teddy
Roosevelt's African safaris or Robert Scott's expedition to the South Pole. These kinds of
travelogues appealed to the American public because they demonstrated a spirit of
enterprise and adventure. This outlook underpins the Romantic tradition of filmmaking
that begins with travelogues of the American West and comes to its fullest expression in
the films of Robert Flaherty. It is he who most embodies the development of the
documentary form as an objective tool of ethnography- -the scientific study of other
cultures from a position "within" the community- -and anthropology.
His film Nanook of the North (1922), a study of Inuits of northern Canada, is
acknowledged as one of the most influential films within the genre. It perhaps provides us
with all the clues we require to define both the documentary and its acceptable limits.
Flaherty's films, which have been called “authored" films, are made with a specific intent:
not merely to record the lives of the Inuits but to recall and restage a former, more
“primitive" era of Inuit life. This nostalgic intent only serves to mythologize Inuit life and,
to some extent, remove it from its real context, thus calling into question some of the
inherent principles that we may assume are crucial in determining documentary “truth."
Although Flaherty was an advocate of the use of lenses that could view the subject from
a long distance so as not to affect unduly the behavior of the natives, and he filmed long,
uninterrupted scenes at one time without stopping the camera instead of using complex
editing, it is his intervention in the material that is most problematic when evaluating
Nanook as a key documentary. Flaherty was not content merely to record events; he
wanted to dramatize actuality by filming aspects of Inuit culture that he knew of from his
earlier travels into the Hudson Bay area between 1910 and 1916. For example, he rebuilt
igloos to accommodate camera equipment and organized parts of the Inuit lifestyle to suit
the technical requirements of filming under these conditions. In another of his
documentaries, Moana (1926), Flaherty staged a ritual tattooing ceremony among the
Samoan Islanders, recalling a practice that had not been carried out for many years. In
Man of Aran (1935), shark hunts were also staged and did not characterize the
contemporary existence of the Aran Islanders.
John Grierson, the British documentary maker, argues that Flaherty becomes intimate
with the subject matter before he records it and thus, “He lives with his people till the story
is told 'out of himself' and this enables him to 'make the primary distinction between a
method which describes only the surface value of a subject and a method that more
explosively reveals the reality of it." This seems to legitimize Flaherty's approach because
Nanook, Moana, and Man of Aran all succeed in revealing the practices of more “primitive”
Page 157 of 269
cultures- cultures which in Flaherty's view embody a certain kind of simple and
romanticized social perfection.
Clearly then, Flaherty essentially uses actuality to illustrate dominant themes and
interests that he is eager to explore. In some ways, Flaherty ignores the real social and
political dimensions informing his subjects' lives and, indeed, does not engage with the
darker side of human sensibility, preferring instead to prioritize larger, more mythic, and
universal topics. There is almost a nostalgic yearning in Flaherty's work to return to a
simpler, more physical, preindustrial world, where humankind could pit itself against the
natural world, slowly but surely harnessing its forces to positive ends. Families and
communities are seen as stoic and noble in their endeavors, often surviving against
terrible odds. Flaherty obviously manipulates his material and sums up one of the
apparent ironies in creating documentary “truth" by suggesting that “Sometimes you have
to lie. One often has to distort a thing to catch its true spirit."

39.1: The Decline of the Arctic Fox in Scandinavia
The arctic fox has lived in the Scandinavian countries of Norway, Finland, and Sweden
since the last Ice Age, which ended more than 10,000 years ago. Today, however, the
Arctic fox in Scandinavia is in severe trouble. Despite intense conservation efforts, its
numbers have been radically declining. Why this most resourceful of species has been
unable to rebound since hunting it was prohibited is not altogether clear.
One possibility is that the animals have gone through what biologists refer to as a
population bottleneck. Such bottlenecks occur when the number of animals in a given
population is reduced to the point where inbreeding enables the enhanced proliferation
of genes that may be detrimental to a species' overall fitness (ability to survive). A related
hypothesis is that the arctic foxes had lost their genetic advantage owing to the spread of
genes from selectively bred foxes that escaped from farms. Captive-raised foxes are
known to have escaped, and recent genetic studies from Norway have shown that such
interbreeding between farm-bred foxes and foxes in the wild has indeed taken place.
While these results are being viewed as potential future trouble, there is still no indication
that they explain past difficulties. The number of crossover genes detected in the
Norwegian study was small, suggesting that mixing between wild and escaped foxes is a
recent occurrence.
Among changes in the environment that might be to blame, one of the earliest ideas
relates to the absence of wolves, animals that, for thousands of years, filled the role of
top predator throughout Scandinavia but that disappeared from most of Norway and
Sweden during the twentieth century after hundreds of years of persecution. There is no
winter sea ice along the coastlines of Norway and western Russia, as there is throughout
the Canadian Arctic and off the coast of Siberia, meaning the arctic foxes in this part of
the world have no access to remains of polar bears' prey, an important source of food for
arctic foxes. What they do have access to is reindeer. Since wolves are the only predator
of reindeer in Scandinavia, it has been argued that the elimination of the wolf has led to
a decline in the availability of a necessary winter food supply.
Scientists, however, have been unable to uncover any strong evidence to support the
claim that arctic foxes are suffering because of the absence of large predators. One study
even suggests arctic foxes do better in the absence of large predators because when
animals such as reindeer die of natural causes, the foxes have the large carcasses all to
themselves. Also casting doubt on the wolf's culpability is the fact that it had been hunted
out of many alpine regions of Scandinavia during the mid-nineteenth century, long before
the arctic fox entered into its decline. What's now known about wolf biology suggests the
amount of meat and entrails (internal organs) left behind by these animals may not be
sufficient to have a noticeable impact on the arctic fox population.
Today, there is little enthusiasm among Arctic fox scientists for the idea that a lack of
wolves is to blame. Instead, most now believe the trouble stems from the increased
Page 159 of 269
presence of another canine carnivore- one that, in the eyes of the arctic fox at least, is far
more ferocious: the red fox. The red fox is one of the most successful carnivores
anywhere. It has evolved a repertoire of instincts that has enabled it to thrive in a world
increasingly dominated by humans and human-altered landscapes.
For the most part, arctic foxes and red foxes occupy different environmental niches.
Generally, the arctic fox keeps to the tundra, while the red fox is at home in a wide range
of habitats throughout the northern hemisphere. In recent decades, however, there is
evidence that red foxes are increasingly encroaching on what previously had been
territory inhabited only by arctic foxes. During the nineteenth century, there were
occasional red fox sightings on southern Baffin Island in Canada, but none of the animals
were known to settle down and breed. In the last half of the twentieth century, however,
they returned and became a permanent population there.

39.2: The Cooling of Early Earth
Earth formed just under 4.6 billion years ago, and for its first 50 to 100 million years, it
was a boiling ball of liquid rock without a permanent crust (hard outermost layer). An
important event in Earth's earliest phase is known as the differentiation event, which
completely changed the initially uniform composition of the planet. It happened around
4.5 billion years ago when the planet had grown large enough for the pressure to drive
temperatures in the interior above 1,000℃ (degrees Celsius), the point at which rocks
melt. Then, denser (metal-rich) materials sank to the center of the planet, and less dense
(rocky) materials rose toward the surface. The sinking dense materials formed Earth's
nickel-iron core, the planet's inner 3,500 kilometers or so. The lighter materials that rose
up formed the less-dense rocky mantle, the planet's outer 2,900 kilometers.
The formation of Earth's core transformed conditions on Earth's surface. This is because
it created the right conditions for the development of the planet's magnetic field, which
originates from movements in the outer layers of Earth's core. It had been known for a
while that the magnetic field was already operational by about 3.5 billion years ago, and
very recent research has brought that back to before 4 billion years ago. The magnetic
field is Earth's only real protection against the solar wind (charged particles from the Sun),
which was stripping gases from the earliest atmosphere before the magnetic field had
started up. Thus, the differentiation event is thought to have been critical for reducing the
loss of light elements from the atmosphere to space. Without it, Earth might have ended
up without hydrogen, and, thus, without water. And over time, many heavier gases would
also have been stripped off by the solar wind. Mars is thought to have started out with a
magnetic field but—being much smaller than Earth—to have cooled enough for its
magnetic field to die around 4 billion years ago. It subsequently lost almost all of its
atmosphere and surface water. While this often-used explanation for retaining an
atmosphere by the presence of a magnetic field sounds plausible, some further thought
suggests that things may be a little more complicated. Venus has no magnetic field and
is closer to the Sun, yet it has a very well-developed atmosphere. Venus and Earth have
similar sizes and masses, while Mars is much smaller—hence, gravity may have been
equally or more important for retaining an atmosphere than a magnetic field, especially
when the gases concerned are heavier gases, like the dominant CO2 (carbon dioxide) on
Venus.
At Earth's position in the earliest solar system, temperatures of 250°C to 350°C would be
expected, but the energy from the intense early impacting by objects from space had
pushed temperatures up well above the melting temperature of rocks. Still, research has
demonstrated that as early as about 4.4 billion years ago, Earth's surface had not only
cooled sufficiently to form an early crust (likely below 1,000°C) but even enough to allow
for the presence of liquid water, which at modern atmospheric pressure would mean that
temperatures had dropped below 100°C. However, at higher pressures, this value is
higher, and we don't really know how dense the early atmosphere was. So 100°C is a
lower estimate; true temperatures may have been double that value if the early
Page 161 of 269
atmosphere was very dense.
Now that clouds and rain had appeared on the scene, oceans began to develop. Large
portions of the planet were covered with water by about 4 billion years ago. This is
somewhat unexpected because, at this time, Earth's fiery birth phase had rapidly settled
down, and the Sun was only about 70 percent as strong as it is today. After their first bright
ignition, stars like the Sun shine more weakly and then grow gradually more intense with
age; we refer to this as the "faint young Sun." With only 70 percent of the modern energy
coming in from the Sun, early Earth should have been covered by ice, not water.
Somehow, Earth's early atmosphere must have retained heat more effectively than the
modern atmosphere. Indeed, reconstructions of the early atmosphere's composition
suggest high levels of CO2, water vapor, and methane, which would have caused efficient
heat retention.

40.1: The Commercialization of Agriculture in the United States
Thomas Jefferson, a Founding Father of the United States, believed that farmers were
the foundation of American democracy. To execute his plan for democracy, Jefferson
proposed the United States Rectangular Land Survey- -familiarly known as the grid.
Under the plan, surveyors were first sent to eastern Ohio with instructions to divide the
land into boxes that would measure six miles square. Then they were instructed to divide
these larger boxes into smaller ones, one-mile square, which were divided yet again into
quarter sections measuring 160 acres each, which was considered to be the appropriate
size for a single farm. In 1785, Congress passed the grid into law, and from that point on,
the same checkerboard pattern was etched across the West- -one of the most farreaching attempts at rationalizing a landscape in world history.
The grid was the outward expression of a culture wedded not simply to democracy but to
markets and exchange as well. It would aid in the rapid settlement of the country, turning
millions of Americans into independent landowners, while at the same time transforming
the land itself- its varied topography, soil, and water conditions- into a commodity, a
uniform set of boxes easily bought and sold. But the grid was only the first step in the
commercialization of Western farmlands.
Once farmers purchased land, they needed to plow up the existing vegetation. The
grasses that thrived on the organically rich, deep soil laid down by the glaciers thousands
of years earlier were at first a challenge to cut. Wooden plows with edges made of iron
proved virtually useless. The development and spread of the steel plow-invented in 1837
by John Deere, an Illinois blacksmith- -made plowing successful. In place of the native
vegetation, farmers planted corn and wheat, domesticated species of grass that grow
best in a monocultural environment, that is, in fields by themselves. These crops tend to
grow quickly, storing carbohydrates in their seeds. With bread constituting a major
component of the American diet, wheat would eventually emerge as the West's major
cash crop; acres and acres of some of the world's best agricultural land in states such as
Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, and Kansas were plowed up and given over to the plant.
In the early years of settlement, farmers grew a variety of grains, including wheat, corn,
oats, rye, and barley. Increasingly, however, farmers became more specialized, as
commercial agriculture, aided by improved railroad transportation, proceeded apace.
Much of the grain ended up in the Northeast, where, by the 1840s, population growth had
outstripped the local farm economy's ability to provide. In effect, the West's surplus of soil
wealth underwrote the industrial development farther east.
The railroads not only delivered the products of the rich soils of the Western grasslands
into the stomachs of Easterners, but they also changed the meaning of the crops
themselves. With waterborne transportation, farmers put their grain into sacks so they
could easily be loaded into the irregularly shaped holds of steamboats. The advent of the
railroads and steam-powered grain elevators (first developed in 1842) spurred farmers to
Page 163 of 269
eliminate the sack altogether. Now grain would move like a stream of water, making its
journey to market with the aid of a mechanical device that loaded all the wheat from a
particular area into one large grain car. Sacks had preserved the identity of each load of
grain. With the new technology, however, grain from different farms was mixed together
and sorted by grade. The Chicago Board of Trade (established in 1848) divided wheat
into three categories- spring, white winter, and red winter- -applying quality standards to
each type. Wheat was turned into an abstract commodity, with ownership over the grain
diverging from the physical product itself. By the 1860s, a future market in grain had even
emerged in Chicago. It was now possible to enter into a contract to purchase or sell grain
at a particular price. What was being marketed here was not the physical grain itself so
much as an abstraction, the right to trade something that may not even have been grown
yet.

40.2: The Angiosperm Revolution
Of all the kinds of modern land plants, one group dominates: the angiosperms, or
flowering plants. With over 250,000 living species, they are the majority of plants in most
habitats- except marine environments, which are still habitats for the more primitive algae.
But angiosperms were a comparatively recent development in plant evolution. They arose
in the mid-Mesozoic (approximately 200 million years ago to 145 million years ago), but
by about 100 million years ago, they had pushed the conifers (plants having cone-shaped
reproductive structures rather than flowers for reproduction) into the background. Even
earlier types of plants, such as ferns, are now restricted to certain wet habitats, and many
of the dominant gymnosperms (plants with exposed seeds, such as conifers) of the early
Mesozoic have now been largely replaced by angiosperms; the formerly dominant
gymnosperms that did not become completely extinct now survive in comparatively few
places.
Why were the angiosperms so successful? A major advantage they have over more
primitive plants is their efficient mode of reproduction- -the flower and all of its complex
reproductive mechanisms that ensure success. Instead of the inefficient wind-pollinated
gymnosperm seed, which wastes a huge amount of pollen and is dependent on random
breezes, angiosperms have evolved flowers specifically as devices to attract pollinators-
-mainly insects (especially moths, butterflies, and bees) but also birds, bats, and other
flying creatures. The pollinators ensure that the pollen is carried directly from one flower
of the same species to another, which is more efficient than relying on the wind. This
process of delivery is called cross-pollination. The reproductive cycle is highly modified:
the ovules (egg-producing organs) are fully enclosed within protective covers called
carpels, which form the core of the flower. The carpel protects the ovule from drying out,
from fungal infection, and from predation by plant-eating insects. Pollen-producing organs
called stamens are surrounded by petals (which serve to attract the pollinator and guide
it to the ovules in many cases) and an outer covering of sepals for protection. Typically, a
pollinator gets pollen stuck onto it as it climbs into a flower, seeking the nectar that is
generated to lure it. The ovule is usually pollinated by the sperm carried from a different
flower, thus minimizing self-fertilization (but angiosperms can also self-fertilize if crosspollination is not possible).
Once the pollen has been delivered, a pollen tube transports the sperm to the ovules.
Here, angiosperms have another advantage: double fertilization. The pollen carries two
sperm nuclei, one of which fuses with the egg nucleus to form the embryo, the other of
which fuses with two other nuclei to form a food supply for the embryo. This means that
angiosperms don't need to invest a lot of energy in creating food stores for each seed
until it is fertilized (unlike gymnosperms, which create food even for infertile seeds).
The entire process of fertilization and producing an embryo takes place in only a few
weeks or days, so angiosperms can sprout, flower, reproduce, and die in a single season
if necessary. By contrast, most gymnosperms are slow to grow and reproduce (usually
Page 165 of 269
taking at least eighteen months between reproductive cycles) and cannot accomplish the
entire process in a single season. For gymnosperms such as evergreen conifers to live
in highly seasonal, cold-winter climates, they must be able to survive the cold and shut
down much of their physiological systems during winter. Many angiosperms, on the other
hand, are annuals- sprouting in the spring, flowering, and producing seeds that can
survive until the next winter while the rest of the plant dies. This rapid reproduction
enables them to quickly exploit habitats that other plants cannot.
Finally, angiosperms are known not only for their rapid growth rates but for their ability to
grow back quickly after they have been munched by animals. Think of how quickly the
grass grows back after you mow it (or an animal grazes it). By contrast, ferns cannot grow
back so quickly after they have been heavily eaten, and often die if the damage is too
great (such as when an animal eats the growing tip of the plant)- whereas many
angiosperms can be eaten right down to their roots but grow back again.

41.1: Formation of the Solar System
Where did the solar system come from? This question has tantalized astronomers for
centuries. While we do not yet have a wholly complete answer, a consensus has arisen
about the most likely series of events that led to the present-day system of the Sun and
planets.
A key piece of evidence about the origin of the solar system is that all the planets orbit
the Sun in the same direction and in nearly the same plane. As long ago as the eighteenth
century, German philosopher Immanuel Kant and French scientist Pierre-Simon D.E.
Laplace independently suggested that this state of affairs could not be a coincidence.
They proposed that our entire solar system-the Sun, as well as all of the planets, satellites,
asteroids, and comets-formed from a vast, rotating cloud of gas and dust called the solar
nebula. ln the modern version of their theory, the solar nebula is thought to have had a
mass somewhat greater than that of our present-day Sun.
Each part of the nebula exerted a gravitational attraction on the other parts, and these
mutual gravitational pulls tended to make the nebula contract. As it contracted, the
greatest concentration of matter occurred at the center of the nebula, forming a relatively
dense region called the protosun, which eventually developed into the Sun. The planets
formed from the much lesser amount of material in the outer regions of the solar nebula.
Indeed, the mass of all the planets together is only 0.1 percent of the mass of the Sun.
When you drop a ball, the gravitational attraction of Earth makes the ball travel faster and
faster as it falls; in the same way, material falling inward toward the protosun would have
gained speed. As this fast-moving material ran into the protosun, the energy of the
collision was converted into thermal energy, causing the temperature deep inside the
solar nebula to climb. While the protosun's surface temperature stayed roughly constant,
the temperature inside the protosun increased even more by means of further contraction.
Eventually, after perhaps 100 million years had passed since the solar nebula first began
to contract, the central temperature of the protosun reached a few million degrees, and
nuclear reactions began in its interior. When this happened, the contraction stopped, and
a true star (the Sun) was born. Nuclear reactions in the interior of the present-day Sun
are the source of all the energy that the Sun radiates into space.
If the solar nebula had not been rotating at all, everything would have fallen directly into
the protosun, leaving nothing behind to form the planets. Instead, the solar nebula must
have had an overall slight rotation, which caused its evolution to follow a different path.
As the slowly rotating nebula collapsed inward, it would naturally have tended to rotate
faster. Figure skaters use this same phenomenon; when a spinning figure skater pulls her
arms and legs inward, close to her body, the rate at which she spins automatically
increases. As the solar nebula began to rotate more rapidly, it also tended to flatten out,
just as a spinning ball of dough flattens out when it is spun rapidly by a pizza chef. The
eventual result was a structure with a rotating flattened disk surrounding a newly formed
Page 167 of 269
Sun. The planets formed later from this disk, which explains why their orbits all lie in
essentially the same plane and why they all orbit the Sun in the same direction.
Naturally, there were no humans to observe these processes taking place during the
formation of our solar system. But astronomers have seen disks of material surrounding
other stars that formed only recently. These are called protoplanetary disks, or proplyds,
because it is thought that planets can eventually form from these disks around other stars.
By studying these proplyds, astronomers are able to examine what our solar nebula may
have been like some 5 billion years ago.

41.2: El Nino and the Southern Oscillation
Between the ocean surface and the atmosphere, there is an exchange of heat and
moisture that depends, in part, on temperature differences between water and air. Even
a relatively small change in surface ocean temperatures could modify atmospheric
circulations and have far-reaching effects on global weather patterns.
Along the west coast of South America, where the cool Peru Current sweeps northward,
southerly winds promote upwelling (rising to the surface and flowing outward) of cold,
nutrient-rich water that gives rise to large fish populations, especially anchovies. The
abundance of fish supports a large population of seabirds whose droppings (ale guano)
produce huge phosphate-rich deposits that support the fertilizer industry. Near the end of
the calendar year, a warm current of nutrient-poor tropical water often moves southward,
replacing the cold, nutrient-rich surface water.
In most years, the warming lasts for only a few weeks to a month or more, after which
weather patterns usually return to normal and fishing improves. However, when
conditions last for many months and a more extensive ocean warming occurs, the
economic results can be catastrophic. This extremely warm episode, which occurs at
irregular intervals of two to seven years and covers a large area of the tropical Pacific
Ocean, is now referred to as a major El Nino event, or simply El Nino.
During a major El Nino event, large numbers of fish and marine plants may die. Dead fish
and birds may litter the water and beaches of Peru; their decomposing bodies reduce the
water's oxygen supply, which leads to the bacterial production of huge amounts of
hydrogen sulfide. The El Nino of 1972-1973 reduced the annual Peruvian anchovy catch
from 10.3 million metric tons in 1971 to 4.6 million metric tons in 1972. Since much of the
harvest of this fish is converted into fish meal and exported for use in feeding livestock
and poultry, the world's meal production in 1972 was greatly reduced. Countries such as
the United States that rely on meals for animal feed had to use soybeans as an
alternative. This raised poultry prices in the United States by more than 40 percent.
Why does the ocean become so warm over the eastern tropical Pacific? Normally in the
tropical Pacific Ocean, there are the trades-persistent winds that blow westward from a
region of higher pressure over the eastern Pacific toward a region of lower pressure
centered near Indonesia. The trades create upwelling that brings cold water to the
surface. As this water moves westward, it is heated by sunlight and the atmosphere.
Consequently, in the Pacific Ocean, surface water along the equator usually is cool in the
east and warm in the west. In addition, the dragging of surface water by the trades raises
the sea level in the western Pacific and lowers it in the eastern Pacific, which produces a
thick layer of warm water over the tropical western Pacific Ocean and a weak ocean
current (called the counter current) that flows slowly eastward toward South America.
Every few years, the surface atmospheric pressure patterns break down as air pressure
Page 169 of 269
rises over the region of the western Pacific and falls over the eastern Pacific. This change
in pressure weakens the trades, and, during strong pressure reversals, east winds are
replaced by west winds. The west winds strengthen the counter current, causing warm
water to head eastward toward South America over broad areas of the tropical Pacific.
Toward the end of the warming period, which may last between one and two years,
atmospheric pressure over the eastern Pacific reverses and begins to rise, whereas, over
the western Pacific, it falls. This seesaw pattern of reversing surface air pressure at
opposite ends of the Pacific Ocean is called the Southern Oscillation. Because the
pressure reversals and ocean warming are more or less simultaneous, scientists call this
phenomenon the El Nino/Southern Oscillation, or ENSO for short. Although most ENSO
episodes follow similar evolution, each event has its own personality, differing in both
strength and behavior.

42.1: Beaks of Darwin' Finches
In 1835, before he had developed his theory of evolution, Charles Darwin collected
specimens of 13 previously unknown species of finches from the isolated Galapagos
Islands. The Galapagos finches closely resembled a species of finches living on the
mainland of South America, but each of the Galapagos species of finches had a differently
shaped beak unique to it. His observations led Darwin to speculate that "from an original
paucity of birds in this archipelago [the Galapagos Islands], one species has been taken
and modified for different ends." This is the essence of Darwin's theory of evolution by
natural selection: Birds with a particular beak shape survived and reproduced because
their beak made them well-adapted to using a particular food source. In this way, one
original species that came to Galapagos from the mainland ultimately evolved into 13 new
species.
The correspondence between the beaks of the 13 finch species and their food source
immediately suggested to Darwin that evolution had shaped them. If his suggestion that
the beak of an ancestral finch had been shaped by evolution is correct, then it ought to
be possible to see the different species of finches acting out their evolutionary roles, each
using their beaks to acquire their particular food specialty. The four species that crush
seeds within their beaks, for example, should feed on different seeds, those with stouter
beaks specializing in harder-to-crush seeds.
Many biologists visited the Galapagos after Darwin, but it was 100 years before anyone
tried this key test of his hypothesis when the great naturalist David Lack finally set out to
do this in 1938. observing the birds closely for a full five months, his observations seemed
to contradict Darwin's proposal. Lack often observed many different species of finch
feeding together on the same seeds. We now know that it was Lack's misfortune to study
the birds during a wet year when food was plentiful. The finch's beak is of little importance
in such flush times; small seeds are so abundant that birds of all species are able to get
enough to eat.
The key to successfully testing Darwin's proposal that the beaks of Galapagos finches
are adaptations to different food sources, proved to be patience. Starting in 1973, Peter
and Rosemary Grant of Princeton University and generations of their students have
studied the medium ground finch Geospiza fortis on a tiny island in the center of the
Galapagos called Daphne Major. These finches feed preferentially on small, tender seeds
produced in abundance by plants in wet years. The birds resort to larger, drier seeds,
which are harder to crush, only when small seeds become depleted during long periods
of dry weather, and plants produce few seeds.
The Grants quantified beak shape among the medium ground finches of Daphne Major
by carefully measuring beak depth (width of the beak, from top to bottom, at its base) on
individual birds. Measuring many birds every year, they were able to assemble a detailed
portrait of evolution in action. The Grants found that beak depth changed from one year
Page 171 of 269
to the next in a predictable fashion. During droughts, plants produced few seeds, and all
available small seeds were quickly eaten, leaving large seeds as the remaining source of
food. As a result, birds with large beaks survived better, because they were better able to
break open these large seeds. Consequently, the average beak depth of birds in the
population increased the next year, only to decrease again when wet seasons returned.
Could these changes in the beak dimension reflect the action of natural selection? An
alternative possibility might be that the changes in beak depth do not reflect changes in
gene frequencies, but rather are simply a response to diet- -perhaps during lean times,
the birds become malnourished and then grow stouter beaks, for example. If this were
the case, it would not be genetics but environment alone that influences beak size. To
rule out this possibility, the Grants measured the relation of parent bill size to offspring
beak size, examining many broods over several years. The depth of the beak was passed
down faithfully from one generation to the next, regardless of environmental conditions,
suggesting that the differences in beak size indeed reflected genetic differences.

42.2: Sequencing Ice Ages
Traditionally, climate scientists believed that Earth underwent four major periods of
glaciation (being covered by ice sheets) with the warm interglacial in between. But climate
research has now shown that over the past 800,000 years, Earth has seen a complex
pattern of some twenty major climatic shifts, with temperatures alternating between very
warm and intensely cold, featuring warm seas in northern Europe at one extreme and ice
sheets covering vast areas of the globe at the other. The cause of these fluctuations lies
in the complex relationship between Earth and the Sun. We are all familiar with the fact
that Earth orbits the Sun and that it spins around its own axis, which is at an angle to the
plane of its orbit. This causes some parts of Earth's surface to be nearer the Sun for
periods of time, accounting for the differences between summer and winter. If all parts of
this system were stable, Earth's climate would remain constant, but this is not so. First,
Earth's orbit is not perfectly circular but is slightly elliptical, causing a variation on a
100,000-year cycle. Secondly, the axis of Earth Changes its tilt (angle by a fraction over
a 41,000-year cycle); and thirdly, the planet has a slight wobble (shaking movement)
about its axis as it spins, setting up changes over a cycle of 23,000 years. The
combination of all these factors (known as the Milankovitch cycles) creates very small
changes in the Sun-Earth relationship that determine the expansion or contraction of the
polar ice cap and, thus, the sequence of fluctuating ice ages.
The complexity of these changes has taken some time to unravel. The earliest work was
done on glaciers in the Alpine region, and it was here that the four major stages of
glaciation were identified, providing a useful regional sequence. More recently, over the
last fifty years or so, work on deep-sea cores has pioneered a new way to study the
phenomenon globally. The principle is quite simple: Deep-sea cores provide stratified
sequences of accumulations of calcium carbonate derived from the shells of dead
organisms. The calcium carbonate in these layers contains two different oxygen isotopes
(oxygen of different atomic weights), (16)O and (18)O, which the organisms extract from
the atmosphere. Since it can be shown that cold conditions favor (18)O over (16)O, by
assessing the ratio of the two, it is possible to arrive at a direct measurement relating to
the temperature of the ocean at the time of deposition. From these measurements, a
system of twenty phases, known as marine isotope stages, can be distinguished,
reflecting changes in Earth's climate. The method was extremely valuable in providing a
relative sequence, but it needed to be calibrated to give approximate dates for the phases.
The breakthrough came when, in one of the cores, it was possible to identify a point at
which a major reversal had occurred in Earth's magnetic field, the time when the North
and South Poles took up their present positions. This same reversal has been recorded
in rocks, which could be dated to around 736,000 years ago using an absolute dating
method. With this one point securely established and assuming that the deep-sea
sediments had accumulated at a standard rate, it has been possible to assign dates to
the entire sequence. Another valuable dating method, which has been developed over
the last thirty years, is based on cores bored out of the Greenland ice cap. The largest
Page 173 of 269
core is 3,000 meters deep and represents the buildup of the ice over a 110,000-year
period. From the cores, it is possible to measure annual increments, one year's winter ice
being separated from the next year's by a fine dust layer formed during the summer melt.
The temperatures prevailing at the time are estimated from the (16)O to (18)O ratios and
from the proportions of the windblown chemical particles. The cores provide a very
precise, dated sequence of climatic events extending back from the present.

43.1: The Roman Road System of Britain
During its occupation of Britain (A.D. 43-410), the Roman Empire built an extensive
network of roads. The Roman government recognized four categories of roads ranging in
order from the most important to the least: public roads funded by the state; military roads
built at the army’s expense but also used by the public; local roads on which less
engineering effort was expended; and private roads that were built and maintained by
their owners. The latter two categories encompassed roads and tracks of varying quality.
Before the Romans built roads, the ancient trackways of Britain had followed the natural
terrain, seeking the easiest ground to traverse. Such tracks often detoured around marshy
areas, hills, or ravines. Romans did not like to waste effort building long, meandering
roads, so they ignored the older routes, preferring instead to move in the straightest line
possible except where major obstacles in the landscape left no choice. Since Roman
roads usually connected such new places of military importance as forts, towns, and
administrative centers, the old trackways often did not take the desired direction. There
were a few exceptions. Silchester was one of the pre-Roman centers of British activity
reused by the Romans. There, the old native roads connected to the new road system.
Laying roads, the shortest distance by going through obstacles, required a great
investment of labor. If a hill stood in the way, the earth was hauled away until the land
was leveled. If a wetland needed to be crossed, the earth was moved in to build a
causeway (raised road). Construction was systematic. A dependable road requiring a
solid foundation. Roman roads were constructed with thick layers of tightly packed stones
and gravel sorted for size. The larger stones formed the bottom layer, while layers of
progressively smaller gravel filled in and leveled the roadbed. The final result was well
over 30 centimeters thick and resistant to the wear and tear of heavy traffic and severe
weather. More important roads were elevated above the surrounding land surface and
provided with ditches on both sides so that the road surface would never flood. Elevated
roads were so well fabricated, they did not collapse or become rutted even in the worst
rainy seasons. Upright curb stones buried in a line along the sides reinforced the road
surface, keeping it stable. These elevated roadbeds formed the original highways of
Britain and were much used until modern times.
Construction methods varied according to the official status of the planned road, but
certain techniques were distinctly Roman. The careful layering and tight packing of
selected gravels and other materials to form the roadbed is called metalling. Many
different materials were used, depending on their availability and suitability to local subsoil
conditions. Sand was added to keep the road from becoming too rigid and prone to
cracking. In areas where iron ore was smelted into iron, the rock-hard chunks of slag,
produced as a waste by-product during the smelting process, were added to the layering
material. The iron content of the slag pieces had the added value of rusting over time.
The rust would physically combine and harden with adjacent stones and sand to create
an extremely solid, concrete-like mass. Heavily used roads were resurfaced from time to
time. The final road metalling performed at the end of the fourth century sometimes
Page 175 of 269
resulted in a total road thickness of about a meter.
Roman roads in the fifth and sixth centuries continued to carry traffic, but roads did not
choose their travelers. Historians speculate that the existing road system enabled a quick
penetration of southeastern Britain by Germanic newcomers. The road system also
allowed the entire population of Britain to move about in response to foreign threats and
changing weather conditions. Townspeople left for the urban amenities of the European
continent. Merchants sought markets and customers in safer jurisdictions, while farmers
migrated to drier and warmer fields. The old Roman roads retained their importance in
successive medieval centuries, too. Even where they did not remain in use as roads, the
lines they imposed on the landscape often became boundaries for parishes and other
significant administrative or private land units. The well-known Roman highway Watling
Street in Northamptonshire now serves as the line for a number of modern administrative
boundaries.

43.2: Group Foraging
Bluegill sunfish obtain food by flushing (forcing into the open) small aquatic insects from
dense vegetation. Researcher Gary Mittelbach hypothesized that larger foraging (food
searching) groups might flush out more prey and increase the average number of prey
obtained per group member. He examined this hypothesis by experimentally manipulating
the foraging group size of bluegill sunfish in a controlled laboratory setting. Mittelbach
placed 300 small aquatic prey into a large aquarium containing juvenile bluegill sunfish.
He examined the success of bluegills that were foraging alone, in pairs, and in groups
(ranging from three to six bluegills). Mittelbach measured the number of prey captured
per bluegill, and he found a positive relationship between foraging group size and
individual foraging success (the larger the group, the greater the success) up to a group
size of four fish. The increased feeding rate per individual was due to two factors. First,
more prey were flushed when group size rose. Second, prey clumped together, so when
one group member found prey, others swam over to this area and then often found food
themselves.
While increased group size in bluegills does benefit each individual forager in its intake
of food (its per capita of foraging success), there is no evidence to suggest that bluegill
foragers hunt in any coordinated or cooperative fashion. The manner in which bluegills
increase foraging efficiency in larger groups (that is, by flushing) is only one means of
increased foraging efficiency through group living. For example, in a number of species,
increased group size reduces the amount of time that any given individual needs to devote
to antipredator activities-often, but not always, increasing per capita foraging success.
The general relationship between group size and foraging success uncovered by
Mittelbach has been found over and over in animal studies. For example, Scott Creel ran
an analysis on foraging success and group size in seven species that hunt in groups.
Overall, Creel found a strong positive relationship between per capita foraging success
and group size.
Individuals may cooperate with one another when hunting in groups. For example, when
wild dogs hunt down an animal, it is a coordinated effort, with different members of the
hunting pack playing different roles in the hunt: flushing the prey, making the initial attack,
killing the prey, and so forth. In such cases, it is useful to separate the effects of
cooperation from that of group size. To see how animal behaviorists disentangle such
effects, let us examine hunting behavior in chimps. Cooperative hunting, or the lack of it,
has been examined in chimp populations in the Gombe preserve in Tanzania, the Ma hale
Mountains in Tanzania, and the Tai National Park in the Ivory Coast. The most
comprehensive studies of cooperative hunting among chimps are those of Christophe
and Hedwige Boesch, who compared hunting patterns across the Gombe and Tai chimp
populations. Major differences in hunting strategies emerged between these populations.
In Tai chimps, a positive relationship was found between hunting success and group size
Page 177 of 269
in what is called a nonadditive fashion. That is, adding more hunters to a group did not
simply increase the amount of food by a fixed amount for each new hunter added. Rather,
with each new hunter, all group members received more additional food than they did
when the last new hunter was added to the group (up to a limit). In addition to these groupsize effects, Christophe Boesch found evidence of cooperation in Tai chimp hunting
behavior. Very complex, but subtle, social rules exist that regulate access to meat and
assure hunters—that is, those that actually cooperate during the hunt—-greater success
than those who fail to join a hunt.
The situation was quite different with Gombe chimps—there was no positive relationship
between group size and hunting success in chimps from this population. That is, no groupsize effect was uncovered in the context of obtaining food. In addition, unlike in the Tai
population, behavioral rules limiting a nonhunter's access to prey were absent, and such
individuals received as much food as those that hunted cooperatively. Part of the
difference in hunting behavior in Tai and Gombe chimps may be due to the fact that the
success rate for Gombe solo hunters was quite high compared with the individual success
rate for chimps in the Tai population.

44.1: Nutritional Changes in Human History
Although we now think of an optimal diet as one that promotes longevity (long life),
historically, our optimal diet was whatever made us strong enough to have healthy
children and then live long enough to help those children survive to do the same. The
best measure of good nutrition is average height, which is about 80 percent genetic but
is also strongly linked to childhood and adolescent calories and especially protein intake.
Although big and strong people might out-hunt, out-gather, and even out-fight their
smaller neighbors, they also need more calories. So people faced with chronic or
recurrent food shortages are better off if they are short and lean. The small bodies of lesswell-nourished humans are not only an effect of their lower intake of calories, protein, and
calcium but also protection against the likelihood of even lower intakes in the future. By
these metrics, our nomadic hunter-gatherer ancestors were remarkably well-nourished.
Remains from the Paleolithic Stone Age (2.6 mya to 10,000 ya) show that men had an
average height of about 179 cm (5 feet 10 inches) and an estimated weight of about 67
kg (148 pounds). The women were substantially smaller, averaging an estimated 157.5
cm (5 feet 2 inches) and 54 kg (119 pounds). After agriculture began about 10,000 years
ago, in the Neolithic era, humans actually got smaller. Archaeological evidence suggests
that the average Neolithic man was about 165 cm (5 feet 5 inches) tall and weighed 63
kg (139 pounds), while women were an average of 150 cm (4 feet 11 inches) and weighed
45 kg (99 pounds).
Paleolithic men were bigger than modern European men through the end of the
nineteenth century and were as big as they are today. And when the Europeans came to
North America, as supposedly well-nourished invaders from the most technologically
advanced countries in the world, the indigenous hunter-gatherer population of the
American plains was far taller than they were. Why would that be the case? It all came
down to nutrition. The plains diet of the hunter-gatherers centered around grass-fed wild
bison, whose meat was less fatty than meat from modern corn-fed animals. And the plains
tribes ate pretty much the whole animal. By comparison, even when agriculturalists' crops
provided enough calories to meet their energy requirements- -which probably were as
high if not higher than those of hunter-gatherers because farmers often worked every day
from dawn till dusk- they didn't provide as much protein or calcium as the huntergatherers' diets did. Even nuts generally have more protein per ounce than grains,
especially domesticated grains. This is why agriculturists also looked to legumes- -beans,
peas, and even peanuts- for their protein, much as modern vegetarians do. But it's a
challenge to get enough protein from nonanimal sources, and it was even harder in the
era before supermarkets.
Nutrition continues to correlate with human height today. The economist Richard Steckel
compared the height of people living in Europe from the ninth through the nineteenth
century by measuring the length of their thigh bones, or femurs, which account for about
25 percent of our height. He estimated that an average man in the early Middle Ages (5th10th century A.D.) stood 174 cm (5 feet 8/z inches). But by the seventeenth and
Page 179 of 269
eighteenth centuries, when more people lived in cities, where there was less vitamin D
(from exposure to sunlight) and fresh meat, the average man's height had declined to 167
cm (5 feet 5%4 inches)- a reduction of over 6 cm (2/z inches). And by the early twentyfirst century, better nutrition explains why the average height of young men in affluent
European countries increased to about 178 cm (5 feet 10 inches) on average.
In most societies, women are generally 10 to 13 cm (4 to 5 inches) shorter than men,
regardless of the height of the men. In this context, the 21.5 cm (8%2 inch) difference in
height between Paleolithic men and Paleolithic women was noticeably larger than the sex
difference we've seen ever since. This large difference may have been because
Paleolithic women didn't fully share in the protein bounty of the hunt, or perhaps became
pregnant at a younger age, when they were still growing, and their growth was stunted
by having to share their protein and calcium with a developing fetus.

44.2: Accounting for the High Density of Planet Mercury
Venus, Earth, and Mars are all thought to have formed from similar materials. Their iron
cores take up similar fractions of the planets, and their silicate mantles- -the mantle is the
layer of material between a planet's central core and its outer crust- -melt to produce
similar kinds of volcanic rocks. By contrast, Mercury, the smallest and closest to the Sun
of the four inner, or terrestrial planets, may have been formed from a different bulk
composition, or it may have formed under different conditions than the other terrestrial
planets. The planet has a huge iron core, indicating either that the planet contains at least
twice the iron content of the other terrestrial planets or that virtually all the iron from the
bulk composition was pulled into its core, leaving its mantle almost iron-free. At the same
time, the planet shows no recent volcanic activity, and so, unlike Venus, Earth, and Mars,
its interior can be assumed to be stationary. The lack of volcanic activity is usually taken
to mean that the planet has largely finished losing its internal heat. Mercury, however, has
a small magnetic field. Magnetic fields are generally accepted to be caused by fluid
movements in the mantle caused by heat loss. Somehow, Mercury has created a balance
that allows the generation of a magnetic field in the absence of mantle movements.
Mercury's average density is 341 pounds per cubic foot, just less than the densest planet,
Earth, at 347 pounds per cubic foot. The planet's high density was first discovered by
measuring the surprising acceleration of the Mariner mission toward Mercury in the grip
of the planet's strangely strong gravity field. Earth is a much larger planet, and so its
interior pressure is much higher, pressing the material into much denser forms. With the
effects of pressure taken away, Mercury's density is actually much higher than Earth's,
and it is, therefore, the densest planet in the solar system. The high density of the planet
is thought to imply that it contains a lot of iron-more, by proportion, than any other planet.
Iron is the most common dense inner solar system element, and it is likely to be
responsible for the high density in Mercury. If Mercury's extra density is due to iron
content, then Mercury has a core that is 60 percent or more by mass, the largest core
relative to the planetary radius of any planet in the solar system. Mercury's core is
probably 1,120 to 1,180 miles in radius, nearly 75 percent of the planet's diameter. This
is at least twice the metal content of Venus, Earth, or Mars.
Current models for planetary formation suggest that any terrestrial planet should form
with a large percentage of silicates, which would make up a thick mantle above the core,
as they do on Venus, Earth, and Mars. Mercury may have lost most of its silicate mantle
in some catastrophic event after its early formation. The simplest candidate for this event
is a giant impact. If a large body struck Mercury more or less directly, then its iron would
combine with Mercury's into an unusually large core, and much of Mercury's silicate
mantle could have been lost to space. The impacting body may also have been made
predominantly of metal, like an iron meteorite. In this scenario, the metal meteorite would
combine with the early, small Mercury, creating a planet with an unusually large iron core.
Alternatively, the silicate mantle could have been removed by vaporization in a burst of
heat from the early Sun. A third possibility is that there may have been a strong
Page 181 of 269
compositional variation in the early solar system and that, in fact, Mercury formed with
the iron-rich composition it now seems to possess. Finally, Mercury could have
differentiated in a particularly oxygen-poor environment. Without oxygen, iron will
preferentially form a metal and sink into the core rather than forming iron oxide and
combining into silicate mantle materials. In this scenario, Mercury could have started with
the same bulk composition and ended with its current structure without having endured a
giant impact.

45.1: Polar Dinosaurs
Once there was an idea that dinosaurs were cold-blooded and only thrived in the swamps
and wetlands of tropical climates. But the more we look, the more we realize dinosaurs
were found in as many different kinds of habitats as birds and mammals are today. Polar
dinosaurs, probably warm-blooded and feathery, were thriving roughly 70-100 million
years ago in great polar forests, of which there is no modem equivalent. Fossils of such
dinosaurs have been discovered in Siberia, specifically at the Kakanaut River on the
Kamchatka Peninsula. The dinosaur remains found here over the years are mostly teeth,
but also include some bones, and they reveal the presence of a variety of species. All of
these remains are from the very end of the Cretaceous, 66- 68 million years ago, just
before the mass extinction event that saw the extinction of the non-bird dinosaurs. "The
material was fragmentary but showed that the Arctic dinosaurs were very diverse," says
Pascal Godefroit, an expert on early birds and birdlike dinosaurs who has been involved
in the work at the Kakanaut River.
The Kakanaut finds have been important in understanding the end-Cretaceous extinction
event. This is in part because Kakanaut was within the Arctic Circle and just 1,600
kilometers from the North Pole at that time. Conditions then were warmer than today, but
mean annual temperatures were still around 10 degrees Celsius, and there would have
been frequent spells below freezing and many months of darkness. Dinosaur fossils found
farther east across the Bering Sea in Alaska were left by creatures that endured similar
climatic conditions, but some experts have argued that they migrated south in the winter
to avoid the coldest months. At Kakanaut, researchers found fragments of eggshell from
hadrosaur and theropod dinosaurs, which suggested that these animals were breeding in
polar regions and living there year-round.
Many scientists argue that the dinosaurs went extinct as a result of Earth's collision with
a massive asteroid or comet about 66 million years ago that created the Chicxulub Crater
on Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. Other scientists have claimed that falling global
temperatures had led to a decline in dinosaurs around the world in the period before the
impact (collision). However, the rich fauna (animal life) found by Godefroit and his
colleagues suggests that not only had a diverse ecosystem of dinosaurs persisted in the
Arctic in the late Cretaceous, but also that they were thriving in very cold conditions. The
herbivores here must have fed on plants, such as conifers, that remained green yearround and also taken advantage during summer months of a profusion of nutritious fresh
growth by plants bathing in light 24 hours a day.
"For the first time, we have firm evidence that these polar dinosaurs were able to
reproduce and live in these relatively cold regions. There is no way of knowing for sure,
but dinosaurs were probably warm-blooded just like modem birds, which are the direct
descendants of dinosaurs," Godefroit told reporters when his findings were published in
the German journal Naturwissenschaften in 2009. "The dinosaurs were incredibly diverse
in polar regions- as diverse as they were in tropical regions. It was a big surprise for us.”
Page 183 of 269
Rather than dinosaurs slowly dying out due to climate change in the period before the
impact, Godefroit believes that the discovery backs up the idea that dinosaurs were killed
off in a rapid and brutal fashion by cataclysmic conditions that swept the world following
the Chicxulub impact. Debris in the atmosphere may have blackened the skies for several
years, killing off plants and destroying the food supply- -particularly as large herbivores
(plant eaters), such as sauropod dinosaurs, required vast quantities of plant matter to fuel
their massive bulk. Starved for meat, the flesh eaters would eventually have succumbed
too, as herbivores disappeared.
It is likely that a combination of factors led to the demise of the non-bird dinosaurs, but
the precise explanation remains a fascinating and enduring mystery. It had been thought
that Siberia had a paucity of fossils in comparison to its southern neighbors, Mongolia
and China, but recent discoveries suggest this may not be true.

45.1: Dating the Arrival of Humans in North America
Developed in the mid-twentieth century by Willard Libby and Jim Arnold, radiocarbon
dating (used for dating organic materials) brought the chronology of North American
prehistory into sharp focus. The method provided accurate ages for the deposits of
organic material left behind by the last great ice sheets that covered the continent during
the Pleistocene Ice Age, that began approximately 1.6 million years ago. One such
deposit was determined to be 11,400 years old. Radiocarbon was also used to date the
traces (indications of their presence) left by America's earliest human inhabitants,
enabling scientists to map out the movements of people and glaciers and to investigate
the interrelationships between the two. Libby's first attempts to analyze an ancient North
American site included what archaeologists call the Folsom culture.
Folsom is a small town in northeastern New Mexico. In 1926-27, arrowhead-like stone
points were found there, mixed together with bones from a now-extinct type of bison, a
discovery that caused great excitement because it placed humans in New Mexico during
the last glacial period, when bison were abundant. Beyond that general observation,
however, there was no way to date the site. Eventually, additional "Folsom" sites were
discovered in other regions, all characterized by the same distinctive stone points. A few
of these were in places that could be correlated with specific glacial deposits, which,
through a fairly weak line of reasoning, were thought to be between 10,000 and 25,000
years old. Most workers favored the older end of the range.
Arnold and Libby included a charcoal sample linked to the Folsom culture in their first
published list of radiocarbon dates. The result was a surprise: 4,283 +/- 250 years B.P.
(before the present). This was clearly much younger than any of the earlier estimates
suggested, and if the date held up, it would mean that what appeared to be one of the
oldest Native American cultures was actually quite recent. Although they were confident
about their analysis procedures, Libby and Arnold were suspicious of the result and
wondered if the sample had been contaminated with young carbon, or if there was some
other difficulty they were unaware of. In the end, it turned out to be a classic case of
improper sampling, and an example of the importance of careful field documentation.
When the charcoal was collected in 1933 (it had been stored away from then until the
analysis), it appeared to be lying within a soil layer that contained both animal bones and
the distinctive Folsom stone points. But the unexpectedly young age prompted a
reexamination of the site, and it was determined that the charcoal came from a channel
that cut into and through the older layers. Although it appeared to be at the same level as
the bones and stone points, it was actually much younger. Once this problem was
recognized and new samples from this and other sites were analyzed, it became clear
that the most reliable Folsom ages fell in the range of 10,000 to 11,000 B.P.
However, it was also discovered that Folsom sites are not the oldest evidence of humans
in North America. At some localities, slightly different varieties of stone hunting points
occur; initially, it was thought that these were simply regional variations, or perhaps
Page 185 of 269
weapons used for hunting different types of animals. But, in some places- notably at
Clovis, New Mexico-they appear in layers that lie beneath the typical Folsom points. This
indicated that they were older, and soon, archaeologists began to distinguish between
Clovis and Folsom cultures. Obviously, Clovis sites became another target for
radiocarbon dating, and the results confirmed their antiquity. Clovis sites consistently
gave dates that were a few hundred years older than those characterized by the Folsom
artifacts, and there seemed to be little or no overlap between the two cultures.
With these results, the radiocarbon dates of both glacial deposits and archaeological sites
in North America seemed to be painting a consistent picture. As the last severe glaciation
of the Pleistocene Ice Age lost strength, early people spread into the United States. Clovis
people were the first widespread hunters, making distinctive stone points for their
weapons and hunting large game such as mammoths. Within a few hundred years,
however, a new culture appeared, making smaller and finer stone points and apparently
taking over from its Clovis predecessors as the dominant hunters in North America.

46.1: Industrialized Moths
When most people think of evolution, they imagine slow, incremental changes in a
population of plants or animals. But evolutionary changes can also appear suddenly. This
is illustrated by the most famous example of natural selection at work- the changing
coloration of the peppered moth (Biston betularia). The story of this population of lightcolored moths that turned dark and then light again in response to environmental change
is an elegant example of Darwinian evolution at work. What happened to the peppered
moth reminds us how easily populations can adapt to new conditions in times of
environmental stress.
The peppered moth, easily recognizable by its distinctive off-white wings peppered with
black specks, is common in England, where its preferred daytime environment is lightgrey, lichen-covered trees. The species, which includes a variety of color gradations from
dark to light, has always been popular with insect collectors because it's easy to preserve
and because the specimens generally maintain their color after death. Before 1850, most
of the specimens netted by English collectors were a speckled light grey-roughly the color
of the lichens (organisms that often cover the bark on trees). But then, the collectors
noticed a change: increasingly, the moths they captured had dark wings, and many of
them were almost totally black. British entomologists (scientists who study insects) were
fascinated by this rapid change in the peppered moth population, especially when they
realized that it was almost entirely restricted to polluted industrial areas. They began to
realize that what they were seeing was the process of evolution through natural selection.
Because the light grey moths resembled the lichens on the trees, they were relatively safe
from their main daytime predators, birds. But the darker moths were easy to see, and this
disadvantage limited the percentage of genes for dark coloration in the peppered moth
gene pool. When, in the mid-nineteenth century, industrial pollution in England began
turning the lichen on the tree trunks black, the darker moths were suddenly protected
while the light-colored moths became vulnerable. As more and more dark moths survived,
the gene pool shifted toward darker coloration. Similar examples of industrial melanism,
a darkening in color linked to a rise in industrialization, were identified in Europe, Japan,
the United States, and Canada.
For about a century, dark-peppered moths continued to dominate the populations. Then,
in the 1950s, scientists noticed that the gene pool was rapidly shifting back toward the
lighter coloration. As a result of antipollution legislation, the air was cleaner, the lichen on
the tree trunks was becoming lighter, and so were the moths. In fact, this second shift in
the gene pool was so radical that many entomologists believe the genes for dark
coloration may disappear completely, and that soon the dark-peppered moths will be
extinct.
The story of peppered moth evolution is so simple that many evolutionary biologists and
entomologists have wondered if it could possibly be true, and several of them have tested
Page 187 of 269
it. Although the results of their experiments have been reported in the popular press as
falsifying Darwinian evolution, what they actually revealed both supports the main points
of Darwinian evolution and emphasizes its complexity. The coloration of the peppered
moth population definitely shifted in response to environmental factors, but almost every
aspect of the process was more multifaceted than anyone thought. During the day,
peppered moths rest on a number of locations besides tree trunks. Moths' survival is less
dependent on their coloring than was originally assumed. It also turns out that the
changes in the peppered moth gene pool didn't parallel the changes in pollution levels as
closely as had been reported- -migration, as well as bird predation, also had an effect on
the ratio of dark to light forms. In short, far from illustrating the elegant simplicity of natural
selection, the story of the peppered moth highlights its elegant complexity, and reminds
us that even simple evolutionary changes aren't easy to trace.

46.2: Brick Technology in Mesopotamia
One of the earliest civilizations was that of Mesopotamia (part of the present-day Middle
East), including Sumer and Assyria. Some of its buildings survive to this day. Sun-dried
bricks made of mud and straw were its main building materials, as river mud was found
in abundance along the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers. Here, the scarcity of stone may have
been an incentive to develop the technology of making oven-fired bricks to use as an
alternative. To Strengthen walls made from sun-dried bricks, fired bricks began to be used
as an outer protective skin for more important buildings like temples, palaces, city walls,
and gates. Making fired bricks is an advanced pottery technique. Fired bricks are solid
masses of clay heated in ovens to temperatures of between 950 and 1,150 degrees
Celsius, and a well-made fired brick is an extremely durable object. Like sun-dried bricks,
they were made in wooden molds, but for bricks with decorations, special molds had to
be made. Unlike the river mud used for sun-dried bricks, the clay for proper bricks needed
to be carefully prepared, and building an oven, finding suitable fuel, and controlling oven
temperatures required a professional level of skill and know-how. This is perhaps the
reason why the use of fired bricks came in gradually over time.
The technical complexities involved in making fired bricks may explain why one of the first
recorded instances of pieces of fired clay, used as a protective covering for mud-brick
walls at the Sumerian city of Uruk in southern Mesopotamia in 3600- 3200 B.C., did not
involve bricks but small clay cones. Uruk was one of Mesopotamia's first cities and had
an important temple complex at its center, known as the Eanna precinct. Here was found
the Limestone Temple, which was connected to a second temple via a courtyard. In this
courtyard was a terrace with massive pillars made of mud and bundled reeds. To protect
them from weathering, thousands of nail-shaped ceramic cones were pushed into an
outer bed of clay. The cones have flat tops and were painted red, white, or black and
arranged in such a way that they formed geometric patterns. What is so significant about
this is that here we find, perhaps for the first time, fired clay as a practical protection
against the environmental effects of rain and wind, safeguarding the columns from
deterioration as well as creating an ornamental surface decoration.
Over time, fired bricks also came to be used in Uruk as a building material and for
decorative purposes. An example is the temple of Inanna, the goddess of fertility, built by
King Karaindash at the end of the fourteenth century B.C. The exterior of the temple was
constructed of fired bricks with alternating projections (structures extending from the
temple) and recessions (hollow areas). In the recessions were brick statues of gods
holding vessels from which flowed streams of water.
Assyrian kings used fired bricks for the construction of ziggurats (a series of rectangular
terraces of decreasing size), palaces, and gateways. Some fine examples have survived
from the city of Nimrud in northern Mesopotamia, where in the ninth century B.C., temples
and palaces were decorated with fired bricks during the reigns of the Neo-Assyrian kings
Ashumasirpal II (883- 859 B.C.) and Shalmaneser III (859- -840 B.C.). A glazed tile was
Page 189 of 269
found at Nimrud at one of the palaces, which shows a king attended by servants and
bodyguards, and probably represents Ashumasirpal II, who rebuilt Nimrud during his
reign. Similar compositions of Assyrian kings attended by their servants can also be found
on stone-relief carvings of that time.
Bricks with cuneiform script provide important written information about the history of the
period. Cuneiform is the oldest known form of writing and dates from around 3200 B.C.
Text was imprinted with a small stick or reed pen into the soft clay, which was then left to
harden in the sun, or sometimes fired to become a permanent record of the royal,
religious, military, or economic history of the various Mesopotamian kingdoms. Cuneiform
became the basis for all subsequent Sumerian, Akkadian, Assyrian, Babylonian, and
Persian writing. It was frequently used to record royal deeds, as on the clay tablets
excavated at the ziggurat attached to the temple of the god Ninurta, a prominent building
in Nimrud.

47.1: The Early History of Jupiter
The Sun and all planets in the solar system formed from the same cloud of interstellar
material known as the solar nebula. However, the size and composition of the four outer
Jovian planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) radically differ from those of the
four terrestrial planets, which are closest to the Sun (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars).
Whereas the inner planets are composed mainly of heavier elements, the Jovian planets
are much larger and contain a much higher proportion of the light gases hydrogen and
helium. Jupiter, with its mass of around 300 times that of Earth, is the largest planet in the
solar system and is the closest Jovian planet to the Sun.
It is generally believed that Jupiter's formation began with the accretion (the coming
together of material under the influence of gravitation) of a solid core. This core grew by
collision and sticking of dust, ice, rocks, and larger bodies- -a process similar to the
accretion of Earth. Jupiter, however, formed outside, or beyond, the “snow line," a special
place in the solar system where water vapor condensed (solidified) to form ice grains,
and the presence of “snow" in this region would enhance the density of solid matter and
accelerate the accretion process. The mystery is why the proto-Jupiter (early Jupiter)
grew so rapidly. Apparently, Jupiter grew to a mass of 15 Earths before Mars grew to 10
percent of an Earth mass. Planetary scientist David Stevenson has suggested that
outward migration of water vapor and condensation at the “snow line" may have provided
larger concentrations of solid matter at this location, thus speeding up the formation of
the early Jupiter.
Jupiter's growth into a giant planet began when the rock-ice core mass reached 15 Earth
masses. At this mass, the gravity of the core can pull in and hold hydrogen and helium,
the light gases that account for 99 percent of the mass of the nebula. When this gas
accretion process begins, it is very dramatic because the rate of accretion of gas is
proportional to the square of the mass already accreted. In other words, the bigger it gets,
the faster it grows. If gas could be continually fed to it, it would consume the Universe in
a relatively short time! What actually happens is that Jovian planet formation depletes its
feeding zone (the area from which a forming planet can accumulate material) of matter,
which, in turn, truncates planet formation. And although the general properties of this
process might be modeled, it just seems to have been by chance that our Jupiter formed
as it did.
Because Jupiter's gravity efficiently scatters bodies that approach it, it cleans our solar
system of dangerous Earth orbit-crossing asteroids and comets (objects orbiting the Sun
that are smaller than planets), thus having a beneficial influence on life on Earth. However,
it appears that we have been quite lucky that Jupiter in our solar system has maintained
a stable orbit around the Sun. A Jupiter and a giant neighbor like Saturn (the second
planet outside the “snow line" and the second largest in the solar system) are a potentially
deadly couple that can lead to disastrous situations where a planetary system can literally
be torn apart. Recently, it has become possible to use powerful computers to determine
Page 191 of 269
the stability of the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn over the lifetime of the planetary system.
There are minor chaotic changes but no major changes, and the solar system, at least to
a first approximation, is stable over its lifetime. However, this would not be the case if
either Jupiter or Saturn were more massive or if the two were closer together. It would
also be dangerous to have a third Jupiter-sized planet in a planetary system. In an
unstable system, the results can be catastrophic.
Gravitational perturbations (destabilizing interactions) among the planets can radically
change orbits, making them noncircular. Although instability might start with just two
planets, the effects would spread to them all, and the resulting repeated changes in
distance between a planet and the central star would prevent any of them from having
the persistence of conditions required for a stable atmosphere, ocean, and complex life,
such as plants and animals.

47.2: The Economic and Cultural Impact of Plant Diseases
Plant diseases have affected people for as long as humans have grown crops. The
ancient Romans even had a god, Robigus, whom they needed to placate in hopes of
preventing wheat rust, a disease caused by a fungus that affects wheat, barley, and rye
stems, which can cause a significant decrease in crop yield. Probably the most famous
example of a plant disease was the late blight of potatoes, which devastated the potato
crop in Europe and especially Ireland in the mid-nineteenth century. A large proportion of
the people in Ireland were completely dependent on potatoes for subsistence, and as a
result of the blight, Ireland lost about a quarter of its population to famine and emigration.
It is now known that plant diseases are caused by the same types of organisms, or
pathogens, that cause human and animal diseases, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses.
The discovery of evidence that plant diseases are caused by microscopic organisms was
contemporary to discoveries substantiating the theory that infectious animal diseases are
caused by microbes. In 1878, fire blight, a disease of pears and apples, was determined
to be caused by a bacterium, a discovery that came only two years after the German
physician Robert Koch had confirmed that anthrax, a disease of livestock, is caused by a
bacterium. The first evidence that infection with a virus, a pathogen smaller than bacteria,
can result in disease came from an experiment with the tobacco mosaic virus, which can
infect tobacco as well as tomato plants. The experiment, which was performed in the
1890s, showed that sap from a diseased tobacco plant was still infectious after having
been passed through a filter with pore sizes small enough to prevent the passage of
bacterial cells.
Some plant pathogens, such as the organism responsible for cedar-apple rust, must infect
an intermediate, or alternate host before they can complete their life cycle on the
economically important host (in this case, the apple). For this disease, the alternate host
is red cedar, on which the fungus overwinters. Therefore, the elimination of red cedar
trees was advocated to help reduce the incidence of the disease. These kinds of
relationships with intermediate hosts are not unique to agents infecting plants. Both yellow
fever and malaria require an incubation period of roughly ten days in the mosquitoes that
transmit them before infection of new human hosts can occur.
Perhaps the most bizarre example of a plant disease affecting the economy of a country
was the appearance of streaks or featherings of darker colors on a lighter-colored
background in tulip flowers in Holland. These symptoms became known as color
breaking. The bulbs of these tulips, which in reality were infected by a plant virus, became
highly prized. Prices for these infected bulbs initially skyrocketed but then suddenly fell in
1637, resulting in the collapse of Holland's economy, which had become excessively
dependent on tulip exports. The coffee rust outbreak and its aftermath in Ceylon (now Sri
Lanka) in 1875 had a lasting cultural impact. Ceylon had come under British control about
50 years earlier, and most of the island consisted of coffee plantations. The coffee rust
fungus destroyed the coffee plants, and the plantations switched to growing tea bushes.
Page 193 of 269
As a result, drinking tea became an integral part of British culture.
Prevention of plant diseases is achieved by several methods, such as chemical treatment
and altering the plants' genes to make them disease resistant. The first chemical
treatment was discovered in the nineteenth century when botanist Pierre-Marie- Alexis
Millardet was studying an outbreak of downy mildew, a devastating disease of grapes, in
vineyards in the Bordeaux region of France. During his investigation, he noted that even
in infected fields, vines closest to the road were not affected by mildew. He eventually
learned that farmers had sprayed the vines near the road with a visible and bitter-tasting
mixture of copper sulfate and lime so that passersby would not eat the grapes. Soon this
mixture, known as the Bordeaux mixture, became a common means of preventing downy
mildew.

48.1: Shoaling Behavior
A shoal is any group of fish that remain together for social reasons. A shoal may be a
school (a coordinated group with synchronized movements) at some times and a less
organized mass at others. Shoaling is of considerable interest because of its prevalence,
and various hypotheses have been put forward to explain it: increased efficiency of
movement in water (hydrodynamic efficiency), increased efficiency of food finding,
reproductive success, and reduced risk of predation.
The idea that shoaling increases the efficiency of swimming applies mainly to schooling.
This idea is very appealing, both because of the regular spacing that seems to
characterize fish in schools and because fish in shoals tend to be uniform in size. To gain
hydrodynamic advantages, however, each fish must maintain rather precise positioning
within a school to use the hydrodynamic lift created by its neighbors. By and large,
measurements of fish positions within schools in the laboratory have not found this to be
true. Nevertheless, the regular spacing of fish in schools observed in the wild indicates
that being in a school probably does have a hydrodynamic advantage- -at least for fish
that are behind other fish. Some scientists argue that the leadership of a school is
constantly changing, because while being immersed in a school incurs hydrodynamic
advantages to individuals, leaders of schools are first to find food, which is also
advantageous.
Schooling by predators increases the probability of their detecting a school of prey, just
as shoaling in planktivores (fish that feed on plankton, the very small plants and animals
in the water) increases the probability of detecting suitable patches of plankton. The
reason for this is the presence of many searching eyes over a large area. Fish in shoals
share information by monitoring each other's behavior. Feeding behavior in one fish
quickly stimulates food-searching behavior in others. For planktivores, however, this
advantage may be decreased by having to share the patch with many other fish: fish in
the rear of a school are likely to encounter much lower densities of plankton than those
in the front as well as higher concentrations of waste products from their schoolmates.
For fish that shoal throughout their lifetimes, little energy has to be expended in finding a
mate when spawning time comes. Presumably, shoaling also allows fish to closely
synchronize their reproductive cycles (through behavioral and hormonal cues). In
addition, for fish that migrate long distances to breed, schooling may increase the
accuracy of finding the way home, because the average direction sought by fish in a
school is likely to be a better choice than that chosen by an individual migrating alone.
For tunas, with habitual migration routes, this means that groups of individuals may stay
together for long periods.
Shoaling reduces predation risk in two main interacting ways: by confusing predators and
by providing safety in numbers. When predators attack, large shoals are particularly
advantageous because of the reduced probability that any one individual will be eaten; in
Page 195 of 269
any given attack, a smaller percentage of a large shoal will be eaten compared to a small
shoal. The confusion effect is based on the common observation that shoaling fish tend
to get eaten mostly when they have been separated from the shoal; many attack
strategies of predators can thus be best interpreted as efforts to break up shoals so that
individuals can be picked off. Shoaling fish are the same size and silvery, so it is difficult
for a visually oriented predator to pick an individual out of a mass of twisting, flashing fish
and then have enough time to grab its prey before it disappears into the shoal. Shoaling
fishes also are fairly uniform in size and appearance, a further factor confusing predators.
Individuals that stand out (for example, because of heavy parasite infestations) are
quickly picked off. Even when shoals are made of several species, individual fish are
similar in size, although the species may remain segregated within the school. Thus, it
has been noted that banded killifish, golden shiner, and white sucker shoal together, but
that the killifish occupy the top of the shoal, the shiners the middle, and the suckers the
bottom.
These shoal positions reflect the preferred feeding areas of the three species (surface,
mid-water, and bottom, respectively).

48.2: Pleistocene Overkill
Around 11,000 years ago, near the end of the Pleistocene era (2.6 million to 11,700 years
ago), most megafauna -large, mostly herbivorous (plant-eating) land animals- went
extinct in North America. Their disappearance has been the topic of much debate, but
considerable evidence supports a hypothesis known as “Pleistocene overkill." The idea
is that, as humans spread across the continent, they preyed upon large herbivores, such
as woolly mammoths, ground sloths, and tortoises, and wiped them out. As originally
formulated by the American geoscientist Paul Martin, the large mammals were driven to
extinction in a few hundred years in a massive, fast-moving event. A newer version of the
hypothesis posits that the extinctions were more gradual, based on evidence that, in some
areas, humans and large animals coexisted in the same habitats for long periods of time,
despite hunting. However, the end result was the same: the extinction of the megafauna.
Large animals are more vulnerable to extinction than smaller ones because they cannot
hide easily from human predators and because they reproduce quite slowly. It is possible
that the large animals were also relatively unafraid of human beings since they would
have evolved for hundreds of thousands of years without humans present. In addition,
there is some indication that a rapid shift in climate reduced the habitats of many of the
giant herbivores, making them more vulnerable to human predation. Likewise, Australian
biologist Tim Flannery suggests humans may have changed the environment through
their actions, especially by increasing the frequency of fires.
Not unexpectedly, when the large herbivores disappeared, their natural predators, such
as saber-toothed tigers and short-nosed bears, became extinct as well. The large
scavenger birds, which had adapted to eating the remains of large animals, also followed
them into extinction. The California condor may have held on because it had access to
the carcasses of large marine mammals, such as whales and sea lions, which did not go
extinct at this time. The loss of these giant animals also impacted the diversity of smaller
animals. Because abundant large animals (such as mammoths and tapirs) alter plant
communities by the way they graze (feed on plants), their disappearance would have
caused a shift in the plant communities, resulting in the extinction of many smaller species
that depended on the habitats maintained by the large grazers. In fact, there existed a
grassland ecosystem in Alaska called the mammoth steppe that disappeared entirely
once the woolly mammoth went extinct in that region.
The idea of the Pleistocene overkill is quite controversial, yet the principal alternative to
explain the rapid loss of all these giant animals is a drastic climate change that occurred
when the last ice age ended near the end of the Pleistocene. Recent fossil data and
archeological discoveries increasingly support the idea that the early native people were
responsible for the extinction of many species. One of the early groups (but not the first)
to colonize North America was the Clovis people. At Clovis archeological sites,
researchers have found distinctive, beautifully made stone spearheads that would have
been well-suited to killing large herbivores. These same Clovis spearheads have been
found embedded in the skeletons of large animals, which strongly suggests that these
Page 197 of 269
animals were hunted by the Clovis people. Clovis culture rapidly spread throughout North
America, and then abruptly disappeared after about 300 years- -a disappearance that
seems to coincide with the extinction of many (but not all) of the large animals of interior
North America.
Additional support for the overkill idea comes from the growth rings of mammoth tusks at
the time of the mammoths' extinction, which indicate that the animals were eating well
and not experiencing the starvation that would normally accompany climate-driven
extinction. Also, many of the extinct species of megafauna had already survived several
other glacial climate cycles during the previous 100,000 years, and so presumably, they
could have survived one more. It is worth noting that a similar event occurred in Australia,
with early human societies apparently wiping out many species of giant marsupials, as
well as on islands throughout the world. If we accept some version of the Pleistocene
overkill hypothesis, then we also have to accept the idea that early hunter-gatherer
societies were capable of having large and permanent effects on their environment.

49.1: The Absence of Snakes in Ireland
According to legend, lreland in northern Europe has no snakes because a fifth-century
monk named Patrick drove the island's snakes into the sea. In reality, lreland has no
snakes because of the interplay between organisms and their physical environment.
Snakes, like all reptiles and amphibians, are ectotherms (cold-blooded): their body
temperature and functionality are dictated by the temperature of their external
environment. Species diversity of reptiles decreases rapidly from the equator toward the
higher latitudes. In North America, the number of lizard species is highest in the warm
desert regions of the southwest and declines continuously as you move northward. The
same pattern of species diversity is evident in Europe, where the number of reptile
species declines markedly as you move from the warmer Mediterranean coast toward
northern Europe and the British Isles. Although one snake species, the European adder
(viper), is found above the Arctic Circle in Scandinavia, its unusually northern distribution
comes at a cost. The adder has a very limited period of activity, often only three to four
months a year. In addition, the species may take up to four years to attain sexual maturity,
and females may breed only once every three or four years, using the intervening period
to build up the fat reserves necessary to produce offspring.
The progressive decline in solar radiation and temperatures from the tropics to the poles
not only reduces the abundance and diversity of reptiles but also has a direct influence
on their body size. The reason for these patterns is that heat exchange occurs across the
surface of a body, but warming usually occurs throughout the entire body's mass or
volume. Large bodies, because of their low surface area to volume ratio, take longer to
warm than smaller ones. This physical reality results in upper limits to the size of snakes
(and other reptiles) depending on the distance of the snake's habitat from the tropics. All
of the large snakes, such as the anaconda and python, are found within the tropic and
subtropical regions. Other large reptiles- such as the iguanas, monitor lizards, and the
crocodilians (alligators, caimans, and crocodiles)- -are likewise limited in their distribution
to the warm, aseasonal environments of the subtropics and tropics. The maximum body
size for ectotherms declines as you move north and south from the equator. This pattern
is the exact opposite of that observed for endotherms (warm-blooded animals), where
average body size increases from the tropics to the poles, a pattern referred to as
Bergmann's rule. The environmental constraint on the upper limit of body size for
ectotherms is at the very heart of the current debate over whether the dinosaurs were
cold- or warm-blooded. The fossil record places the dinosaurs well into the northern
latitudes, with specimens found in Alaska and Siberia.
As for snakes, the fossil record reveals that the diversity of reptiles and amphibians
(terrestrial ectotherms) has always been low in northern Europe. During the Pleistocene
epoch (from 2.6 million to 11,700 years ago), a time when the temperature of Earth was
considerably lower than that now observed, much of the Northern Hemisphere was
covered by glaciers. Although certain refugia (small pockets of land not covered by ice)
Page 199 of 269
existed, the massive ice sheet virtually obliterated all life in northern Europe, including
Ireland and Britain. As temperatures rose and the glaciers retreated during the Holocene
epoch (11,700 years to the present), the region was recolonized by plants and animals,
but the cool temperatures of northern Europe proved inhospitable to most snakes.
Nevertheless, the island of Britain, similar in climate to lreland, ended up with three
species of snakes that survive there to this day.
Three species of snakes is a paltry sum, but nonetheless, it is more than lreland has. Why
the difference? After the retreat of the continental glaciers at the end of the last ice age,
Britain had a land bridge connecting it with the mainland of Europe, whereas Ireland did
not. The limited diversity of snakes on the mainland meant that the pool of species
available to recolonize both Britain and Ireland was small in the first place. However,
lreland's lack of a land bridge with continental Europe, coupled with the limited dispersal
abilities of most snake species, have to date, prohibited their successful recolonization
there.

49.2: Early European Tapestries
Tapestries, handwoven textiles made with different colored threads to produce designs or
images, were highly popular in Western and northern Europe between the thirteenth and
seventeenth centuries. The nobility at the time usually lived in big, austere, drafty castles,
and tapestries provided comfort and warmth. They could be hung on cold walls or used
to cover doors and windows. Noble families often did not have a permanent home, instead
moving periodically among several locations. Tapestries, which were expensive, were
usually packed and moved each time, bringing with them a sense of luxury and familiarity.
Some of the most famous tapestries were woven from wool in Flanders (modern
Belgium), a region well-placed for tapestry production. Many of the plants that supplied
dyes grew there. The leaves of the woad plant were used to make blue, and the madder
root provided red. Yellow came from different materials, including onion skins and lemon
peels, though most of these yellows faded quickly, thus also affecting the quality of green,
which is a mixture of blue and yellow. High-quality wool was not produced in Flanders but
was readily imported from nearby England.
Because of a long history of textile production, Flanders already boasted many skilled
weavers and dyers when tapestry production began to increase, and this advantage grew
in the late fifteenth century because of unrest in Flanders' southern neighbor, France.
Originally, Paris had been a center of tapestry production, but the turmoil produced by the
Hundred Years' War between England and France (1337- 1453) caused many textile
workers to relocate to Flanders or to the city of Arras, which was then a part of the Duchy
of Burgundy. Following the death of the Duke of Burgundy in 1477, the French king Louis
XI conquered the territories around Arras. Its inhabitants, still loyal to Burgundy, then
expelled all the French who had lived in the city. In retaliation, Louis attacked the town
and, in turn, expelled the inhabitants loyal to Burgundy, including the textile workers, many
of whom fled to Flanders. Paris regained some of its strength in tapestry production in the
seventeenth century when Louis XIV established the famed Gobelins workshops there.
Tapestries were initially used mostly for warmth, but their visual aspect later gained
importance. Tapestries often tell a story. Many early tapestries were hung in churches and
cathedrals; these often featured biblical scenes and were used for teaching or religious
devotion. However, the use of tapestries in churches later declined with the rise of Gothic
architecture. Because this new style emphasized light, churches had many more windows
than before, reducing the space for tapestries. In homes, tapestries were still prized; they
tended to show complex, varied scenes in vivid colors and provided visual unity to rooms.
Historical or mythical scenes were popular, including depictions of heroes and heroines
from Greek mythology and figures from European legend. Among the most famous
tapestries is a set of six called The Lady and the Unicorn， now in the Cluny Museum in
Paris. These tapestries, done in the intricate millefleurs design (with a background of
many small flowers), all show an elegant lady accompanied by a unicorn and a lion. Five
of them likely represented the senses, but the meaning of the sixth, bearing an inscription
Page 201 of 269
sometimes translated as“my sole desire," is debatable.
Tapestries were often used as symbols of power and success. A nobleman would
sometimes commission a tapestry showing historical or mythical scenes that lent his
family legitimacy or commemorated a battle his family had won. Because these tapestry
pieces declared status, they were often finer than other kinds of tapestries, sometimes
made with gold or silver thread. One magnificent group of tapestries, called the
Apocalypse of Angers, was commissioned by the Duke of Anjou (France) in 1375. In
Christian narratives, the Apocalypse is the final battle between good and evil, which is
symbolized in the tapestry by various images, like battles between angels and beasts.
Some of the angels are holding flags showing the Cross of Anjou, a symbol of the duke's
territory. The tapestries were probably designed to represent the duke's wealth as well as
to reinforce his authority as a ruler.

50.1: Sexual Dimorphism in Lamprologus Callipterus
Lamprologus callipterus is one of over 300 species of cichlid (a freshwater fish) found
only in Lake Tanganyika in Africa. Most African cichlids, including L.callipterus, exhibit
sexual size dimorphism-the males are larger than the females. What is unusual about
L.callipterus is the magnitude of the size difference. The key to understanding the sexual
dimorphism of L.callipterus lies in the reproductive behavior of the species, particularly
spawning (release of eggs by females and release of sperm by males) and brooding
(protection of eggs). Female L.callipterus spawn and brood their eggs in empty snail
shells on the lake bottom. In all other shell-brooding cichlids, both sexes enter the shell
to spawn, and thus, both must be small enough to fit into the shells available on the lake
bottom. In L.callipterus, however, only the females enter the shell to spawn and brood
their eggs. The males remain outside, releasing their sperm only at the entrance to the
shell. Consequently, female L.callipterus are small enough to fit into the shells, but the
males, unconstrained by the need to enter shells, are much larger.
Spawning and brooding inside shells puts females in an evolutionary dilemma with
respect to their body size. In cichlids, as in most fishes, the number of eggs spawned per
batch (the fecundity) increases with female body size, and this favors females that grow
large. In L.callipterus, the correlation between female length and the number of eggs
spawned is as high as 0.95, which means that more than 90 percent of the variation in
fecundity among females can be explained by differences in body length. Further,
because fecundity is more a function of body volume than length, it increases
disproportionally as body length increases. In one study, for example, an increase in
female length from 3 centimeters to 4 centimeters was associated with an increase in
fecundity from 59 to 134 eggs. In addition to this huge fecundity boost, larger females are
able to exclude smaller females from access to the larger, preferred shells and so gain in
the competition for spawning sites. All this suggests that female L.callipterus should be
large, but this is where the dilemma comes in. No matter how beneficial the large size
might be, the scarcity of large shells ultimately limits the size that females attain in a given
population. In laboratory experiments, females actually adjust their growth rates so that
their body size at maturity matches that of the available shells, and in the wild, the
correlation between shell size and female size explains more than 98 percent of the
variation in female size among populations. The ultimate size of female L.callipterus is
thus a compromise between growing as large as possible to maximize fecundity and
remaining small enough to be able to find suitable shells for spawning and brooding their
young.
Finding shells large enough for brooding is so critical for female L.callipterus that, when
they are ready to spawn, they generally pay more attention to choosing shells than to
choosing mates. Males have adopted a unique strategy to exploit this female choosiness.
Rather than trying to attract females from afar with flamboyant displays, male L.callipterus
entice females to mate with them by assembling piles of empty snail shells. They set up
small territories, less than a meter in diameter, and each territory is centered on a patch
Page 203 of 269
of shells. In most areas of the lake, these patches of shells are separated by stretches of
sandy or rocky bottom devoid of shells. The males create this patchy distribution by
picking up and carrying shells from as far away as 20 meters. In addition to clearing the
surrounding area of abandoned shells, territorial males frequently steal shells from the
shell piles of other males, sometimes with females and offspring inside. When this
happens, the female and her offspring usually disappear, and the empty shell becomes
available for a new female in the territory of the male relocating the shell. The effect of
this remarkable shell transporting is to create artificial clumps of shells surrounded by
unsuitable stretches of lake bottom. When females are ready to spawn, they have to visit
the shell piles of territorial males to find suitable shells, thus creating spawning
opportunities for males.

50.2: Weather Forecasting
Because the many variables that affect weather are constantly changing, meteorologists
have used high-speed computers to devise atmospheric models that describe the present
state of the atmosphere. These are not physical models that paint a picture of a
developing storm; they are, rather, mathematical models consisting of dozens of
mathematical equations that describe how atmospheric pressure, winds, and moisture
will change with time. Actually, the models do not fully represent the real atmosphere but
are approximations formulated to retain the most important aspects of the atmosphere' s
behavior.
Computer-generated forecast charts using these models to interpret recorded weather
data are known as prognostic charts, or simply progs. At present, there are a variety of
models, and hence progs, from which to choose. One model may work best in predicting
the position of troughs (elongated areas of low barometric pressure) in the upper
atmosphere. Another may forecast the position of surface lows quite well. And some
models even forecast the state of the atmosphere 384 hours (16 days) into the future.
A good forecaster knows the idiosyncrasies of each model and carefully scrutinizes all
the progs. The forecaster then makes a prediction based on the guidance of the computer.
This prediction is a personalized practical interpretation of the weather situation given the
local geographic features that influence the weather within the specific forecast area.
Since the forecaster has access to hundreds of weather maps each day, why is it that
forecasts are sometimes wrong?
Unfortunately, there are flaws inherent in computer models that limit the accuracy of
weather forecasts. Computer-forecast models idealize the real atmosphere, meaning that
each model makes certain assumptions about the atmosphere that may be accurate for
some weather situations and be way off for others, so a forecaster who bases a prediction
on an inaccurate prog may find a forecast of rain and wind turning out to be a day of clear
and colder weather.
Another forecasting problem arises because the majority of models are not global in their
coverage, and errors are able to creep in along a regional model's boundaries. A model
that predicts the weather for North America may not accurately treat weather systems that
move in along its boundary from the Pacific Ocean. Obviously, a good global model of
similar sophistication would require an incredible number of computations.
Even though many thousands of weather observations are taken worldwide each day,
there are still regions where observations are sparse, particularly over the oceans and at
higher latitudes. Temperature data recorded by satellites have helped to alleviate this
problem, as the newest satellites are able to provide a more accurate profile of
temperature for computer models. Since the computer's forecast is only as good as the
data fed into it and since observing stations may be so far apart that they miss certain
weather features, a denser network of observations is needed, especially in remote areas,
Page 205 of 269
to ensure better forecasts in the future.
Another forecasting problem is that computer models cannot adequately interpret many
of the factors that influence surface weather, such as the interactions of water, ice, and
local terrain on weather systems. Some models do take large geographic features such
as mountain chains and oceans into account, while ignoring smaller features such as hills
and lakes. These smaller features can have a marked influence on the local weather.
Given the effect of local terrain, as well as the impact of some of the other problems
previously mentioned, computer forecasts presently do an inadequate job of predicting
local weather conditions, such as surface temperatures, winds, and precipitation.
Even with a denser network of observing stations and near-perfect computer models,
there are countless small, unpredictable atmospheric fluctuations that fall under the
heading of chaos. These small disturbances, as well as small errors (uncertainties) in the
data, generally amplify with time as the computer tries to project the weather further and
further into the future. After a number of days, these initial imperfections (errors) tend to
dominate, and the forecast shows little or no skill in predicting the behavior of the real
atmosphere.

51.1: Class Structures in Postwar Europe
Rapid economic growth went a long way toward creating a new society in Europe after
the Second World War. European society became more mobile and more democratic. Old
class barriers relaxed, and class distinctions became fuzzier.
Changes in the structure of the middle class were particularly influential in the general
drift toward a less rigid class structure. In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries,
the model for the middle class had been the independent, self-employed individual who
owned a business or practiced a liberal profession such as law or medicine. Ownership
of property- -very often inherited property- -and strong family ties had often been the keys
to wealth and standing within the middle class. After 1945, this pattern declined drastically
in Western Europe. A new breed of managers and experts replaced traditional property
owners as the leaders of the middle class. The ability to serve the needs of a big
organization largely replaced inherited property and family connections in determining an
individual's social position in the middle and upper-middle classes. At the same time, the
middle class grew massively and became harder to define.
There were several reasons for these developments. The rapid industrial and
technological expansion created a powerful demand for technologists and managers in
large corporations and government agencies. Moreover, the old propertied middle class
lost control of many family-owned businesses, and many small businesses simply went
out of existence as their former owners joined the ranks of salaried employees. Top
managers and ranking civil servants, therefore, represented the model for a new middle
class of salaried specialists. Well-paid and highly trained, often with backgrounds in
engineering or accounting, these experts increasingly came from all social classes, even
the working class. Pragmatic and realistic, they were primarily concerned with efficiency
and practical solutions to concrete problems. Managers and technocrats, of whom a small
but growing number were women, could pass on the opportunity for all-important
advanced education to their children, but only in rare instances could they pass on the
positions they had attained. Thus the new middle class, which was based largely on
specialized skills and high levels of education, was more open, democratic, and insecure
than the old propertied middle class.
The structure of the lower classes also became more flexible and open. There was a
mass exodus from farms and the countryside, as one of the most traditional and least
mobile groups in European society drastically declined. Meanwhile, the industrial working
class ceased to expand, and job opportunities for white-collar and service employees
grew rapidly. Such employees bore a greater resemblance to the new middle class of
salaried specialists than to industrial workers, who were also better educated and more
specialized.
European governments were reducing class tensions with a series of social security
reforms. Many of these reforms -such as increased unemployment benefits and more
Page 207 of 269
extensive retirement pensions- simply strengthened social security measures first
pioneered in Germany before the First World War. Other programs were new, such as
comprehensive national health systems directed by the state. Most countries also
introduced family allowances - direct government grants to parents to help them raise
their children. These allowances helped many low-income families make ends meet. Most
European governments also gave maternity grants and built inexpensive public housing
for low-income families and individuals. These and other social reforms provided a
humane level of well-being. Reforms also promoted greater equality because they were
paid for in part by higher taxes on the rich.
The rising standard of living and the spread of standardized consumer goods also worked
to level European society, as the percent of income spent on food and drink declined
substantially. For example, the European automotive industry expanded phenomenally
after lagging far behind the United States since the 1920s. In 1948, there were only 5
million cars in Western Europe, but in 1965, there were 44 million. Car ownership was
democratized and came within the range of better-paid workers. Europeans took great
pleasure in the products of the gadget revolution as well. Like Americans, Europeans filled
their houses and apartments with washing machines, vacuum cleaners, refrigerators,
dishwashers, radios, televisions, and stereos. The purchase of consumer goods was
greatly facilitated by installment purchasing, which allowed people to buy on credit. With
the expansion of social security safeguards, reducing the need to accumulate savings for
hard times, ordinary people were increasingly willing to take on debt.

51.2: What Made Venetian Art Different
Venice was a major center for art in the Renaissance, yet it produced a style of art and
architecture markedly different from that of other Italian cities like Rome or Florence. It
owed this uniqueness to a thriving commercial empire: between the ninth and fifteenth
centuries, Venice gained control over Mediterranean shipping and so became the most
important market for goods from all over the known world. Because of the presence of
traders and immigrants from far and wide and the experiences of its own merchants and
diplomats, Venice benefitted from a huge range of cultural influences on its art and
architecture.
Perhaps the biggest external influence on Venice was the East-Byzantium and the Islamic
lands- seen especially in the architecture of its two most prominent buildings, Saint Mark's
Basilica and the Doge's (Duke's) Palace. The basic interior plan of St. Mark's was derived
from the sixth-century Church of the Apostles in Constantinople, and so, unlike most
Italian churches of its time, it is in the form of a Greek cross, with four extensions or “arms"
of equal length. The arrangement of domes above the arms is similar to that of Islamic
architecture in Egypt. However, the architecture of St. Mark's is not a simple imitation of
Eastern antecedents. Although the four arms of the church are of equal length, they vary
in height and width, and the domes were raised and enlarged in the thirteenth century to
make them more prominent in the city's skyline. The adjoining Doge's Palace, which was
the political center of Renaissance Venice, is mostly an example of the Gothic style, which
originated in northern Europe. Yet it, too, has Eastern elements. The details of its roof
ornamentation, the patterns of its pink and white marble facing, and its pointed arches
are reminiscent of major buildings in Egypt, one of Venice's most important trading
partners.
St. Mark's interior has unusually fine examples of Byzantine ornamentation, especially its
gold mosaics. Mosaics are decorations or images made up of small, colored pieces of
glass, stone, or tile, called tesserae. Venetian tesserae were primarily made of glass,
which was easily available from Venice's advanced glass workshops, like those on the
island of Murano. An important effect of glass is that the color changes as the light in a
room changes. This effect, combined with the curving surfaces of domes and vaults
(arched ceilings) and the deliberate setting of tesserae at different angles to catch the
light, produces a striking shimmering quality to St. Mark's. The heavy use of gold had long
been established for religious images in Byzantium, but in Venice, it was extended beyond
the mosaics of St. Mark's to other artistic media. Textiles were often produced with gold
thread. Painters such as Giovanni Bellini (C. 1430-1516) used gold in their paintings, and
artists came from other regions of Europe to learn the techniques for using powdered
gold. The Ca' d'Oro, a famous Venetian palace whose name means “House of Gold,"
even had substantial areas of gold on its exterior.
Eastern influences were not all that made Venetian art special. The city's commercial
connections resulted in its being among the first to adopt new techniques of oil painting
Page 209 of 269
that were developed in Flanders (modern Belgium) in the late fifteenth century. Venice
went on to become famous for its great oil painters, such as Veronese (1528- 1588),
Giorgione (1477/1478- 1510), and Titian (C. 1488/1490- 1576). These painters adopted
some stylistic elements of northern European painting, including the conventions of
portrait painting and the use of mountains and forests in landscapes that typified German
painting. At about the same time that the Flemish were making advances in oil painting
techniques, Johannes Gutenberg (1395- 1468) was perfecting the technology of movable
type in Germany. Venice quickly became one of the most important cities for book
manufacturing in Europe. It had already produced a limited number of prints, but now the
resulting upsurge in publishing created a greater need for illustrations, so there were
increased opportunities for artists to produce woodcuts and engravings for books.

52.1: The Age of Sailing in Europe
Sailing began long before ships were capable of crossing entire oceans. Phoenicians are
known to have sailed from the area of present-day Lebanon and Israel to the Atlantic
Ocean and down the west coast of Africa over two thousand years ago. But the
Phoenicians' boats (as well as those of other early Mediterranean sailors) were primitive
in design and difficult to sail. These early galley ships had one mast and a single square
sail, which meant they could sail well only downwind. Early sailors also lacked any reliable
means of navigation on open seas. Once out of sight of land, sailors had nothing but the
stars to guide them home, and without accurate timepieces and navigational tools,
navigating by the night sky was a daunting and uncertain prospect. At that time, almost
all travel by sea was within a single biogeographic province: from one end of the
Mediterranean Sea to the other, or around the Baltic Sea, or from one South Pacific island
to the next.
“Blue water sailors"- -those willing to sail out of sight of land- -had to wait for several major
developments in sailing technology before they could make open ocean voyages with any
reasonable expectation of being able to return home. European sailors received an
important tool when the compass (a Chinese invention) became available, probably in the
tenth century A.D. Together with maps, the compass allowed sailors to break away from
coastal routes and set out across the open ocean without losing track of where homes
lay. But if they were to make long voyages safely and regularly, sailors also needed boats
they could control in contrary winds. Single-masted boats with square sails hanging
perpendicular to the boat cannot sail upwind efficiently because the sail cannot be
adjusted over a wide range of angles to the wind. Technical improvements that began to
address this problem included arranging the sail fore-and-aft (that is, with the sail parallel
to the length of the ship) and using several sails on several masts or a triangular sail at
the front of the boat. Replacement of the ancient steering oar at the rear of the ship with
a much larger and more easily controllable rudder board also helped provide better
control. Once these crucial innovations had been made around 1300 A.D., ship design
evolved rapidly, and sailors began to set their sights on more distant shores.
But even with compasses and improved ships, sailors still needed a working knowledge
of the wind patterns that would carry them across the oceans- and back home. Between
the 1330s and the 1520s, Portuguese and Spanish sailors discovered and mapped broad
circles of wind that provided reliable routes across the Atlantic and back. A Portuguese
sailor found the Canary Islands off the northwest coast of Africa in 1336 by following the
northeast trade winds southwest from the Iberian Peninsula. Luck and insight eventually
led the Portuguese to discover that the easiest way back was not to sail slowly and
painfully against the wind up the African coast, but to sail west out to sea until they hit the
westerlies, another group of winds that carried them northeast back to Europe. Other
Portuguese and Spanish sailors mapped most of the rest of the great circulatory patterns
of winds by the end of the sixteenth century, making possible the first controlled
movement of large numbers of people and cargo back and forth between Eurasia (the
Page 211 of 269
combined continental landmass of Europe and Asia) and the Americas.
Several elements conspired to make Europe the place where this long series of inventions
and discoveries- -compasses and star charts, ships that could sail into the wind, and
knowledge of wind patterns- came together to create a power that could sail around the
world. Europe's physical position on the globe was as critical a factor in its transoceanic
explorations as were its technologically advanced ships. Compared to the Pacific, the
Atlantic was a manageably-sized ocean to cross on a regular basis, and the Americas
(once discovered) was a much more profitable destination than the scattering of islands
in the Pacific or the emptiness south of the Indian subcontinent. Perhaps even more
important, the social and religious values that characterized many European cultures both
impelled their transoceanic voyages and fueled the innovation that made these voyages
possible.

52.2: Euglena: Ecosystem Engineers
In 1995, an extremophile, or an organism that thrives in extreme environments, was
discovered in the United States in a lake outside of Butte, Montana. The body of water
where it lives, known as the Berkeley Pit, is a former open-pit copper mine that is slowly
filling with groundwater that dissolves heavy metals like arsenic, cadmium, zinc, and
aluminum from the mine's 2,000-foot-deep surface; the dissolved metals mix with the
water to form a toxic (poisonous) solution. The Berkeley Pit is the largest hazardous waste
site targeted for cleanup in the United States. As 2.6 million gallons of groundwater seep
into the pit every day, the toxic brew edges ever closer to spilling into the Clark Fork River,
which makes its way to the Columbia River and out to the ocean, representing a massivescale ecological threat to the fisheries and communities in these areas.
Though the water in the pit is as acidic as lemon juice and considered inhospitable to life,
a novel species has emerged and is slowly but surely changing the lake's toxic brew to
one more habitable. An analytic chemist studying the lake noticed a clump of green slime
floating in the lake and brought a sample to Dr. Grant Mitman of Montana Tech. Mitman
brought his colleagues Don and Andrea Sterile into the lab, and they identified the slime
as a colony of Euglena mutabilis, a single-celled organism that forms algae-like mats.
How Euglena came to grow in the Berkeley Pit is unknown, although some attribute its
spread to a flock of 350 snow geese that landed (and subsequently died) in the lake
several months prior to the discovery of the organism. The geese may have carried
reproductive material of the Euglena in their feces (waste matter).
Euglena is among the oldest organisms in the world, having survived since the time when
conditions on Earth were not too dissimilar to those found in the Berkeley Pit- -ancient
acidic oceans were full of heavy metals and other free-floating elements. These unique
creatures exhibit traits of both plants and animals: they can photosynthesize (produce
their own food using sunlight), but they can also move around in search of food. Their
ability to photosynthesize produces oxygen. As a result of this oxygen combining with the
dissolved iron in the water and by other means, the organisms cause iron to separate
from the watery solution in the form of a solid, thereby creating stable substrates
(surfaces) for other organisms to inhabit. In other words, Euglenas are ecosystem
engineers. They work to improve the environment for themselves and, in doing so, make
their surroundings more habitable for other organisms. This type of bioengineering
(engineering using biological organisms) fostered the development of all life on Earth,
since the production of oxygen led to the proliferation of organisms that depend on
oxygen, and over the course of billions of years, the stable iron-based substrates
eventually contributed to the formation of landmasses out of what was once a planet
covered by water. Species like Euglena manufactured the current configuration of air,
water, and land that makes this planet so uniquely hospitable to life today.
In the Berkeley Pit, Euglenas are doing similar work. They thrive in the heavy-metal-laden
waters of the lake and remove the iron, zinc, and cadmium from the solution, storing them
Page 213 of 269
in their bodies, and rendering the metals biologically inactive. When they die, their bodies
and the metals they contain are deposited in the sediments at the bottom of the lake. The
chemistry of the Berkeley Pit is changing slowly but surely, and research is underway to
encourage the population increase of Euglena and similar organisms to biologically treat
the water before it spills into critical waterways. Since the discovery of Euglena, more
than forty species of similar microorganisms have been discovered in the lake, several of
them new to science. Many of these have found suitable habitats because of the
pioneering work of Euglena, and they also serve to neutralize and repair the pit's toxic
water. Species like Euglena are fascinating from an evolutionary perspective because
they exhibit traits that not only confer advantages to their own species but also create
conditions that enable other types of life to thrive.

53.1: Plant and Animal Domestication
The domestication of plant and animal species in prehistoric times-the so-called Neolithic
Revolution- was a vital innovation and has received a great deal of scrutiny. The
domestication of a species ensured its reproductive success while providing humans with
some type of necessity. Domesticated organisms are usually altered in various ways due
to selective breeding, making them better adapted for interactions with humans.
Wild cereals have a very fragile stem, whereas domesticated ones have a tough stem.
Under natural conditions, plants with fragile stems scatter their seed for themselves,
whereas those with tough stems do not. When the grain stalks were harvested, their soft
stems would shatter at the touch of a harvesting tool, and many of their seeds would be
lost. Inevitably, though unintentionally, most of the seeds that people harvested would
have been taken from the tough plants. Early domesticators probably also tended to
select seeds from plants having few husks (outer seed coverings) or none at all -
eventually breeding them out- because husking prior to pounding the grains into meal or
flour required extra labor. Many of the distinguishing characteristics of domesticated
plants can be seen in remains from archaeological sites. Paleobotanists can often tell the
fossil of a wild plant species from a domesticated one by studying the shape and size of
various plant structures.
Domestication also produced changes in the skeletal structure of some animals. The
horns of wild goats and sheep differ from those of their domesticated counterparts, and
some types of domesticated sheep lack horns altogether. Similarly, the size of an animal
or its parts can vary with domestication, as seen in the smaller size of certain teeth of
domesticated pigs compared to those of wild ones.
A study of age and sex ratios of animal remains at an archaeological site may indicate
whether animal domestication was practiced. Investigators have determined that if the
age and/or sex ratios at the site differ from those in wild herds, the imbalances are due to
domestication. Archaeologists documented a sharp rise in the number of young male
goats killed at 10,000-year-old sites in the Zagros Mountains of Iran. Evidently, people
were killing the young males for food and saving the females for breeding. Although such
herd management does not prove that the goats were fully domesticated, it does indicate
a step in that direction. Similarly, archaeological sites in the Andean highlands dating to
around 6,300 years ago contain evidence that lamas were placed in enclosures,
indicating the beginning of domestication.
Although it is tempting to think that a sudden flash of insight about the human ability to
control plants and animals might have led ancient people to domestication, the evidence
points us in different directions. There are several false ideas about the motivation for
becoming food producers. First, contemporary foragers (people who search for food)
show us that food production probably did not come about from sudden, unforeseen
discoveries, such as that seeds can be planted and grown into plants, since these food
Page 215 of 269
foragers are perfectly aware of the role of seeds in plant growth, that plants grow better
under certain conditions than others, and so forth. Jared Diamond aptly describes
contemporary food foragers as “walking encyclopedias of natural history with individual
names for as many as a thousand or more plant and animal species, and with detailed
knowledge of those species' biological characteristics, distribution, and potential uses."
In addition, food foragers frequently apply their knowledge to actively manage the
resources on which they depend. Indigenous people living in northern Australia
deliberately alter the runoff channels of creeks to flood extensive tracts of land, converting
them into fields of wild grain.
Second, the switch from food foraging to food production does not free people from hard
work. In fact, available ethnographic data indicate just the opposite. They show that
farmers, by and large, work far longer hours compared to most food foragers. Finally, food
production is not necessarily a more secure means of subsistence than food foraging.
Seed crops, in particular -of the sort originally domesticated in Southwest Asia, Central
America, and the Andean highlands- are highly productive but not stable because of low
species diversity. Without constant human attention, their productivity suffers.

53.2: The Atmospheric Greenhouse Effect
The atmospheric greenhouse effect is the result of electromagnetic energy from the Sun
that is trapped in a planet's atmosphere. Atmospheric gases freely transmit visible- -short
wavelength- solar energy, warming the planet's surface. The warmed surface tries to
radiate the excess energy back into space, but because the planet is much colder than
the Sun, it radiates at much longer infrared (IR) wavelengths. But carbon dioxide and
water vapor strongly absorb IR radiation, converting it to thermal (heat) energy. They
subsequently re-radiate this thermal energy in all directions; some of the thermal energy
continues into space, but much of it returns to the ground. The planetary surface receives
thermal energy both from the Sun and from the atmosphere, and consequently, it heats
up.
Nowhere in the solar system is the atmospheric greenhouse effect more dramatic than
on Venus. Its opaque cloud cover and massive atmosphere of carbon dioxide and sulfur
compounds raise Venus's surface temperature by more than 400 K to about 740 K
(870'F). At such high temperatures, any remaining water and most carbon dioxide locked
up in surface rocks would long ago have been driven into the atmosphere, further
enhancing the atmospheric greenhouse effect.
Why does the atmospheric greenhouse effect make the composition of Earth's
atmosphere so different from that of Venus? The answer lies in Earth's location in the
solar system. Consider early Earth and early Venus, each having about the same mass,
but with Venus orbiting somewhat closer to the Sun than Earth does. Volcanoes and
comet impacts poured out large amounts of carbon dioxide and water vapor to form early
atmospheres on both planets. Most of Earth's water quickly rained out of the atmosphere
to fill vast ocean basins, but Venus was closer to the Sun, and its surface temperature
was higher than Earth's, so most of the rainwater on Venus immediately re-evaporated.
Venus was left with a surface containing very little liquid water and an atmosphere filled
with water vapor. The continuing buildup of both water vapor and carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere of Venus then led to a runaway (out of control) atmospheric greenhouse
effect that drove up the surface temperature of the planet. Ultimately, the surface of Venus
became so hot that no liquid water could survive there.
This early difference between a watery Earth and an arid Venus forever changed the ways
that the two planets' atmospheres and surfaces evolved. On Earth, water erosion caused
by rain and rivers continually exposed fresh minerals, which then reacted chemically with
atmospheric carbon dioxide to form solid carbonates (minerals containing metal
combined with oxygen and carbon). This reaction removed some of the atmospheric
carbon dioxide, burying it within Earth's crust as a component of a carbonate rock called
limestone. Later, the development of life in Earth's saltwater oceans accelerated the
removal of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Tiny sea creatures built their protective shells of
carbonates, and as they died, they built up massive beds of limestone on the ocean floors.
As a result of water erosion and the various chemical reactions related to living organisms,
Page 217 of 269
all but a trace of Earth's total inventory of carbon dioxide is now tied up in limestone beds.
Earth's particular location in the solar system seems to have spared it from the runaway
atmospheric greenhouse effect. But what if Earth had formed a bit closer to the Sun? If
all the carbon dioxide now in limestone beds had not been locked up by these reactions,
Earth's atmospheric composition would resemble that of Venus or Mars.
Some scientists think that Venus once had as much water as Earth-as liquid oceans or
as more water vapor than is measured today. If that's true, what happened to all the
water? One possibility is that water molecules high in Venus' atmosphere were broken
apart into hydrogen and oxygen by solar ultraviolet radiation. Hydrogen atoms, being of
very low mass, were quickly lost to space. Oxygen escaped more slowly, so some
eventually migrated downward to the planet's surface, where it could have been removed
from the atmosphere by combining with surface minerals. The Venus Express spacecraft
has measured hydrogen, and some oxygen, escaping from the upper levels of Venus's
atmosphere.

54.1: Megafauna Extinctions in Ancient Australia
In an effort to discover the connections in Australia's past between climate change, the
vanishing of the large Ice Age animals (megafauna) there, and the arrival of humans,
Gifford Miller turned to fossil eggshells he found in dune deposits along the ancient
shoreline of a now vanished lake. The eggshells had been left by emus, ostrich-like
flightless birds that still walk Australia's savannas and woodlands, and by Genyornis
newtoni, an extinct bird species whose massive bones suggest each individual would
have weighed about 550 pounds. Australia's acid soils and severe climate quickly leach
all organic matter out of bone. But because eggshells have a different mineral structure
than bone, the ancient shells retained traces of protein. This made it possible to date them
using a technique called amino acid racemization. Results from a large set of samples- -
1,200 dates collected from three different sites- -showed that the emu and Genyornis had
coexisted for millennia. Then, about 45,000-50,000 years ago, Genyornis vanished.
The eggshells also offered clues to the big birds' diets. Grasses that thrive in hot habitats
use a unique chemical pathway to capture the Sun's energy, a process that distorts the
amount of the stable isotope carbon-13 they contain relative to most other plants. Miller
and his colleagues compared the carbon isotope signatures of fossil emu and Genyornis
eggshells. The results show that the two bird species relied on different food sources.
Grass must have been abundant right before the extinction event, because the emu of
that era ate little else. The doomed Genyornis ate both shrubs and grass.
Two large, flightless birds living in the same habitat would have to develop different
survival strategies and different food sources or constantly clash with each other. The
emu is now, as it was during the Pleistocene (1.8 million years ago-11,700 years ago), a
flexible eater. If necessary, it ate only grass, but it could also make do with shrubs and
herbs. Genyornis included shrubs in its menu but seems to have been unable to get by
without grass. About 45,000 years ago, the vegetation changed throughout the Lake Eyre
basin. Emus shifted their tactics and began eating lots of shrubs. Genyornis could not
adapt, and the species died out. More recently, Miller has analyzed the carbon isotope
signatures of teeth fossils of the wombat (a pouched mammal). Like the emu, the wombat
survived the ecological shift that came 45,000 years ago because it fed on shrubs, making
do without grass.
According to Miller, the arrival of people carrying fire sticks in their hands changed
everything. The harsh landscape of interior Australia does not hold well-preserved
deposits of ancient pollen that might precisely track the changing vegetation. Based on
the shifting diets of the herbivores he has studied, however, Miller can envision how and
why the balance tipped. “Before people came, there must have been a savanna mixed
with open woodland, the kind of habitat where grasses are abundant in years of good
rainfall, and the trees and shrubs sustain the animals when water is scarce," he explains.
Frequent burning tends to favor grasses over shrubs and trees, yet at the moment of
human arrival, emus and wombats stopped eating grass, and Genyornis simply vanished.
Page 219 of 269
Miller argues that burning did promote one kind of grass growth, but that grass was
spinifex, an unpleasant-tasting species that now dominate the region. Spinifex leaves are
heavily loaded with silica and are nutrient-poor. No native mammal eats it, and introduced
cattle will take only the freshest, youngest shoots that sprout up after a fire. And spinifex
loves fire: it grows in hummocks (low mounds) where alive and dead blades intermix,
laden with flammable resin, and it resprouts quickly after a burn. Australian plants had
evolved with fire for millions of years. Before people came, the bush burned regularly at
the end of the dry season, the time of many lightning strikes. But humans could light fires
at any time of the year. In Miller's scenario, the increased frequency of fire wiped out many
plants. Many ecosystems in the interior, he says, are adapted to burn every 20 to 50
years, the kind of frequency that occurs if lightning is the only ignition source. Torched
frequently by Aboriginal people, such habitats would not have enough time to recover
between burns.

54.2: The Port of Melaka
The port of Melaka, on the southwestern coast of the Malay Peninsula, was founded
around the turn of the fourteenth century, and it continued the tradition of a previous
regional power, Srivijaya, in ensuring the success of international trade. It owed its
success to a number of factors. In the first place, it was generally able to guarantee the
safety of its sea lanes. The rulers of Melaka, like those of Srivijaya, commanded the
allegiance of various Orang Laut groups (nomadic sea peoples) who protected Melaka's
clients and attacked ships going to rival ports. These safeguards (and the threat of attack
for those who passed by Melaka) were an important element in the decision of traders to
frequent the new settlement in preference to other ports in the region.
Secondly, Melaka was attractive to traders because of its commercial facilities. High
priority was given to security within the town and to the protection of foreign merchants
and their goods. For example, underground warehouses were constructed where stored
goods would be less vulnerable to fire, damage, or theft. Such measures were necessary
because departures, arrivals, and the exchange of goods were all governed by the
monsoon winds (the seasonal wind of the Indian Ocean and southern Asia). Between
December and March, the period of greatest activity, vessels reached Melaka from
western Asia and the Far East; it was not until May, however, that ships from Java to the
south and the eastern Indonesian archipelago (chain of islands) began to arrive. All
traders, especially those from China and eastern Indonesia, had some time to wait before
the change in monsoon winds made their homeward voyage possible. Secure storage
facilities were, therefore, a significant factor in Melaka's ability to attract international
clients.
Third and most important was Melaka's efficient legal and administrative machinery,
which provided the predictability essential for the long-term plans of foreign traders. The
Undang-Undang Melaka, the first code of laws in the Malay world, devotes considerable
attention to the regulation of commercial matters. A separate codification of maritime laws
concentrated specifically on matters concerned with sea-going trade, such as the
collection of debts, shipboard crimes, and the duties of a captain and crew.
Melaka's administrative system also directly responded to the needs of a growing trading
community. Four syahbandars, or harbor masters, were appointed, each one
representing different ethnic groupings. Each syahbandar was required to oversee the
affairs of his particular group; manage the marketplace and the warehouse; maintain a
check on weights, measures, and coinage; and adjudicate in any disputes between ship
captains and merchants. The ruler of Melaka was the final arbiter who settled all quarrels
between the different trading communities. Whenever a ship arrived in port, the captain
reported to his particular syahbandar, who in turn referred him to Melaka's principal
minister, the bendahara. The syahbandar then supplied elephants for the captain to
transport his cargo to a warehouse assigned for the temporary storage of his goods.
Before trading could be conducted, customs duties were paid in accordance with the
Page 221 of 269
value of the merchandise and the area from which the trader came. In addition, it was
necessary to present gifts to the ruler, the bendahara, and the temenggung (the Melaka
official principally involved in the collection of import and export duties), as well as to the
appropriate syahbandar.
Melaka's reputation for security, a well-ordered government, and a cosmopolitan and wellequipped marketplace all attest to the priority its rulers placed on creating the conditions
for safe and profitable commerce. But these facilities alone would not have automatically
attracted traders. The fundamental element in Melaka's success as a storage and
distribution center was the dual role it played as the principal collecting point for spices
such as cloves, nutmeg, and mace from islands to the east and as an important
redistribution center for Indian textiles. Indian cloth was carried mainly by Malay traders
from Melaka to various parts of the archipelago and exchanged for spices, aromatic
woods, sea products, and other exotic items highly prized by traders from both East and
West. Without the spices from the eastern islands and the Indian cloth, Melaka would
have been simply one of a number of other ports in the area specializing in a few local
products.

55.1: Cave Artists
The earliest surviving cave and rock art was created in the Paleolithic period (40,000-
10,000 years ago) in locations that were not sites of human habitation. Some Paleolithic
artwork was ephemeral—only six examples of open-air engravings survive—but the fineart engravings and paintings that decorate caves were made to last and did last, in some
cases for hundreds and even thousands of years, during which they were available for
delight and use. Big cave galleries thus contained work done over a long period, available
for comparison to people who had some notion of historical time and were developing a
sense of their ancestry. The best Paleolithic art, especially the polychrome paintings, was
the work of professionals.
We can say this with some confidence, for cave art at its best was difficult and expensive
to produce. In the first place, it required lighting. Some 85 certain and 31 probable
examples of Paleolithic lamps have survived, but less than one-third of them were found
inside caves. The conjecture, therefore, is that artists usually worked by torchlight. Both
lamps and torches consume animal fats in large quantities. Second, while it is true that
some of the best cave paintings, especially at Altamira in Spain, were painted by artists
standing up, or in some cases, lying down or squatting, others required elaborate
scaffolding, no different in principle from that used by Renaissance artist Michelangelo
when he painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. Some of the paintings were done on a
gigantic scale or at heights many feet above the cave floor. The sheer scale of the art is
daunting. The big cave vault at Lascaux, known as the Picture Gallery, is over 100 feet
long and 35 feet wide. Caves were specially chosen for their size as well as for their
security. Niaux in the Pyrenees Mountains in Europe is over half a mile in length, and this
is by no means unusual. The big cave art Rouffignac runs over 6 miles (more than 9
kilometers) into the mountain, and some of its huge collection of drawing engravings are
nearly 7 feet (over 2 meters) long.
Professional cave artists, then, needed not only platforms and scaffolding, whose
existence at Lascaux, for instance, is betrayed by sockets cut into the walls, but
assistants. They mixed the paints, some of which had to be used quickly before they
dried; filled the lamps or held the torches; put up and secured the scaffolding; and made
the brushes from twigs, feathers, leaves, and animal hairs, to the satisfaction of the
master. These assistants probably graduated as masters themselves. It is not going too
far to speak of a studio system as the basis of Paleolithic cave art. After all, there is
positive evidence that art studios, where important works were fabricated and artists
trained, existed in Egypt at least as far back as 3000 B.C. That still leaves a gap of 7,000
years from the end of the Paleolithic period, but the quality and consistency of the bestpainted work in caves, and the evidence of the time, expense, and skill required to
produce them, do suggest that artists needed the collective support of something very
like a studio. The probability is that the leading cave artists were important persons.
This brings us to quality. To modern eyes, accustomed to 5,000 years of continuous
Page 223 of 269
development in the depiction of living forms, the best of the Paleolithic paintings are
magnificent. Indeed, seen in depth and in the total silence of the caves, the images are
awesome. Human forms are rare and often quite unsophisticated, but the variety of
animal forms is impressive. In the eight galleries of the great cave at Les Eyzies, there
are multiple examples of mammoths, reindeer, horses, stags, bison, and wolves, as well
as humanoids and abstractions or signs. These interlocking galleries, unfolding one by
one, are meant to impress, and they do. The art is both detailed and monumental,
oscillating designedly between simplification and elaboration, between stasis and
extreme dynamism. Some Paleolithic artists clearly understood both the anatomy of the
animals they depicted and their principles of motion, the result of intense observation over
many years and of self-discipline in rendering that suggests a long apprenticeship and
extensive study.

55.2: Breathing Inside an Egg
Tucked away inside its shell, a bird embryo has to breathe. But, rather than using lungs
to draw air in and push carbon dioxide and water vapor out, a bird embryo relies on
“diffusion"- -the natural movement of gases- -much as do insects (which also lack lungs).
In fact, both insects and eggs use tiny pores, or holes, and pore canals that connect the
outside with their interior. For birds, there are hundreds or thousands of tiny pores
distributed all over the shell surface. The pores connect, via a narrow tube, the embryo's
blood supply to the outside world. The number of pores per egg varies markedly between
species, partly but not entirely related to the size of the egg. Since the pores are fairly
straight and run vertically from the inner to the outer surface, their length is usually similar
to the thickness of the shell. Generally, the number and size of pores determine how much
and how fast oxygen diffuses into the egg. As well as taking away unwanted carbon
dioxide, the pores allow water vapor to escape from the developing embryo. As the
embryo grows, it generates water, referred to as metabolic water, produced as a result of
the metabolism of food. Different foods generate different amounts of metabolic water.
Fat, for example, yields comparatively high amounts of metabolic water.
Inside an egg, the developing chick generates plenty of metabolic water from the fat-rich
yolk (yellow part of the egg) as it grows. This water has to be removed; otherwise, the
embryo would drown in its own juices, so to speak, and it does this by allowing it to diffuse
as water vapor through the pores in the shell. As a result, eggs lose weight during the
course of incubation. What is remarkable is that, despite the huge variation across bird
species in the size of eggs, the duration of incubation, and the relative size of the yolk,
the loss of water between laying and hatching is always about 15 percent of the egg's
initial weight. The water vapor lost during incubation ensures that the relative amount of
water in the egg is the same in the chick at hatching as it was when the egg was laid. In
other words, the composition of the newly laid egg has evolved through natural selection
to ensure that the newly hatched chick has the right composition- -in terms of the amount
of water in its tissues, too. This is achieved by adjusting-via natural selection- -the
effective pore area such that all the metabolic water produced during development is
eliminated before hatching. One consequence of this loss of water vapor is a space in the
egg, roughly 15 percent of its volume, that becomes the air cell at the blunt, or the flat
end of the egg, and provides the amount of air needed by the chick just before it hatches.
The air cell is formed between the inner and outer shell membranes when the egg is laid.
As the egg cools and its contents contract after leaving the female's body, the air is drawn
in through the pores and accumulates in a lens-shaped pocket at the blunt end of the egg.
If you hold a hen's egg against a bright light, you can see the air cell. Furthermore, when
you peel a hard-boiled egg to eat, the air cell's presence is revealed by the flattened area
of white at the blunt end where the air cell has pressed down on the albumen (egg white).
William Harvey, in the 1600s, was the first to think about the role of the air cell, dismissing
the then-widespread belief that its position in the egg signaled the sex of the chick. As
development proceeds, the air space increases in size, and it is for this reason that you
Page 225 of 269
can assess the age of an egg, or its stage of development, from how it floats in water: a
very fresh egg with virtually no air cell sinks; an older egg floats.
Because gases behave differently under pressure, we might expect the size and number
of pores to differ among birds breeding at different altitudes. Specifically, the loss of gases
will be less at high altitudes. And this is confirmed by a comparison of birds breeding at
different elevations: species breeding at high altitudes have fewer, smaller eggshell pores.

56.1: Polynesian Migration
Polynesia is a large grouping of islands scattered over the central and southern Pacific
Ocean. The origins of the indigenous people of the Polynesian islands are the subject of
some debate, as are the reasons for their migration from one island to another. In about
3000 B.C.E., people living in the Bismarck Archipelago (a chain of islands in the
neighboring region of Melanesia) began making pottery, keeping domesticated dogs,
pigs, and chickens, and growing vegetables. Their culture was known as the Lapita
culture, and the people were likely ethnic Chinese. In about 1300 B.C.E., they began to
spread eastward into Polynesia. Over the next 2,300 years, they brought their culture to
several islands there, including New Zealand, where the Polynesian settlers became
known as the Maori people. Their long voyages were made in canoes approximately 65
feet (20 meters) long. These canoes carried crews of at least five and up to 15, with a
supply of vegetables, live chickens and pigs, and water stored in gourds that could be
augmented by collecting rainwater in sailcloth.
Navigators memorized the routes to other islands and taught them to young men who
were learning the skill of navigating, in the form of songs and drawings. Their method was
based first on their knowledge of the direction and times of rising and setting of the most
prominent stars and planets. Voyages began at dusk. The navigator set a course in
relation to the direction of prominent landmarks that were still visible and of the stars, and
during the night, he would steer by the stars. During the day, he would steer by the Sun.
The condition of the sea and the direction of the wind also provided valuable information.
In the tropical Pacific, the prevailing winds blow from the northeast to the north of the
equator and from the southeast to the south of the equator. Because they blow for most
of the time, the winds produce a large swell, with waves that all move in the same
direction. Navigators could steer by the direction of their canoe in relation to the swell,
and they would tow a length of rope in the water behind the canoe. If a sudden wave or
gust of wind blew the canoe to one side, the rope would not be affected, and its line would
record the direction they should steer. Small pennants (flags) tied to the canoe indicated
the wind direction, which was also useful. In addition, Polynesian sailors knew the paths
followed by migrating birds and whales. They were familiar with ocean currents, the cloud
patterns that formed over distant islands, and they watched for floating plant debris that
indicated land just over the horizon.
Polynesian navigation was remarkably skillful-but why were the Polynesians so restless?
One possible clue can be found in the fact that despite living on islands surrounded by
abundant stocks of fish, the people of the Cook Islands seldom eat fish. The seas around
Rapa Nui support many species of edible fish, as well as lobsters and turtles. These have
always been an important part of the Rapa Nui islanders' diet, and island traditions
forbade fishing at certain times of the year, which prevented the overexploitation of stocks.
As recently as the early twentieth century, however, the islanders believed that the fish
living in deep water farther from shore were poisonous, and they refused to touch them.
Page 227 of 269
In 2009, Teina Rongo, a Cook Island marine biologist, aroused considerable interest
among historians when he proposed that from time to time, the fish on which Polynesians
depended had turned poisonous, and the islanders had suffered from a type of food
poisoning called ciguatera. Robbed of their food supply, they had no alternative but to
move elsewhere. Ciguatera is caused by eating fish contaminated by a single-celled
organism called Gambierdiscus toxicus. The poisoning is seldom fatal, although it can be;
its symptoms include vomiting, blurred vision, a burning sensation in contact with a cold
surface, and heartbeat irregularities. Common throughout the Tropics, this poisoning is
most severe in people who have eaten carnivorous reef fish such as barracuda, snapper,
and grouper. It may be that the waves of Polynesian migration were motivated by the
need to find wholesome food.

56.2: The Ecological Roles of Birds
Birds provide numerous invaluable ecological services, and one of the most important is
by scattering plant seeds. Seed dispersal enables plants to migrate into new territory and
reduces competition with others of their own species, thereby increasing survival rates.
In fact, if you enjoy spicy foods, you owe some appreciation to birds, who played a pivotal
role in the evolution of chili peppers. In an example of evolutionary partnership, chili plants
evolved in a way that offers birds a nutritious food source, while the plants benefited from
the wide distribution of their seeds after passing through the birds' digestive systems.
Capsaicin is the molecule in spicy peppers that creates the sensation of heat we feel
when it binds to pain receptors in the mouth. On a human tongue, a solution of just ten
parts per million creates a distinct sense of burning, but nerve receptors in birds do not
register the heat of capsaicin even if they ingest as much as twenty thousand parts per
million.
Bird digestive systems also do the seeds of the chili pepper no harm, because many birds
with a fondness for them have a rather short, straight digestive pipe through which food
transits quickly. Researchers have even found snails that had been eaten by a bird,
passed through its digestive tract, cast out the other end, and were still alive. Moreover,
chili peppers can be plucked readily from the stem only when they are ripe, which means
only those seeds ready to germinate (begin growing from a seed into a plant) are
swallowed by the bird. Catching the eye of birds helps pepper plants expand their range.
If mammals ate chilies, they would digest and destroy them or deposit them fairly close
to the plant. Birds, however, drop the undigested seeds in faraway places. The cradle of
chili pepper civilization is in Brazil, in a lowland region dubbed “the nuclear area" because
it has the largest number of wild varieties of chilies in the world. It is believed that the first
wild chili peppers sprang to life here and were spread across much of the Western
Hemisphere by birds.
Birds shape the plant world in myriad other fascinating ways. Some two thousand species
inadvertently play the middleman in sexual relations between plants. White-winged doves
that survive in the desert on cactus flower nectar carry pollen between saguaro cactus
flowers, and hummingbirds seek out the nectar of a variety of wildflowers and domestic
crops; some hummingbirds visit thousands of flowers in a day, and as they search for
nectar, they carry millions of tiny grains of pollen stuck to their heads, beaks, and feathers,
brushing flowers like flying paintbrushes.
There are places where birds and the pivotal roles they play have vanished. The extinction
of the dodo, the three-foot-tall flightless bird of Mauritius, could well be the cause of the
decline of the tambalacoque tree, also known as the dodo tree, which is highly valued for
its timber (wood). Some plants have just a single animal partner that plays a key role in
their life, and in the case of the peach-tree-like tambalacoque, the dodo's digestive tract
may have been vital in paving the way for the tree's successful growth. As the seeds
moved through the bird's system, fruit pulp was scrubbed off, reducing the risk that
Page 229 of 269
bacteria and fungi would kill the seeds before they germinated. These days, botanists
growing tambalacoque trees pass their seeds through wild turkeys or even gem-polishing
machines to roughen and clean them in preparation for planting.
Large enough flocks of birds can also be a factor in the weather. When millions of
migratory seabirds arrive in the Arctic each summer, they bring a huge burst of guano
(bird waste). As bacteria go to work on the guano and break it down, they emit ammonia.
As sulfuric acid and water combine with the ammonia in the atmosphere, bigger particles
are formed, which become the nuclei for cloud droplets and thus create cooling clouds.
The number of cloud droplets near seabird colonies can be 50 percent more than in those
areas without birds. Smaller droplets are also formed, which reflect sunlight and
contribute to the cooling effect. When seabirds change their migratory patterns or
disappear, experts believe they may contribute to changes in Arctic weather.

57.1: The Harappan Decline
The Harappan civilization flourished around the Indus River Valley on the western Indian
subcontinent from about 2700 to 2000 B.C.E. The Harappans exploited the seasonal
overflow from their rivers by capturing the water with dams and distributing it to cropgrowing farms. They built cities of brick and traded widely, sending wood, fabrics, and
other products to Mesopotamia, where other early civilizations thrived.
By around 1900 B.C. E., the Harappan civilization was in decline, a result likely related to
environmental degradation. Intensive plant growth, water-saturated land, and hot, dry
summer climates cause rapid surface evaporation over time, drawing salts in the Earth
closer to the surface, where they slowly poison plant life through a process called
salinization. Moreover, salt-permeated topsoil is easily blown away by passing winds,
causing desertification (fertile land turning into desert). These conditions are further
exacerbated where a hard layer of bedrock impervious to water lies not far beneath the
surface, as is the case in the valley of the Indus. Such soil formations mean water tends,
even more, to stay close to the surface (a high water table), where the process of
evaporation is greatest. Salinization is particularly deadly in regions experiencing a period
of decreasing local rainfall, as the drier the air, the faster the evaporation, and hence, the
quicker the rise in salts to the surface. A shift eastward of seasonal rains may have been
responsible for decreasing moisture on the western Indian subcontinent, encouraging a
drying trend that became well established there and in Mesopotamia, where civilizations
also began to decline around the same period.
Ironically, both the Harappan and Mesopotamian civilizations' management of their
natural resources may have figured in this mutual decline. Much of the HarappanMesopotamian bulk trade was in Harappan wood. Harappan woodsmen may have
stripped much of the Indus Valley of its local forests for this trade and to provide fuel for
the ovens that dried the bricks used widely in Harappan construction. Mesopotamians
had already deforested their lands, hence their need for outside suppliers of wood. The
removal of forest cover, for any reason, increases flooding, because trees hold water in
the soil. The making of burnt bricks and the trade in wood, combined with drought, was a
prescription for disaster.
Dramatic earth movements have often altered the course of human history: earthquakerelated tsunamis (large ocean waves) alone have eradicated cities from ancient Mycenae
(Crete) to Port Royal (Jamaica) in the early modern period. The fate of Harappans was
probably sealed by a series of earthquakes and other geologic events between 1900 and
1500 B.C.E. that uplifted land and shifted river beds so as to create an even greater
pooling of water in a time of flood, further increasing salinization. Increasingly
unproductive land and declining Mesopotamian trade would have made it harder to fix the
damage done by floods and earthquakes. Cities show signs of a slow dissolution of civic
cohesion, including the rise of slums (low-quality residential areas) and a decline in the
quality of crafts.
Page 231 of 269
Harappan cities along the Indus and Ghaggar-Hakra rivers may have been the first to
perish, as their life-giving waters shifted or largely dried up by 1900 B.C.E. Other cities,
such as the port at Lothal, may have survived for perhaps two centuries longer until river
courses either shifted away from or flooded over them. In an effort to avoid annihilation,
Harappans may have moved farther east and south in search of fertile land and reliable
rainfall. Such a migration might explain the ancient Harappan-like dam structures and
cultural fragments found along rivers in the Deccan Plateau in India.
Language offers further evidence of Harappan migration. In an isolated valley of what
used to be the Harappans' region, the earliest form of language found (called Brahui) is
related to the earliest form of the Dravidian language group, which is widely spoken in the
southern regions of the Indian subcontinent but has few clear connections to other
language groups. If the Brahui-speaking inhabitants of Harappan lands are the
descendants of speakers of the ancient Harappan language, so also are speakers of
Dravidian. The idea of such an ancient lineage is very popular among Dravidian speakers.
It is challenged by many other linguists, however, who argue that Brahui speakers
migrated to their present location from their original home in the Dravidian-speaking
south.

57.2: Where Life Arose
Life could not have come into being on Earth until after about 4 billion years ago when
bombardment by asteroids had subsided substantially. Even after Earth's surface had
stabilized, certain conditions were required for the origin of life. Some researchers have
concluded that precursor compounds, and ultimately life itself, arose in small bodies of
water that were struck by lightning and turned into what is sometimes referred to as the
"primordial soup "of organic compounds. The problem with that idea is that it would have
required an atmosphere lacking oxygen because even a small amount of oxygen would
have oxidized, and, thereby, destroyed chemical raw materials necessary for the
production of essential organic compounds.
Knowing that photosynthesis produces the preponderance of oxygen in Earth's
atmosphere today, scientists once assumed that the atmosphere lacked free oxygen
before the origin of photosynthetic organisms. We now know, however, that ultraviolet
light breaks down water vapor in Earth's upper atmosphere, slowly liberating oxygen,
which spreads in small quantities throughout the atmosphere. This process would have
contributed a small amount of oxygen to the ancient atmosphere-enough to destroy
chemical compounds essential to life. Life must have originated not in a small body of
water that was exposed to atmospheric oxygen but in some environment that was isolated
from Earth's atmosphere. The most likely setting was a warm area beneath the seafloor
in the vicinity of a mid-ocean ridge (submarine mountain range).
The heat that rises from Earth's mantle (the layer between the crust and the planet's
central core) along mid-ocean ridges warms seawater that has percolated into the crust
through pores and cracks. Because heating causes water to expand and so reduces its
density, this water rises back to the ocean. In some areas, it flows from the seafloor
through large vents as columns of very hot water. Bacteria of many kinds inhabit the warm
water of ridge environments, occupying pores, cracks, and vents. They live in a variety of
ways, but most of them derive energy from the chemicals that the hot water has dissolved
while moving through the ridge system. Some of these bacteria live in water warmer than
100 degrees Celsius, which remains in a liquid state because of the great pressure
applied by the ocean above. Others live in lukewarm water farther from ridge axes. In
general, these high-temperature bacteria may be inhabiting the kind of setting where life
originated.
The principle that most warm-adapted bacteria put into practice to obtain energy is quite
simple: they harness the energy of naturally occurring chemical reactions. Many of the
chemical compounds that emerge from deep within mid-ocean ridges are not stable after
the rising water in which they are dissolved cools and mixes with seawater, so they will
enter into chemical reactions. Many such reactions do not occur quickly, however, and
the bacteria take advantage of this situation. The bacteria consume the chemical
compounds and simply allow chemical reactions that would have occurred in seawater to
take place inside their cells. These reactions release energy. The bacteria harness the
Page 233 of 269
energy for their metabolism and excrete the chemical products of the reactions.
Some warm-adapted bacteria actively carry out chemical synthesis, but unlike
photosynthetic organisms, they do not use light as an energy source. Other kinds of
bacteria get energy by combining hydrogen or sulfur with oxygen in the way that higher
organisms obtain energy by oxidizing sugars.
There is evidence that the warm-adapted bacteria that live in the vicinity of mid-ocean
ridges are actually the most primitive living bacteria. Biologists have compared the genetic
material, DNA and RNA, of all kinds of bacteria to reconstruct their evolutionary
relationships. Those features of DNA and RNA that are shared by many bacterial groups
are regarded as primitive features inherited from very ancient ancestors. Traits shared by
a few bacterial groups are regarded as indicating more recent branchings of the
evolutionary tree. Using this method, it turns out that the most primitive living bacteria
(Archaebacteria) are adapted to warm habitats. This finding suggests that bacteria
evolved in such habitats, perhaps in the vicinity of mid-ocean ridges.

58.1: Porcelain in Seventeenth-and Eighteenth-Century England
Porcelain is a white ceramic that originated in China and that incorporates kaolin clay.
When Asian porcelains first appeared in Europe, Europeans were delighted and mystified
by their lightness, hardness, and translucence (allowing light to pass through). Starting in
the seventeenth century, Britain's East India Company imported large quantities of goods
from East Asia, with the volume of imported porcelain rising dramatically toward the end
of that century and into the eighteenth. One reason for this increased importation of
porcelain was the increasing popularity of hot beverages: coffee, chocolate, and tea. The
earliest London coffeehouses date from the 1650s, and though the first known
advertisement for tea appeared in 1656, it was not imported by the East India Company
for resale in Britain until 1678. The rising popularity of coffee drinking and tea drinking in
Britain, and the vastly increased importation of Far East ceramics, are thus both
phenomena that had their origins in high-class British social life during the last quarter of
the seventeenth century. Being heavy and not susceptible to water damage, porcelain
was packed underneath the very much lighter cargoes of tea brought by the East India
Company. The histories of the two are thus closely intertwined, and the links extended
from the act of importation to its sale-as porcelain dealers very often sold tea, coffee, and
chocolate in addition to ceramics and glass -right through the final act of consumption.
Porcelain was resistant to the thermal shock of contact with boiling water, but unlike silver
(of which late-seventeenth-and early-eighteenth-century teapots continued to be made),
it did not get uncomfortably hot. And being of Asian origin, it no doubt seemed the
appropriate material from which to drink the teas imported by the East India Company. As
importation increased, some of the mystery surrounding its production was dispelled.
Indeed, its preparation was described in two letters by Pere D'Entrecolles, a Jesuit
missionary resident at the great ceramic center of Jingdezhen, China, in 1712 and 1722.
These letters were published in Paris in the 1720s and subsequently appeared in a work
on China published in French and English editions in the 1730s.
Although Asian wares had much to recommend to seventeenth-and eighteenth-century
Europeans, three characteristics, in particular, excited their admiration. Firstly, there were
the physical qualities of the material itself, which was hard and white-bodied, and -most
remarkable to Western eyes-could be translucent if thinly made. Secondly, the wares
were technically superior to almost all seventeenth-and eighteenth-century European
ceramics, not allowing liquids to pass through and resistant to wear and tear. Finally, they
came embellished with painted patterns in blue, or with brightly enameled decoration, the
subjects and scenes of which must have appeared fascinating to Western eyes.
The late-seventeenth-century taste for such exotic porcelain wares was part of a wider
fashion that embraced Asian goods in other materials, including Chinese and Japanese
lacquerware (household goods coated with a protective material made from tree resins),
silks and fans, and printed cottons and embroideries from the Indian subcontinent. From
the fact that such goods were brought to the West by European East India companies,
Page 235 of 269
imported decorative work of this type was frequently called "Indian" during the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries since the geography and cultural diversity of Asia
were very little understood by the European consumers in these years. Like the Indian
cotton cloth known as calico, the majority of Chinese porcelains that found their way to
the West during the eighteenth century were specially made for the Western market, very
often after prototypes or design specifications were supplied or laid down by European
merchants. In the case of textiles, and to a lesser degree in ceramics, the designs with
which they were embellished were also frequently based on Western reworkings of, or
fantasies upon, Asian themes and decorative styles. The porcelain wares made to
Western order and specifications were themselves copied and adapted in the ceramic
factories of Europe, and some of these, in due course, made their way back to China,
where they became the subject of further copying and variation.

58.2: Transitions in World Populations
Unless we know the size, density, age distribution, and reproductive capacity of a
population, it is difficult to understand many aspects of its society, politics, and economy.
In the contemporary world, most nations conduct periodic censuses to assess the present
situation of their populations and to plan for the future. Before the mid-eighteenth century,
when census-taking became a regular procedure, population estimates and counts were
sporadic and usually inaccurate. Thus, arriving at estimates of populations from the past,
especially for non-literate societies, is a highly speculative exercise in which
archaeological evidence and estimates of the productive capacity of agricultural practices
and technology are used. The earliest date for a population estimate with a margin of
error of less than 20 percent is probably 1750.
The history of human population can be divided into two basic periods: a long era-almost
all of human history-of very slow growth, and a very short period-about 250 years from
the mid-1700s to the present-of very rapid growth. Before agriculture was developed, the
hunting-and-gathering economies of the world's populations supported 5 to 10 million
people, if modern studies of such populations can be used as a guide. After about 8000
B.C.E., when plants and animals were domesticated, the world's population began to
increase more rapidly but still at a modest level. Although agriculture provided a more
secure and larger food supply, population concentration in villages and towns would have
made people more susceptible to disease and thus reduced their numbers. Some
historians also believe that the settled agricultural life also led to intensified warfare
(because of the struggle for land and water) and increasing social stratification within
societies.
Still, the Neolithic revolution, the shift from hunting-and-gathering to settled agricultural
life, stimulated population growth. It was the first major transition in the history of world
population. One estimate, based on Roman and Chinese population counts and some
informed guesses about the rest of the world, is an annual growth rate of about 0.36 per
million. By 1 C.E., the world population may have been about 300 million people. It
increased between 1 C.E. and 1750 C. E. to about 500 million people. We should bear in
mind that during this period of general increase, there were always areas that suffered a
decline, sometimes drastic, because of wars, epidemics, or natural catastrophes, such as
the disastrous decline of American Indian populations after contact with Europeans,
caused by disease, conquest, and social disruption.
A second and extremely important transition took place between the mid-seventeenth and
the mid-eighteenth centuries. Initially based on new food resources, this transition often
is associated with the Industrial Revolution, when new sources of energy were harnessed.
The growth rate greatly increased during this period in the countries most affected.
Between 1750 and 1800, the world population grew at a rate of more than 4 percent a
year to more than a billion people. By the mid-twentieth century, the world growth rate
had tripled, and by 1990 the world population had risen to more than 5 billion.
Page 237 of 269
This demographic transition took place first in Europe and is still more characteristic of
the developed world. Most pre-modern agrarian economies were characterized by a
balance between the annual number of births and deaths; both were high. Life expectancy
usually was less than 35 years, and the high mortality was compensated by high fertility;
that is, women had many children. Improvements in medicine, hygiene, diet, and the
general standard of living contributed to a decrease in mortality in the eighteenth century.
This allowed populations to begin to grow at a faster rate. By the nineteenth century, in
most of Western Europe, the decline in mortality was followed by a decline in fertility. In
some countries, such as France, these two transitions took place at about the same time,
so population growth was limited. In much of Europe, however, the decline in fertility
lagged behind the decrease in mortality, so there was a period of rapid population growth.
Until the 1920s, population growth in Western Europe and the United States was higher
than in the rest of the world, especially in the less industrialized countries. In recent times,
that situation has been reversed.

59.1: The Jack Pine and Fire
The jack pine tree of Canada has several qualities that seem to equip it for life with fire.
As in many conifer trees, the branches nearer the ground tend to die off as the tree grows
taller, not least because they find themselves without light. In the jack pine, however,
these dead branches simply fall off. If the dead branches were allowed to persist, they
would provide a "ladder" for the fire from the ground to the top. The physics of fire is, in
many ways, counterintuitive. Crucially, a hot fire that burns itself out quickly can be less
damaging than one that's somewhat cooler but lasts longer. Jack pine needles are high
in resin (a flammable organic substance secreted by trees) and often low in water,
especially in the droughts of spring and summer when fires are likely, and so, they burn
hot but quickly. On much the same principle, the jack pine's bark is flaky. It picks up
surface fires but then burns swiftly and does little harm. The stringy bark of eucalyptus
trees in Australia, hanging loosely from the smooth trunk beneath, is protective in much
the same way. In both cases, the discarded bark prevents the fire from seriously harming
the tree.
On the other hand, when jack pine bark accumulates on the ground (as it does if there is
a long interval between fires), surface fires—particularly in spring and summer--can be
very fierce. Then most trees of all kinds are killed. But the jack pine is typically the first to
spring back, for a very hot fire in the summer burns both the leaf litter on the surface and
the organic material in the soil itself, leaving a bare, mineral soil behind. Jack pines
germinate well in such soil and, indeed, are inhibited by leaf litter. They like bright sunlight,
too, and appreciate the open space.
By their fourth or fifth year, many of the young jack pines are producing their first coneswhich by tree standards is markedly young. Why are they so precocious? Why not focus
their precious energy on more growth rather than on reproduction? Forest fires often
leave a lot of fuel behind, and sometimes a second fire quickly follows the first. It seems
a good idea to scatter a few seeds before the possible subsequent fire.
But it is the cones and seeds of the jack pine that are adapted most impressively and
specifically to fire. The cones are hard as iron, their scales tightly bound together with
what could be called a "resinous glue." Many creatures attack cones, but only the
American red squirrel will take on the jack pine cone, and even the red squirrel much
prefers the easier, fleshier meat of spruce cones. The cones may persist on the trees for
many years, and the seeds within them remain viable. In one study, more than half the
seeds from cones that were more than twenty years old were able to germinate. The
cones do not open until there is a fire: it takes the heat of 50C to melt the resin that locks
the scales together. Then, they open like flowers. Thus the seeds are not released until
the fire has cleared the ground of organic matter and of rivals and has created exactly the
conditions they need. The output is prodigious. After a fire in the taiga (the northernmost
forest, which then gives way to tundra), the burned ground may be scattered with twelve
million jack pine trees per acre.
Page 239 of 269
Although the cone responds to fire, and only to fire, it is remarkably fire resistant. It has
been found that the seeds inside would survive for thirty seconds even when the cone
was exposed to as much as 900C. It has also been shown that the cone does not respond
simply to the presence of fire, like some crude unmonitored mechanical device: rather, as
it is heated, it releases resin from within, which oozes to the surface and creates a gentle,
lamp-like flame around the cone, which lasts for about a minute and a half. All in all, it
seems that once ignited, the cone is programmed to provide a flame for the right amount
of time to open the cone.

59.2: Ziggurats in Mesopotamia
Like the pyramids of Egypt, the towers called “ziggurats” built in ancient Mesopotamia
were monumental symbols of a great civilization. Ziggurats consisted of several levels or
platforms of diminishing sizes with exterior stairways or ramps leading to their summits.
New platforms were built on top of older ones over many centuries, leaving earlier stages
buried under later enlargements. The Egyptian pyramids, however, were never meant to
be climbed, and new pyramids were not built over the remains of older ones.
Unlike in Egypt, there was no stone for building projects in Mesopotamia, but mudavailable everywhere-was used to produce bricks. Despite the availability of this cheap
building material, ziggurats were always considerably smaller than pyramids, possibly
due to a lack of manpower and wealth. The central core of most ziggurats consisted of
unbaked, sun-dried bricks covered with a thick outer shell of baked bricks. Water
occasionally leaked into the interior of a ziggurat, causing its unbaked core to expand and
crumble. All kings of Mesopotamia had to face the constant task of rebuilding mud-brick
structures; ziggurats, as well as other structures, rarely lasted a century without a major
renovation.
Why, then, were ziggurats not built entirely out of baked bricks instead of just their exterior
walls? If they had been, they could have withstood the ravages of time, and their kings
would not have been obliged to repair them every few years. As is so often the case,
environmental factors may have dictated the number of burnt mud bricks used in large
structures. There were very few trees in Mesopotamia, and the Mesopotamians lacked
the necessary fuel to bake the millions of bricks required for large structures. Most of the
wood and straw fuel available was used for cooking fires in private homes and could not
be spared for brick-making. Another factor that contributed to the demise of ziggurats was
the size of the bricks used to make them. Mud bricks are smaller and lighter than the
great stones used in pyramid construction and, long after they were abandoned, peasants
in search of easily available building material found ziggurats to be a convenient source
of bricks for constructing houses and other domestic buildings.
The purpose of Egyptian pyramids is clear: they were tombs for their deceased kings. But
if ziggurats were not tombs, then what was their purpose? Early explorers naively thought
that they were used by Mesopotamian priests to escape the mosquitoes. Some maintain
that the first small ziggurats were simply raised platforms where the village grain supply
could be kept dry during the annual flood. As early as the fourth millennium B.C., temples
were built on raised earth and mud-brick mounds, and ziggurats may have been a further
development of this type of construction. The most widely accepted explanation is that
ziggurats were meant to be climbed. Ziggurats always had several stairways leading to
their summits, and it seems clear that their primary purpose was to elevate the priests
closer to the realm of the gods in the heavens. In the city of Sippar, the ziggurat was
called “The Staircase to Holy Heaven,” and offerings were made to the gods from a small
temple at the summit of the ziggurat. In this way, ziggurats formed an important spiritual
Page 241 of 269
link between people on Earth and the sacred realm of the gods in the heavens.
In the early days of research on Mesopotamia, it was claimed that ziggurats were built as
celestial observatories where astronomers could have studied the stars without city
buildings obstructing their view. It is likely that on some occasions, celestial observers
climbed to the top of ziggurats to observe the night sky, recite prayers to the gods of the
night, and make offerings to the celestial gods. It should be kept in mind that, since the
moon and planets would still appear to be the same size, climbing a few meters to the top
of a ziggurat would not give an observer a significantly closer or better view of celestial
objects. It is doubtful that ziggurats would have been of much use to astronomers and
calendar-makers, but they would have elevated priests and celestial observers into the
higher spiritual realm that was such an important element of their religious world.

60.1: Bat Diets
One of the most dramatic measures of the diversity of bats is the variety of food they
consume. Although some 600 species eat insects as the main dietary staple, others live
on fruit, nectar and pollen, fish, frogs, birds, small mammals, blood, and even other bats.
Most of this diversity occurs in the tropics, although many bats from temperate regions
vary their diets by eating a wide range of insects.
What any bat eats is determined by two important factors: the need for enough energy to
keep the body going and the need for essential chemicals to maintain it. Just as an
automobile requires fuel to move and lubricants to keep the engine running smoothly,
animals require protein, carbohydrates, or fat for energy, along with vitamins and minerals
to stay healthy. Since it is essential for bats to consume enough calories to make flight,
reproduction, growth, and other bodily functions possible, it is easy to see why such
variety is necessary in their diets. Species that feed mainly on plant products require
protein, which can be obtained by eating animals (insects), pollen (which provides only
moderate amounts of protein), or large quantities of fruit (a very limited source of protein).
Bats feeding on insects appear to obtain a balanced diet from this source of nutrition.
To obtain the energy and chemicals they need, bats consume vast quantities of food.
Small insectivorous species (species that eat mainly insects) eat at least 30 percent of
their body weight each night they are active, and in nursing mothers, the amount may
exceed 50 percent. These figures appear to apply to all bats, regardless of diet. It may
not be impressive to learn that a little brown bat eats three grams of insects on a summer
night, but to find 150 mosquitoes in its stomach certainly is, especially when you realize
they are not an entire night's ration and the bat probably caught them in less than fifteen
minutes. The most impressive statistic of insect consumption comes from Texas, where it
is estimated that a local population of Mexican free-tailed bats eats slightly more than
6,000 tons of insects each summer.
The basic design of a bat imposes certain restrictions on the range of food available to it.
Bats determine the direction and distance of objects in their environment by emitting highpitched sounds and interpreting their echoes to find their location-the term for this is
echolocation. Because they can echolocate, New World leaf-nosed bats that feed mainly
on fruit are able to catch insects to supplement their diet with protein. Flying foxes (a
species of bat found mainly in Indonesia and Malaysia) and their relatives, however, do
not echolocate and must obtain their protein from something other than insects. Recent
studies in the Ivory Coast by the Canadian biologist Donald Thomas suggest that several
species of the herbivorous bat family pteropodidae get their protein from the fruit that
composes the main part of their diet. The levels of protein in the fruit are low, but this is
countered by the consumption of large quantities of fruit and by enzymes in the digestive
tract that efficiently extract what little protein is available. Size is also a factor in
determining the diet of a bat; a 3-gram butterfly bat has fewer prey species from which to
choose than a 40-gram, large slit-faced bat. As a rule, smaller bats are almost entirely
Page 243 of 269
insectivorous, and larger species include larger prey in their diet, readily switching to small
vertebrates such as fish, birds, and frogs. The smallest bats that feed on plant material
are nectar and pollen feeders. Larger species more often feed on fruit but may also
supplement their diet with nectar and pollen.
The food selected by bats also depends on where they feed. Flying bats chasing flying
insects will not catch scorpions that do not fly, but they often snatch spiders ballooning on
pieces of web. Bats feeding on stationary or terrestrial prey often catch resting insects
that are able to fly. Bats concentrating their feeding activity over water catch more aquatic
insects than those feeding high over the forest, and species hunting over water have
opportunities to catch fish not available to high-flying species that visit the water only to
drink.

60.2: Continuous Script and Oral Culture in Europe
Today people commonly read in silence and in private, but that was not the case in Europe
during the periods of ancient Greece (800-146 B.C.E.), ancient Rome (753 B.C.E. -476
C.E.), and the centuries that followed. In ancient Greek times, reading was an oral
(spoken) practice--one reflected in writing itself. Greek texts were written in a continuous
script (without spaces between words) and with minimal punctuation; this both required
and rewarded sounding them aloud. A continuous script could not have developed without
the Greek introduction of letters for vowels, which allowed readers to identify syllables
and hold them in memory as the eye moved across the text.
Though it seems awkward to us now, the continuous script was not a natural construction,
but a choice, as demonstrated by the fact that the Romans discarded their own
punctuation in the first century in favor of the Greek model. It established literacy (ability
to read and write) as the domain of a cultured elite, who either studied from a young age
to master the skills appropriate for reading each individual text or employed a professional
reader, or lector, for the task. It also facilitated a culture of shared inquiry, in which
challenging texts were read aloud in groups as an incentive for debate. In ancient Greece,
literature was primarily a social activity, with audiences gathering for performances of epic
poetry and drama. Epic poems bear the hallmarks of this orality: they rely on repetition,
formulaic images, meter, and rhyme as mnemonic (memory) aids to the performer. The
term used to describe performances of such works, rhapsody, means “to stitch together"
-suggesting the extent to which oral composition relies on weaving familiar lines.
The great thinkers of ancient Greece, in fact, mistrusted writing as a technology that would
destroy the oral arts of debate and storytelling on which they based their sense of the
world, philosophy, and time and space. In Plato's dramatic play Phaedrus, the philosopher
Socrates looks down on the written word for separating ideas from their source, citing
Egyptian king Thamus as the first to voice this concern when he received the gift of writing
from the god Thoth. Transcription (writing speech down), Socrates fears, is an aid that
will both interfere with memory and trap philosophical thought in ambiguity, leaving
interpretation in the hands of the reader. Texts, after all, can circulate without their author,
thus preventing one from explaining or defending them. Despite these fears, the very
writing Plato used to record his works proved instrumental in the development of ancient
Greek oratory (the art of speech-making). As scholar Walter Ong points out in Orality and
Literacy, his study of the ways writing technologies restructure consciousness, the written
word enabled Greek scholars to transcribe and codify effective rhetorical (speaking)
strategies. It also vastly increased human vocabulary, since we no longer had to rely on
memory to hold all of the language for immediate use. Writing, in fact, allowed rhetoric to
flourish.
For the kind of silent reading we now experience to take hold, reading would have to
change its context and text its form. It would have to become a more private experience,
which means literacy would have to extend beyond the elite and monastic (religious)
Page 245 of 269
communities. Texts, too, would need to become more legible, with standardized
punctuation and word spaces so that the mumbling of readers sounding out text, common
through the sixth century, could disappear. And libraries designed for quiet, contemplative
reading could then develop to serve this new readership.
British scribes, like those who crafted the Book of Kells (around 800 C.E.), played a key
role in making the text more accessible. They wrote in Latin, and because it was a second
language, and one more challenging to sound out in continuous script, they introduced
several changes to improve its legibility, including word separation (around 675 C.E.),
additional punctuation, and simplified letterforms.
Still, it took nearly four hundred years for these small innovations to spread. The
translation of Arabic scientific writing into Latin in tenth-century Europe likely played a vital
role in solidifying word separation, since it was inherent in the language (because, unlike
Greek and Latin, it is written in consonants). Translators kept Arabic word separation
when rendering these texts in Latin, in part because it made the complex technical prose
significantly more comprehensible.

61.1: Tern Hunting of Fish
Terns are a group of bird species that hunt fish close to the water's surface. Fish have
adaptations to avoid being eaten, including cryptic coloration (most fish are dark along
the back, even if they are silvery on the sides), habitually swimming at depths below those
at which they are in danger from above, and taking evasive action if they see a bird diving
toward them. Terns have their own cryptic coloration, most having white or light grey
underparts so that they are difficult to see from below the surface, and they dive vertically
toward the fish at the highest possible speeds.
Terns also have to learn to adjust for parallax: sunlight changes direction at the air-water
interface, which makes fish always appear to be at shallower depths than they really are.
This is an especially difficult problem when the water surface is wavy, which makes the
image of the fish move around horizontally as well as vertically-as one can see by looking
down from a bridge or dock into rippled water. Terns must learn by trial and error to
compensate for parallax and dive accurately toward a target that appears to be moving
unpredictably. It has been shown that terns' success in catching fish declines with
increasing wind speed, presumably because increasing waviness of the surface makes
the fish increasingly hard to locate. At the other extreme, terns' fishing success declines
again at very low wind speeds, either because the terns have more difficulty hovering to
locate the fish in still air, or because the fish can see the terns more easily when the
surface is smooth. Except in the most favorable circumstances, terns' fishing success is
usually quite low-typically only one fish caught for every three or four dives, with many
attempts broken off even before the tern hits the water.
At most times and in most places, terns are unable to catch fish because the fish are
swimming deeper below the surface than the terns can dive. Terns' ability to catch fish
usually depends on factors that bring the fish toward the surface. Many fishes follow
vertical movements of their invertebrate prey, or zooplankton (tiny water-based animals),
but these prey habitually come to the surface at night when terns are usually unable to
catch fish. Sand eels, one of the main prey species for terns, come to the surface to
spawn (lay eggs), and several other fishes spawn in shallow water near the shore. These
spawning events provide good opportunities for terns to catch fish, but they are usually
localized and transitory. Fish larvae and juvenile fish are more likely to swim near the
surface than adult fish, but these prey are often too small to be good food sources for
terns.
An important factor that brings larger fish close to the surface is the vertical movements
of the water caused by currents running over obstacles or through narrow passages.
Terns regularly concentrate over tide “races" such as that at Dungeness, England, where
currents running around narrow strips of land generate turbulent eddies (circular currents)
that bring fish to the surface, or at gaps in barrier beaches such as those of the north
Norfolk coast (also in England), where tidal currents running in and out twice each day
produce similar eddies. Other sites suitable for tern feeding are where tidal currents run
Page 247 of 269
around islands or over shallow rocks, reefs, or sandbars, bringing fish close to the surface
at predictable times of the tidal cycle. Roseate terns, in particular, feed regularly over such
places, and in some areas, travel long distances to feed at sites where fish can be caught
predictably.
The most widespread factor making fish come toward the surface, however, is predatory
fish chasing them from below. In many coastal areas, flocks of terns gather over schools
(groups) of predatory fish and follow them as they feed, diving frantically in the short
intervals when the prey fish are forced close to the surface by the predators pursuing
them from below. Many tropical terns habitually follow tuna, bonito, or other predatory fish
that hunt in schools. The sooty tern is thought to be dependent for much of the year on
tuna and the dolphins that accompany them, ranging widely over tropical oceans and
coming together wherever the tuna come near the surface to feed.

61.2: Chaco Canyon
Archaeologists have discovered that the Anasazi civilization of present-day southwestern
United States flourished even after environmental problems had reduced crop production
and virtually eliminated timber supplies in Chaco Canyon, the center of the Anasazi
population. Despite these problems, or because of the solutions the Anasazi found for
them, the canyon's population continued to increase, particularly during a big spurt
(sudden and brief increase) of construction that began in A.D. 1029. Such spurts went on,
especially during wet decades when more rain meant more food, more people, and more
need for buildings. A dense population is attested not only by the famous great houses
(such as Pueblo Bonito) spaced about a mile apart on the north side of Chaco Canyon,
but also by holes drilled into the northern cliff face to support roof beams, indicating a
continuous line of residences at the base of the cliffs between the great houses, and by
the remains of hundreds of small settlements on the south side of the canyon. The size
of the canyon's total population remains unknown and much debated. Many
archaeologists think that it was less than 5,000 and that those enormous buildings had
few permanent occupants except priests and were just visited seasonally by peasants at
the time of rituals. Other archaeologists note that Pueblo Bonito, which is just one of the
large houses at Chaco Canyon, by itself was a building of 600 rooms and that all those
post holes suggest dwellings for much of the length of the canyon, thus implying a
population much greater than 5,000. Such debates about estimated population sizes arise
frequently in archaeology.
Whatever the number, this dense population could no longer support itself but was
subsidized by outlying satellite settlements constructed in similar architectural styles and
joined to Chaco Canyon by a radiating regional network of hundreds of miles of roads
that are still visible today. Those outliers had dams to catch rain, which fell unpredictably
and very patchily; a thunderstorm might produce abundant rain in one desert area and no
rain in another area just a mile away. The dams meant that when a particular area was
fortunate enough to receive a rainstorm, much of the rainwater became stored behind the
dam, and people living there could quickly plant crops, irrigate, and grow a huge surplus
of food in that area in that year. The surplus could then feed people living at all the other
outliers that did not happen to receive rain then.
Chaco Canyon became a black hole into which goods were imported but from which
nothing tangible was exported. Into Chaco Canyon came tens of thousands of big trees
for construction; pottery (all late-period pottery in Chaco Canyon was imported, probably
because exhaustion of local firewood supplies precluded firing pots within the canyon
itself); stone of good quality for making stone tools; turquoise from other areas of New
Mexico for making ornaments; and macaws (parrots), shell jewelry, and copper bells from
the Hohokam and from Mexico, as luxury goods. Even food had to be imported from
places as far as 50 to 60 miles away, as shown by a recent study tracing the origins of
corncobs excavated from Pueblo Bonito.
Page 249 of 269
Chaco society turned into a mini-empire, divided between a well-fed elite living in luxury
and a less well-fed peasantry doing the work and raising the food. The road system and
the regional extent of standardized architecture testify to the large size of the area over
which the economy and culture of Chaco and its outliers were regionally integrated.
Why would outlying settlements have supported the Chaco center, dutifully delivering
timber, pottery, stone, turquoise, and food without receiving anything material in return?
The answer is probably the same as the reason why outlying areas of Italy and Britain
today support cities such as Rome and London, which also produce no timber or food but
serve as political and religious centers. Like the modern Italians and British, Chacoans
were now irreversibly committed to living in a complex, interdependent society. They could
no longer revert to their original condition of self-supporting mobile little groups, because
the trees in the canyon were gone, irrigation was impossible, and the growing population
had filled up the region and left no unoccupied suitable areas to which to move.

62.1: Energy Distribution in Plants
Annuals are plants that go through their entire life cycle within a single year. Annuals
begin their life cycles in the spring when seeds that survived the winter germinate (begin
to grow). In regions with distinct dry and wet seasons, germination occurs with the onset
of the rainy season. Because it has only one growing season, an annual has to distribute
its photosynthates (energy-rich molecules) first to leaves. Leaves, in turn, become
involved in photosynthesis, which replenishes the supply of photosynthates and increases
overall plant biomass. At the time of flowering, the plant decreases the amount of energy
distributed to leaves and diverts most of its photosynthate to reproduction. For example,
in the sunflower, the biomass of leaves declines from approximately 60 percent of the
total plant weight during the period of growth to 10 to 20 percent by the time the seeds
are ripe. When in bloom, the sunflower distributes 90 percent of its photosynthate to the
flower head and the remainder to the leaves, stem, and roots.
Perennial plants maintain a vegetative structure over several years. Once established,
they distribute their energy in a very different manner from annuals. Before perennials
expend any energy on reproduction, they divert photosynthate to the roots. This
distribution to roots is in excess of that required for the development of roots for the uptake
of nutrients and water from the soil. In some species, such as the skunk cabbage, the
roots develop into large storage organs. Energy stored in the roots makes up a reserve
upon which the plants draw when they begin growth the following growing season. When
they are ready to flower, perennials divert energy from storage to the production of flowers
and fruit. As the flowers fade and the fruits ripen, the plant once more sends
photosynthate to the roots to build up the reserves it will need for the following spring.
Trees and woody shrubs live a long time, which greatly influences the manner in which
they distribute energy. Early in life, leaves make up more than one-half of their biomass;
however, as trees age, they accumulate more woody growth. Trunks and stems become
thicker and heavier, and the ratio of leaves to woody tissue changes. Eventually, leaves
account for only 1 to 5 percent of the total mass of the tree. The production system (the
leaf mass) that supplies the energy is considerably less than the rest of the biomass it
supports. Thus, as the woody plant grows, much of the energy goes into support and
maintenance, which increases as the plant ages.
When deciduous trees (trees that lose their foliage in winter) produce leaves again in the
spring, they expend up to one-third of their reserve energy on the growth and expansion
of leaves. This expenditure is repaid as the leaves carry out photosynthesis during the
spring and summer. After leaves, trees give preference to flowers; then tissues that
transport nutrients and water, new leaf buds, deposits of starch in roots and bark, and
finally, new flower buds.
Evergreen trees have a somewhat different approach. Many have fine, sharp-pointed
leaves called “needles." Because the photosynthetic tissues in these needles can function
Page 251 of 269
year-round when temperature and moisture conditions permit, they do not need to draw
on root reserves for new growth in the spring. They can afford to wait until later in the
growing season to produce new growth. Then evergreens can draw upon energy built up
earlier in the spring. For the same reason, new growth develops rapidly and matures
within a few weeks.
Reproduction and vegetative growth compete for energy allotments. If photosynthesis is
limited, vegetative growth gets the first claim. Because the energy that reproduction
demands is high-up to 15 percent in pines, 20 percent in deciduous trees, and 35 percent
or more in fruit trees-trees can afford an abundance of fruit only periodically, once every
two to three years in deciduous trees and two to six years in evergreens.
The proportionate distribution of net production to above-ground and below-ground
biomass tells much about different ecosystems. Low light conditions favor the distribution
of energy to the production of leaves and stems at the expense of roots. A reduction in
water or nutrient availability favors the distribution of energy to the roots.

62.2: The Early American Economy
In the sixteenth century, settlers from England, a part of Britain, began to colonize North
America. These colonies remained under British control until the American Revolution,
which occurred at the end of the eighteenth century. The economic theory of mercantilism
that was dominant from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century, held that colonies should
benefit the mother country by helping her become self-sufficient and wealthy. Beginning
in the 1650s, the British Parliament passed a series of laws relating to the American
colonies that were designed to advance those goals. Colonists were required to buy
goods only from English merchants using English ships operated by English crews. The
laws stated that certain products, such as tobacco, rice, and indigo, could be sold only in
England and nowhere else. On the other hand, colonial agricultural products that
competed with those produced by English farmers, such as wheat or meat, could not be
sold in England.
The mercantile system was designed to profit the colonizers-not the colonies-and
Americans grumbled about some aspects of it and evaded some of its regulations. But
on balance, the colonies probably benefited from it. For one thing, it gave colonial
producers of protected goods a monopoly in the British market, and English economic
energy and strength maintained a vigorous resale trade in American commodities on the
European continent. Also, the producers of some commodities received the inducement
of a cash subsidy, called a bounty, that profited them immensely. Finally, all American
trade benefited from a strong British commercial and financial infrastructure and from the
physical protection provided by the powerful British navy, which controlled the North
Atlantic. The British connection was especially helpful in the second third of the eighteenth
century, when English and European prosperity and population growth led to increased
demand for American products. The British even lowered their barriers to American
foodstuffs, creating a new market for colonial farmers.
This prosperity had a generally positive, if uneven, effect on American standards of living.
As productive people enjoying extensive use of a rich resource base and taking
advantage of growing market opportunities, the colonists probably lived as well as any
people anywhere. For the colonies as a whole, per capita wealth on the eve of the
Revolution was only slightly lower than in England, and in some places—Pennsylvania,
for example-was actually higher.
As a consequence, Americans were progressively better fed, clothed, and housed. They
drank coffee, tea, and rum, flavored their food with sugar and spices, and wore clothes
constructed from imported textiles. They enjoyed luxuries their parents and grandparents
had been unable to acquire, such as glass windows, china, silver candlesticks, and lace.
Especially attractive to colonial consumers were luxury foods for the table, an indication
that they were entertaining guests and perhaps that women were playing an important
role in purchasing decisions.
Page 253 of 269
Prosperity fueled expectations among colonists and prospective colonists. Immigrants
poured in to share the American bounty, not only from England but from Ireland, Scotland,
and Germany. Farmers bought and cleared more land and hired labor. Planters went into
debt for luxuries, assuming that the upward economic trend minimized their risk.
The problem with discussing broad trends in economies or the economic behavior of
people in the aggregate is that it leads us to lose sight of important qualifications and
distinctions. The first and perhaps the most important qualification that must be made
involves farmers' behavior and intent. Virtually all colonial farmers-including even the
most substantial planters-practiced a safety-first agriculture that was modified only slowly
and incompletely by growing commercial opportunities. The essential goal of most
farmers was not to fill a market demand but to provide sufficiency for their families and
dependents. It was their first priority to feed their families from their own flocks and fields,
clothe their families with thread spun and cloth woven at home, and warm their families
from their own woodlots. Self-sufficiency is not the same as subsistence, however, and
most farmers produced some sort of surplus for the market most of the time. Market
involvement was necessary because few farmers could produce enough of everything
their families consumed. Hence, one might sell surplus wheat to purchase another's
surplus apples or to buy a cooking pot. Moreover, farmers needed a surplus to generate
profits to pay taxes, and they wanted a surplus in order to buy those luxuries that would
make their lives more attractive.

3.1: The Mycenaean Collapse
The Mycenaean culture of ancient Greece, with major centers at Mycenae and Pylos on
the Greek mainland and Knossus on the island of Crete in the Aegean Sea, was at its
height from 1400 B.C.E. to 1200 B.C.E., with growing cities, thriving trade, and a
prosperous economy. Around 1200 B.C.E., however, the Mycenaean world showed signs
of great trouble, and by 1100 B.C.E., it was gone. Its palaces were destroyed, many of its
cities were abandoned, and its art, patterns of life, and system of writing were buried and
forgotten.
What happened? Some recent scholars, noting evidence that the Aegean island of Thira
(modern Santorini) suffered a massive volcanic explosion in the middle to late second
millennium B.C.E., have suggested that this natural disaster was responsible. According
to one version of the theory, the explosion occurred around 1400 B.C.E., blackening and
poisoning the air for many miles around and sending a monstrous tidal wave that
destroyed the great palace at Knossus and, with it, Minoan culture. According to another
version, the explosion took place about 1200 B.C.E., destroying the Bronze Age culture
throughout the Aegean Sea region. This second version conveniently accounts for the
end of both the Mycenaean and Minoan civilizations in a single blow, but the evidence
does not support it. The Mycenaean towns were not destroyed all at once; many fell
around 1200 B.C.E., but some flourished for another century, and the Athens of the period
was never destroyed or abandoned. No theory of natural disaster can account for this
pattern, leaving us to seek less dramatic explanations for the end of Mycenaean
civilization.
Some scholars have suggested that sea raiders destroyed Pylos and, perhaps, other sites
on the mainland. The Greeks themselves believed in a legend that told of the Dorians, a
rude people from the north who spoke a Greek dialect different from that of the
Mycenaean peoples. According to the legend, the Dorians joined with one of the Greek
tribes, the Heraclidae, in an attack on the southern Greek peninsula of Peloponnese,
which was repulsed. One hundred years later, they returned and gained full control.
Recent historians have identified this legend of the return of the Heraclidae with a Dorian
invasion.
Archaeology has not provided material evidence of whether there was a single Dorian
invasion or a series of them, and it is impossible to say yet with any certainty what
happened at the end of the Bronze Age in the Aegean Sea region. The chances are good,
however, that Mycenaean civilization ended gradually over the century between 1200
B.C.E. and 1100 B.C.E. Its end may have been the result of internal conflicts among the
Mycenaean kings combined with continuous pressure from outsiders, who raided,
infiltrated, and eventually dominated Greece and its neighboring islands. There is reason
to believe that Mycenaean society suffered internal weaknesses because of its
organization around the centralized control of military force and agricultural production.
This rigid organization may have deprived it of flexibility and vitality, leaving it vulnerable
Page 255 of 269
to outside challengers.
The immediate effects of the Dorian invasion were disastrous for the inhabitants of the
Mycenaean world. The palaces and the kings and bureaucrats who managed them were
destroyed. The wealth and organization that had supported the artists and merchants
were, likewise, swept away by a barbarous people who did not have the knowledge or
social organization to maintain them. Many villages were abandoned and never resettled.
Some of their inhabitants probably turned to a nomadic life, and many perished.
Another result of the invasion was the spread of Greek people eastward from the
mainland to the Aegean islands and the coast of Asia Minor. The Dorians themselves,
after occupying most of the Peloponnese, swept across the Aegean Sea region to occupy
the southern islands and the southern part of the Anatolian coast. These migrations made
the Aegean Sea a Greek lake. Trade with the old civilizations of the Near East, however,
was virtually ended by the fall of the Minoan and Mycenaean civilizations, nor was there
much internal trade among the different parts of Greece. The Greeks were forced to turn
inward, and each community was left largely to maintain itself.

63.2: Examining the Diets of Prehistoric People
One of the most important pieces of information about prehistoric people is the nature of
their diet. This information is especially relevant when trying to answer questions related
to the origins and development of agriculture. Archaeologists can approach diet in a
number of ways. They can study diet indirectly by figuring out what people might have
eaten based on what was available in their natural environment. For example, deer, duck,
turkey, and fish are known to have been available in what is now the northeastern United
States for about 7,000 years. Hunting-and-gathering people in this area are likely to have
used such resources at one time or another. The weakness of this method of reasoning
is that we cannot know with certainty which of the available foods were most important in
the diet.
On the other hand, archaeologists can approach the question of diet more directly if there
has been good preservation. In many instances, food remains themselves are still present
in archaeological sites. Archaeologists can study the fireplaces and garbage heaps of the
people who lived at a site and recover food material if it has been preserved. Such
remains as bone, seeds, and nuts are often fragile and fragmentary, however, making it
difficult to get them out of the ground and back to the lab for identification and analysis.
In many cases, an archaeologist takes the entire feature, including all soil, back to the
laboratory, instead of attempting to separate the dry soil matrix from the fragile
archaeological remains in the field. In the lab, through a number of different procedures
collectively called flotation, the archaeologist uses liquid to do the job of separation, taking
advantage of the fact that soil and rock will not float in some liquids, whereas organic
remains will.
The next task in the reconstruction of a prehistoric diet is the identification of the species
of plant or animal represented by the remains. This task can be difficult because of the
fragmentary nature of such remains and the changes in them as they decay. In some
cases, no precise identification can be made-the piece of bone is too small or the seed
too broken up to tell what it is with any degree of confidence. But by comparing the
fragment to items in a “library" of bones, nuts, and seeds, archaeologists can often identify
many of the dietary remains found at a site.
The examination of the animal remains found at a site is called faunal analysis. Here, the
species represented, their sex, ages at death, health, and physical characteristics are
identified. Knowing the species of the remains as well as their age, sex, and health status,
can provide insight into the hunting practices of prehistoric people. Were the people
hunting large numbers of herd animals in group hunts, or were their prey solitary creatures
that could be hunted by individual hunters? Were the ancient people able to kill large
animals in their prime or only those that were very young, very old, or sick? Also, because
many animals give birth to their young seasonally, knowing the age at death of a young
animal helps determine the season of the hunt. For example, the North American whitetailed deer usually gives birth to its young in May or June. If the bones of a deer found at
Page 257 of 269
an archaeological site indicate an age of nine months, the animal must have been killed,
and the site was most probably occupied, in February or March.
Information about diet can sometimes be gathered from an animal's teeth and bones. For
example, in mammals, teeth provide clues to overall food sources. Carnivores such as
dogs and cats, for example, have slicing teeth adapted to meat eating. Humans have a
more generalized dentition, built for chewing a variety of foods. Certain wear patterns on
the teeth, examined microscopically, can reveal whether the diet was made up of soft
foods such as fruits or more abrasive foods such as roots and tubers. Prehistoric bones
can be analyzed to determine what proportion of their chemical composition is strontium
and calcium; this information can be used to determine whether plants or meat made up
the bulk of the diet of certain populations.

64.1: The Development of Factories
One of the most enduring images of the eighteenth and nineteenth-century British
Industrial Revolution is that of the large factory, filled with workers laboring amid massive
machinery driven by either water or steam power. Mechanized factory production evolved
out of forms of industry that had emerged only during the early modern period (1500-
1750). In the Middle Ages, virtually all industry in Europe was undertaken by skilled
craftsmen belonging to urban guilds, and these artisans, working either by themselves or
with the assistance of apprentices or journeymen, produced everything from candlesticks
and hats to oxcarts and beds. During the early modern period, the urban craftsman's shop
gave way to two different types of industrial workplaces, the rural cottage and the large
handicraft workshop. Both of these served as halfway houses, or transitional stages, to
the large factory.
Beginning in the sixteenth century, entrepreneurs began employing families in the
countryside to spin and weave cloth and make nails and cutlery. By locating industry in
the countryside, the entrepreneurs were able to escape the regulations imposed by the
guilds regarding employment and the price of finished products. They also paid lower
wages, because the rural workers, who also received an income from farming, were
willing to work for less than the residents of towns. Another attraction of rural industry was
that all the members of the family, including children, participated in the process. In this
“domestic system," a capitalist entrepreneur provided the workers with the raw materials
and sometimes the tools they needed. He later paid them a fixed rate for each finished
product. The entrepreneur was also responsible for having the finished cloth dyed and for
marketing the commodities in regional towns.
The rural household industry was widespread not only in certain regions of Britain but
also in most European countries. In the late eighteenth century, it gradually gave way to
the factory system. The great attraction of factory production was mechanization, which
became cost-efficient only when it was introduced in a central industrial workplace. In
factories, moreover, the entrepreneur could reduce the cost of labor and transportation,
exercise tighter control over the quality of goods, and increase productivity by
concentrating workers in one location. Temporary labor shortages sometimes made the
transition from rural industry to factory production imperative.
The second type of industrial workplace that emerged during the early modern period was
the large handicraft workshop. Usually located in the towns and cities rather than in the
countryside, these workshops employed relatively small numbers of people with different
skills who worked collectively on the manufacture of a variety of items, such as pottery
and munitions. The owner of the workshop supplied the raw materials, paid the workers'
wages, and gained a profit from selling the finished products.
The large handicraft workshop made possible a division of labor- the assignment of one
stage of production to each worker or group of workers. The effect of the division of labor
Page 259 of 269
on productivity was evident even in the manufacture of simple items such as buttons and
pins. In The Wealth of Nations (1776), the economist Adam Smith (1723-1790) used a
pin factory in London to illustrate how the division of labor could increase per capita
productivity from no more than twenty pins a day to the astonishing total of 4,800.
Like the cottages engaged in rural industry, the large handicraft workshop eventually gave
way to the mechanized factory. The main difference between the workshop and the
factory was that the factory did not require a body of skilled workers. When production
became mechanized, the worker's job was simply to tend to the machinery. The only skill
factory workers needed was manual dexterity to operate the machinery. Only those
workers who made industrial machinery remained craftsmen or skilled workers in the
traditional sense of the word.
With the advent of mechanization, factory owners gained much tighter control over the
entire production process. Indeed, they began to enforce unprecedented discipline
among their workers, who had to accommodate themselves to the boredom of repetitive
work and a timetable set by the machines. Craftsmen who had been accustomed to
working at their own pace now had to adjust to an entirely new and demanding schedule.
Page 260 of 269
64.2: Causes of Glacial Ages
Any theory that attempts to explain the causes of glacial ages must successfully address
two basic questions. First, what causes the onset of glacial conditions? For ice sheets to
have formed, average temperatures must have been somewhat lower than at present
and perhaps substantially lower than throughout much of geologic time. For that reason,
a successful explanation would have to account for the gradual cooling that finally leads
to glacial conditions. The second question is: What caused the alternation of glacial and
interglacial stages that have been documented for the Pleistocene epoch (1.6 million to
10,000 years ago)? Whereas the first question deals with long-term trends in temperature
that occur on a scale of millions of years, this second question relates to much shorterterm changes.
Probably the most attractive proposal for explaining why extensive glaciations have
occurred only a few times in the geologic past comes from the theory of plate tectonics.
Not only does this theory provide geologists with explanations about many previously
misunderstood processes and features, it also provides a possible explanation for some
previously unexplainable climatic changes, including the onset of glacial conditions. Since
glaciers can form only on land, we know that landmasses must exist somewhere in the
higher latitudes before an ice age can commence. Many believe that ice ages have only
occurred when Earth's shifting crustal plates carried the continents from tropical latitudes
to more poleward positions.
Glacial features in present-day Africa, Australia, South America, and India indicate that
these regions experienced an ice age near the end of the Paleozoic era, about 250 million
years ago. For many years, this puzzled scientists. Was the climate in these relatively
tropical latitudes once like it is today in Greenland and Antarctica? Why did glaciers not
form in North America and Eurasia? Until the plate tectonics theory was formulated and
proven, there was no reasonable explanation. Today, scientists realize that the areas
containing these ancient glacial features were joined together as a single supercontinent
called Pangaea, that was located at high latitudes far to the south of their present
positions. Later, this landmass broke apart, and its pieces, each moving on a different
plate, drifted toward their present locations. It is now believed that during the geologic
past, plate movements accounted for many dramatic climatic changes as landmasses
shifted in relation to one another and moved to different latitudinal positions. Changes in
oceanic circulation also must have occurred, altering the transport of heat and moisture
and, consequently, the climate as well. Since the rate of plate movement is very slow, on
the order of a few centimeters per year, appreciable changes in the positions of the
continents occur only over great spans of geologic time.
Since climatic changes brought about by moving plates are extremely gradual, the plate
tectonics theory cannot explain the alternation of glacial and interglacial climates that
occurred during the Pleistocene epoch. Therefore, we must look to some other triggering
mechanism that may cause climatic change on a scale of thousands rather than millions
Page 261 of 269
of years. Today, many scientists believe, or strongly suspect, that the climatic oscillations
that characterized the Pleistocene may be linked to variations in Earth's orbit. This
hypothesis was first developed and advocated by the Yugoslavian scientist Milutin
Milankovitch and is based on the premise that variation in incoming solar radiation is a
principal factor in controlling Earth's climate. Milankovitch formulated a comprehensive
mathematical model based on the following elements: variations in the shape
(eccentricity) of Earth's orbit around the Sun; changes in obliquity, that is, changes in the
angle that Earth's axis makes with the plane of Earth's orbit; and the unsteady wobbling
of Earth's axis, called precession.
Using these three factors, Milankovitch calculated variations in the seasonal timing of the
receipt of solar energy and the corresponding surface temperature of Earth over a long
period of time in an attempt to correlate these changes with the climatic fluctuations of
the Pleistocene. In explaining climatic changes that result from these three variables, it
should be noted that they cause little or no variation in the total amount of solar energy
annually reaching the ground. Instead, their impact is felt because they change the
degree of contrast between seasons. Somewhat milder winters in the middle to high
latitudes mean greater snowfall totals, while cooler summers would bring a reduction in
snowmelt.
Page 262 of 269
65.1: Imitation in Child Development
When does imitation become possible? How important is this ability in the learning of
infants and children? Andrew Meltzoff and M. Keith Moore argue that even newborns and
very young infants imitate a variety of responses, including tongue protrusion, mouth
opening, and possibly even facial expressions portraying such emotions as happiness,
sadness, and surprise. Although some investigators have been unable to replicate these
results, many others, including the authors of one study involving infants from Nepal,
report a high degree of imitative competence in newborns.
Even more controversial is what imitative behaviors mean. The influential Swiss
psychologist Jean Piaget, for example, claimed infants younger than eight to twelve
months could imitate someone else's behavior only when able to see themselves making
these responses. Because babies do not ordinarily view their own faces, imitative facial
gestures would be impossible, according to Piaget, until after about a year of age, when
symbolic capacities (abilities to use a symbol, an object, or a word to stand for something)
emerge. From this perspective, then, the facial gestures that infants younger than a year
make in response to a model's facial expression are stereotyped, rigid responses set off
by or linked to limited forms of stimulation rather than imitations of what the child has
seen. For example, perhaps tongue protrusion by a model arouses the infant, which in
turn promotes a sucking response that naturally invokes tongue protrusion from the infant.
If this is the case, infants could be responding to just a few types of stimuli and producing
a kind of reflexive (automatic) motor activity that is not really a form of imitation.
Meltzoff and Moore counter that very young infants imitate a variety of responses, modify
their imitations to increasingly match the modeled behavior over time, and exhibit their
imitations primarily to other people and not to inanimate objects. These arguments
contradict the view that such behaviors are simply a fixed pattern of reflexive actions.
They propose instead that infants imitate in order to prolong interaction with others. In
fact, babies as young as six weeks will imitate the behaviors of a model up to twenty-four
hours later. Such imitation is a way to continue the earlier imitative communication with
the model. If this interpretation is correct, imitation has an important social-communicative
function and is one of the earliest games babies play with other people.
Between six and twelve months of age, infants display far more frequent and precise
imitations, matching a wide range of modeled behaviors. Piaget and others believed that
deferred imitation, the ability to imitate well after some activity has been demonstrated, is
not possible until about eighteen to twenty- four months of age. Piaget believed deferred
imitation, along with pretend play and the emergence of language, marks an important
transition from one stage of thinking to the next and provides one of the first major pieces
of evidence for symbolic capacities. However, as we have already seen, Meltzoff and
Moore claim infants as young as six weeks can reproduce a model's behavior a day after
seeing it.
Page 263 of 269
Deferred imitation involving actions associated with objects can also be observed far
earlier than Piaget claimed. For example, six-month-olds will remove a mitten from a
puppet's hand, shake it, and try to put it back on the puppet after observing this sequence
of actions performed by a model twenty-four hours earlier. Moreover, toddlers as young
as fourteen months who see a peer pulling, pushing, poking, and inserting toys in the
laboratory or at a daycare center will reproduce the behaviors in their own homes as much
as two days later when given the same toys. The capacity for deferred imitation, then,
appears to exist much sooner than previously assumed. In fact, the results are consistent
with research on memory, showing that infants younger than one year can recognize
stimuli hours and even days later. The observances of imitation at very young ages are
important from a social learning perspective, providing clear and compelling evidence that
infants, as well as older children, learn many new behaviors by observing others.

65.2: Birds and Food Shortage
The term “food shortage" has been used for food that is inadequate in quantity, quality, or
availability. Whatever the abundance of food in the environment, if it is for some reason
unavailable, bird species in either inland or coastal areas may starve. Food sources like
intertidal invertebrates retreat deeper in the mud in cold weather, putting them beyond the
reach of shorebirds, while many soil-dwelling invertebrates move deeper into the ground
during drought. Such behaviors illustrate the general points that only a proportion of
potential food items may be accessible to birds at any one time, and that this proportion
may change through time in response to other conditions. Secondly, if food is plentiful but
of low nutrient content or digestibility, a bird may be unable to process enough each day
to maintain its weight. This is particularly true of herbivores (plant eaters) eating fibrous,
or coarse vegetation, and food shortage may arise partly from the structure of a bird's
inner parts, or gut, which limits the rate at which food can be processed. In general,
among birds, species differences in gut structure correspond with dietary differences, and
in species whose diet changes seasonally, the gut structure may change accordingly. The
need for change in gut structure can make some species vulnerable at times of rapid shift
in diet, as when snowfall forces birds suddenly from one food type to another.
Many bird species cushion the effects of food shortage by storage, either of body fat or
food itself. In small birds, fat stores are accumulated mainly for use overnight, and few
species can last more than a day or two without feeding. Larger birds, with their relatively
lower metabolic (energy) demands, can store relatively more energy per unit of body
weight. As a result, larger birds can rely on internal reserves for longer than small ones,
more than two weeks in large waterfowl. Many birds store some body fat and protein in
preparation for breeding, extreme examples being Arctic-nesting geese, in which the
females produce and incubate their eggs almost entirely on reserves accumulated in
wintering or migration areas. For some weeks, then, they are protected against the need
to feed on their breeding grounds. Most migratory birds accumulate body fat for the
journey, the amount depending on the duration of the unbroken flight.
Species that store food items outside the body may retrieve them hours, days, or even
months later, depending partly on the type of food. Some meat eaters cache (store) prey
for consumption later in the day or in the following days, while some seed eaters may
store food in autumn to last through the winter or even year-round. Long-term storage is
frequent among various birds, such as tits, nuthatches, and woodpeckers, reaching its
extreme in certain jays and nutcrackers. In some such species, stored food can provide
more than 80 percent of the winter diet, and can also feed the adults into the next breeding
season, influencing the numbers of young raised. In good seed years, huge amounts of
seed can be stored. Crucial aspects of hoarding behavior are that individuals should
guard their stores or should hide them (to reduce theft) and remember where they are.
Some species store items individually, each in a separate place, and in experiments, have
shown incredible feats of memory. But none of this behavior alters the dependence of
such birds on their food supplies; it simply enables them to use their foods more
Page 265 of 269
effectively, taking advantage of temporary gluts (oversupply) to lessen later shortages. It
does not prevent them from being limited by shortages in years of poor seed crops.
Yet other birds can cushion themselves against temporary food shortages by becoming
torpid, meaning they achieve an inactive state in which body temperature and heart,
respiratory, and metabolic rates are greatly depressed, thereby conserving energy. In
some small species, this happens to some degree every night, but it is especially marked
in some small hummingbirds, such as Anna's hummingbird of western North America.
Some other species, such as the common swift, can remain torpid for several days at a
time when cold weather renders their insect prey inactive, and at least one species, the
common poorwill, can remain torpid for several weeks, in a state akin to hibernation in
mammals. These adaptations help the species concerned to last through difficult periods,
whether hours, days, or weeks, but they cannot eliminate altogether the risk of starvation.

66.1: Cotton Ginning and Interchangeable Parts: The Legacy of Eli Whitney
Cotton is a soft fiber that grows around the seeds of the cotton plant. It was first cultivated
in the Indus Valley about 6,000 years ago and then spread to Egypt, Persia, China, and
the Mediterranean. For thousands of years, the cultivation of cotton was very laborintensive. Many steps were involved in preparing cotton to be used in a garment, and
many machines were invented to make cotton more valuable as a general-purpose textile
material.
The process of separating cotton fibers from seeds is called ginning, which is depicted as
far back as the fifth century in paintings in the Ajanta Caves in India. Egyptian cotton has
the longest fibers and is used to make premium fabrics. In the American South, the highquality long-staple cotton can be grown only in a narrow band along the Carolina and
Georgia coast and is called Sea Island cotton. The interior areas of the American South
can only grow Upland short-staple cotton. The shorter-length fibers mean reduced yarn
and cloth quality, and they have "fuzzy" seeds because the fibers are tightly attached to
the entire seed surface. This strong attachment of fibers to seeds makes it difficult to
remove the fibers without damage, which made the process expensive as it was timeconsuming and labor-intensive. These time-consuming tasks were done by slaves in the
American southern states during the 1800s.
The modern cotton gin was invented by the American Eli Whitney (1765-1825), who
graduated from Yale University in 1789 and is known for two great inventions: the cotton
gin, which transformed the southern economy, and interchangeable parts in machinery,
which led to the mass-production method of manufacturing. When he graduated, he was
short of funds and went to Georgia to seek his fortune in plantations. He was introduced
to the problem of finding a better way to gin the Upland short-fiber cotton, which led him
to invent the cotton gin in 1794. Whitney's cotton gin made the mechanical separation of
fiber from seeds much more efficient. His machine had spiked sawteeth mounted on a
revolving cylinder in a box, which was turned by a crank. The teeth pulled the cotton fiber
through small slotted openings that were too small for the seeds to pass; thus, the lint
was separated from the seeds. Then, a rotating brush removed the fibrous lint from the
teeth, and the seeds fell into a hopper. Whitney's machine could separate up to 50 pounds
of cleaned cotton daily, making cotton production profitable for the southern states.
Unfortunately for Whitney, his cotton gin was extremely simple and easy to copy, so he
failed to profit from his invention. Soon after, imitations of his machine appeared, and his
1794 patent for the cotton gin could not be upheld in court until 1807. Instead, he decided
to make money by going into the ginning business, and manufacturing and installing
cotton gins throughout Georgia and the southern states. However, his ginning plants were
resented by the planters, who thought that he charged too much, and hence, found ways
to circumvent his patent.
In later years, Eli Whitney cultivated social and political connections through his status as
Page 267 of 269
a Yale alumnus and through his marriage. Although he had never made a gun in his life,
through those connections, he won a contract from the War Department in 1798 to make
and deliver 10,000 muskets (firearms used by soldiers before the invention of the rifle) for
the army in 1800. Treasury Secretary Wolcott sent him a "foreign pamphlet" on arms
manufacturing techniques, and Whitney began to talk about interchangeable parts. This
concept was a departure from the usual method of having an individual master machinist
make each part of the musket and fit them together, which is slow and painstaking.
Whitney's method was to have many less-skilled machinists specialize in making only
one part per person to highly specified dimensions, so that the parts would be
interchangeable and could then be assembled. This is the heart of the mass-production
method, later made more famous by Henry Ford in the manufacture of the Model T
automobile. Whitney ultimately delivered on the army contract in 1809, and he spent the
rest of his life promoting interchangeability.

66.2: Interpreting Prehistoric Cave Art
The Upper Paleolithic period began about 45,000 B.C. It is from this period, in several
caves located in Europe, that archaeologists have discovered remarkable examples of
prehistoric art. One of the early interpretations of cave art was that it was “art for the sake
of art," much as we today might go to a museum to see the skills of artists. This is a
Western-culture-centered interpretation, however, and some would argue that there might
be other, context-specific interpretations that are more suitable. The location of this art
deep within dark caves, in which small flickering lamps would only reveal small portions
of painted walls, also does not seem to fit with an interpretation of prehistoric “art
galleries."
Another early interpretation was based on the fact that most of the images are animals,
and the majority of these, such as horses and bison, were hunted for food. This viewpoint
became known as the "hunting magic" explanation. The drawing of the animals was
interpreted as a way to magically ensure that an upcoming hunt would be successful. The
hunting-magic interpretation has much appeal because we know that hunting was an
important part of daily life during this period. And, in direct contrast to the art-for-art's-sake
explanation, the practice of these “rituals" deep within caves suggests that not everyone
participated. There are many nonhunting images in the caves, however, that do not
support this explanation, such as geometric shapes and human figures.
In an effort to include all the types of images in Upper Paleolithic cave art in a
comprehensive interpretation, some researchers turned to aspects of how the human
mind works during altered states of consciousness and what images the mind “sees"
during different phases of altered states. This explanation is called “entoptic phenomena,"
and it argues that all modern human brains experience the same sets of visual images in
the same progression. For example, during the first stage, it is common to see geometric
patterns; during the second stage, the brain begins to associate various geometric
designs with real objects; and during the third stage, the brain sees actual animals,
people, and monsters. Altered states can be achieved in many ways-drugs, intense
dancing, sitting in absolute darkness as in a deep cave-and the entoptic phenomena
interpretation argues that cave-art images represent the "visions" seen during these
experiences.
Other explanations focus more on the use of cave art as a form of communication. That
is, its presence and the types of images were used to establish social identities and
perhaps as territorial markers. Communication, as an explanation, is based on identifying
different styles that represent different groups of people and is a key element at
aggregation sites, places where these people came together at certain times.
Communication also is seen as adaptive because it enhances the survival of groups using
social networks or alliances. The abundance of cave art in France and Spain, particularly
during the Late Upper Paleolithic, is thought to be one outcome of the dense packing of
people as they moved south to escape the harshest conditions of the extreme cold of the
Page 269 of 269
glacial maximum of the last ice age. Art was used to form alliances and thus resolve
disputes about resources between groups who could not easily move away because of
the close presence of many groups and the inhospitable nature of more northern areas
in Europe.
In recent years, accumulating evidence suggests that Upper Paleolithic people created
wall art not only in relatively inaccessible caves, but also in the rock shelters where they
lived. Like Later Stone Age rock shelters in Africa, those of the Upper Paleolithic in Europe
were exposed to sun, rain, and other weather, and most of the art present in these locales
has long since disappeared. The traces we do have, however, suggest that wall art was
a much more common feature of daily life than the art present deep in caves might
suggest. And, if wall art was much more widespread and was typical of people's living
sites, then single-cause explanations for wall art, especially those that are based, in part,
on its inaccessibility in deep caves, seem less likely to be accurate models for all Upper
Paleolithic wall art.

Conversation 1
Narrator
Listen to part of a conversation between a student and a librarian.
Student
Hi, um…, I really hope you can help me.
Librarian
That’s why I’m here. What can I do for you?
Student
I’m supposed to do a literature review for my psychology course, but I’m… having a hard time finding articles. I don’t
even know where to start looking.
Librarian
You said this is for your psychology course, right? So your focus is on …
Student
Dream Interpretation.
7Librarian
Well, you have a focus, so that’s already a good start. Hmmm… well, there’re a few things… oh wait… have you
checked to see if your professor put any material for you to look at on reserve?
Student
Aha, that’s one thing I did know to do. I just copied an article, but I still need three more on my topic from three
different journals.
Librarian
Let’s get you going on looking for those then. We have printed versions of twenty or so psychology journals in the
Reference Section. These are ones published within the last year. Now that I think about it… there’s a journal named Sleep
and Dreams.
Student
Oh, yeah, the article I just copied is from that journal, so I’ve got to look in other sources.
Librarian
Ok, actually, most of our materials are available electronically now. You can access psychology databases or electronic
journals and articles through the library’s computers, and if you want to search by title with the word ‘dream’ for example,
just type it in and all the articles with ‘dream’ in the title will come up on the screen.
Student
Cool, that’s great! Too bad I cannot do this from home.
Librarian
But you can. All of the library’s databases and electronic sources can be accessed through any computer connected to
the university network.
Student
Really?! I can’t believe I didn’t know that. It still sounds like it’s going to take a while though, you know, going
through all of that information, all of those sources.
Librarian
Maybe, but you already narrowed your search down to articles on Dream Interpretation, so it shouldn’t be too bad. And
you probably notice that there’s an abstract or summary at the top of the first page of the article you copied. When you go
into the databases and electronic sources, you have the option to display the abstracts on the computer screen, skimming
those to decide whether or not you want to read the whole article should cut down some time.
Student
Right, abstracts! They’ll definitely make the project more doable. I guess I should try out the electronic search while
I’m still here then, you know, just in case.
Librarian
Sure, er… that computer’s free over there, and I’ll be here till five this afternoon.
Student
Thanks, I feel a lot better about this assignment now.
8TPO 1 Lecture 1 Contemporary art
Listen to part of a lecture in a contemporary art class.
Professor
Ok, I’m going to begin this lecture by giving you your next assignment. Remember I said that at some point during this
semester I wanted you to attend an exhibit at the Fairy Street Gallery and then write about it? Well, the exhibit that I want
you to attend is coming up. It’s already started in fact, but it’ll be at the gallery for the next month, which should give you
plenty of time to complete this assignment.
The name of the artist exhibiting there is Rose Frantzen. Frantzen’s work may be unfamiliar to you since she’s a
relatively young artist. But she’s got a very unusual style, compared to some of the artists we’ve looked at this term. But
anyway, Frantzen’s style is what she herself calls Realistic Impressionism. So you’ve probably studied both of these
movements separately, separate movements, Realism and Impressionism, in some of your art history courses. So who can
just sum these up?
Student
Well, Impressionism started in the late 19th century. Um…the basic impressionist style was very different from earlier
styles. It didn’t depict scenes or models exactly as they looked. Um… Impressionist painters tended to apply paint really
thickly, and in big brushstrokes, so the texture of the canvas was rough.
Professor
Good. What else? What were the subjects?
Student
Well, a lot of impressionist artists painted everyday scenes, like people on the streets and in cafes, uh, lots of nature
scenes, especially landscapes.
Professor
Good. So when you go to the exhibit, I really want you to take a close look at a certain painting. It’s a farm scene. And
you will see it right as you enter the gallery. The reason I think this painting is so important is that it stresses the
impressionist aspect of Frantzen’s style. It’s an outdoor scene, an everyday scene. It’s kind of bleak, but you can really see
those broad brushstrokes and the blurry lines. The colors aren’t quite realistic. The sky is kind of, well an unnatural pinkish
yellow. And the fence in the foreground is blue, but somehow the overall scene gives an impression of a cold, bleak winter
day on a farm. So that’s the impressionist side of her work. Oh, and speaking about farms, that reminds me. One interesting thing I read about Franzten is that when she first
moved back to Iowa after living abroad, she often visited this place in her town called the Sales Barn. And the Sales Barn, it
was basically this place where the local farmers bought and sold their cattle, their farm animals. And the reason Frantzen
went there, and she later on would visit other places like dance halls, was to observe people and the ways that they moved.
She really found that this helped her work---that it gave her an understanding of body movements and actions, how humans
move, and stand still, what their postures were like, too.
So, what about Realism? What are the elements of Realism we should be looking for in Frantzen’s work?
Student
Um… real honest depictions of subject matter, pretty unidealized stuff, and pretty everyday subject matter, too.
9Professor
Good. One other painting I really want you to look at is of a young woman surrounded by pumpkins. You will notice
that the woman’s face is so realistic looking that it’s almost like a photograph. The woman’s nose is a little less than perfect
and her hair is kind of messed up. This is realism. But then, the background of the painting, this woman with the pumpkins
is wrapped in a blanket of broad thick brushstrokes, and, it’s all kinds of zigzagging brushstrokes and lines, kind of chaotic
almost when you look at it close. And there are vibrant colors. There’s lots of orange, with little hints of an electric blue
peeking out.
I find Frantzen to be a very accessible artist. I mean, some artists, to appreciate them, you have to know their life story.
But here’s a little bit about Rose Frantzen’s life anyway. She attended art school, but was told by one of her instructors that
she was not good at illustration, that she should go into advertising instead. So she took advertising classes and fine arts
classes too, until she was convinced by the head of an advertising agency that her work was really good, that she could be
an artist. But of course, it’s not as easy as that, and so Frantzen had to paint other people’s portraits at places like art fairs
just to make money to buy paint for her more serious art work. No matter what, she never stopped painting. And now,
Frantzen is doing extremely well. And her work is being shown all over the country. So I think most of us would be
discouraged if we had to face challenges and difficulties like that. But what’s important is that you keep at it that you don’t
give up. That’s what is really important to remember.
TPO 1 Lecture2 Geology
Listen to part of a lecture in a geology class.
Professor
Ok, let’s get started. Great. Today I want to talk about a way in which we are able to determine how old a piece of land,
or some other geologic feature is - dating techniques. I’m going to talk about a particular dating technique. Why? Good
dating is key to good analysis. In other words, if you want to know how a land formation was formed, the first thing you
probably want to know is how old it is. It’s fundamental.
Uh… Take the Grand Canyon for instance. Now, we geologists thought we had a pretty good idea of how the Grand
Canyon in the southwestern United States was formed. We knew that it was formed from sandstone that solidified
somewhere between 150 and 300 million years ago. Before it solidified, it was just regular sand. Essentially it was part of a
vast desert. And until just recently, most of us thought the sand had come from an ancient mountain range fairly close by
that flattened out over time. That’s been the conventional wisdom among geologists for quite some time.
But now we’ve learned something different, and quite surprising, using a technique called Uranium-Lead Dating. I
should say that Uranium-Lead Dating has been around for quite a while. But there have been some recent refinements. I will
get into this in a minute. Anyway, Uranium-Lead Dating has produced some surprises. Two geologists discovered that about
half of the sand from the Grand Canyon was actually once part of the Appalachian Mountains. That’s really eye-opening
news, since the Appalachian Mountain Range is, of course, thousands of kilometers to the east of the Grand Canyon.
Sounds pretty unbelievable, right? Of course, the obvious question is how did that sand end up so far west? The theory is
that huge rivers and wind carried the sand west where it mixed in with the sand that was already there.
Well, this was a pretty revolutionary finding. Um… and it was basically because of Uranium-Lead Dating. Why? Well,
as everyone in this class should know, we usually look at the grain type within sandstone, meaning the actual particles in the
sandstone, to determine where it came from. You can do other things too, like look at the wind or water that brought the
grains to their location and figure out which way it was flowing. But that’s only useful up to a point, and that’s not what
these two geologists did.
10Uranium-Lead Dating allowed them to go about it in an entirely different way. What they did was: they looked at the
grains of Zircon in the sandstone. Zircon is a material that contains radioactive Uranium, which makes it very useful for
dating purposes. Zircon starts off as molten magma, the hot lava from volcanoes. This magma then crystallizes. And when
Zircon crystallizes, the Uranium inside it begins to change into Lead. So if you measure the amount of Lead in the Zircon
grain, you can figure out when the grain was formed. After that, you can determine the age of Zircon from different
mountain ranges. Once you do that, you can compare the age of the Zircon in the sandstone in your sample to the age of the
Zircon in the mountains. If the age of the Zircon matches the age of one of the mountain ranges, then it means the sandstone
actually used to be part of that particular mountain range. Is everybody with me on that? Good. So, in this case,
Uranium-Lead Dating was used to establish that half of the sandstone in the samples was formed at the same time the
granite in the Appalachian Mountains was formed. So because of this, this new way of doing Uranium-Lead Dating, we’ve
been able to determine that one of our major assumptions about the Grand Canyon was wrong.
Like I said before, Uranium-Lead Dating has been with us for a while. But, um… until recently, in order to do it, you
really had to study many individual grains. And it took a long time before you got results. It just wasn’t very efficient. And
it wasn’t very accurate. But technical advances have cut down on the number of grains you have to study, so you get your
results faster. So I’ll predict that Uranium-Lead Dating is going to become an increasingly popular dating method.
There are a few pretty exciting possibilities for Uranium-Lead Dating. Here is one that comes to mind. You know the
theory that earth’s continents were once joined together and only split apart relatively recently? Well, with Uranium-Lead
Dating, we could prove that more conclusively. If they show evidence of once having been joined, that could really tell us a
lot about the early history of the planet’s geology.
TPO 1 Conversation 2
Narrator
Listen to part of a conversation between a student and his professor.
Professor
Hi Mathew, I’m glad you could come in today. You’ve been observing Mr. Grable’s third-grade class for your
approaches to education paper, right?
Student
Um, yes. I go over to Johnson Elementary School, you know, to watch Mr. Grable teach the children in class. It’s been
amazing, I mean, I’m just learning so much from just watching him. I’m so glad the classroom observations are a
requirement for the education program. I mean it’s like the best thing ever to prepare you to be a good teacher.
Professor
Well, I’m glad to see you feel that way, Mathew. You know, that’s the goal. So, I’ve been reading over your observation
notes and I’m quite interested in what’s going on, in particular with the astronomy unit he’s been teaching.
Student
The astronomy unit?
Professor
It seems that Mr. Grable has mastered the interdisciplinary approach to teaching that we’ve been talking about in class.
11Student
Oh! OK, yeah, so like when he was teaching them astronomy, he didn't just teach them the names of the planets, he
used it as a way to teach mythology.
Professor
Really! So, how did he do that?
Student
Well, some of the students could already name the planets, but they didn’t know that the names had any meaning —the stories behind them.
Professor
So, he…
Student
He introduced Greek and Roman mythology as a way of explaining. Like, you know, how like Jupiter’s the biggest
planet, right, and how Jupiter was the name of the king of the gods in Roman mythology, right? So since Jupiter, the planet,
is the largest planet in our solar system, it’s like the king of the planets, like Jupiter was the king of all the gods.
Professor
Oh, Mathew, that’s a great example.
Student
Yeah! And each student chose a planet and then did research on it to write a report and make a presentation. They went
to the library to do the research, then they made presentations about the planet they chose.
Professor
So, in one science unit, in which the focus was astronomy, the students also learned about the literature of Greek and
Roman mythology, used research skills in the library, wrote a report and practiced their oral presentation skills.
Student
Exactly! He used this one topic to teach third-graders all that stuff — how to use the books in the library, to write
reports, and even how to speak in public. Plus they had a great time doing it.
Professor
You know, Mathew, this is just what we’ve been talking about in our class. I’m sure everyone can learn something
from your experience. You know, Mathew, I’d love for you to talk about this astronomy unit in class on Wednesday.
Student
Really?! Um… ‘cause I don’t really think I’ll have any time to write my paper by then.
Professor
Oh, you won’t need to write anything new just yet. For Wednesday, use your class observation notes and explain the
things we’ve discussed today.
Student
Ok, that sounds all right.
12TPO 1 Lecture 3 Archeology
Listen to part of a lecture in an archeology class.
Professor
OK, we’ve been talking about early agriculture in the near east. So let’s concentrate on one site and see what we can
learn from it. Let’s look at Catalhoyuk. Um… I’d better write that down. Catalhoyuk, that’s about as close as we get in
English. It’s Turkish, really. The site’s in modern day Turkey, and who knows what the original inhabitants called it.
Anyway, uh…Catalhoyuk wasn’t the first agricultural settlement in the near east, but it was pretty early, settled about 9,000
years ago in the Neolithic period. And ... um... the settlement...uh...town really, lasted about a thousand years and grew to a
size of about eight or ten thousand people. That certainly makes it one of the largest towns in the world at that time.
One of the things that make the settlement of this size impressive is the time period. It’s the Neolithic, remember, the
late Stone Age. So the people that lived there had only stone tools, no metals. So everything they accomplished, like
building this town, they did with just stone, plus wood, bricks, that sort of thing. But you got to remember that it wasn’t just
any stone they had, they had obsidian. And um... obsidian is a black, volcanic, well, almost like glass. It flakes very nicely
into really sharp points. The sharpest tools of the entire Stone Age were made of obsidian. And uh... the people of
Catalhoyuk got theirs from further inland, from central Turkey, traded for it, probably.
Anyway, what I wanna focus on is the way the town was built. The houses are all rectangular, one storey, made of
sun-dried bricks. But what’s really interesting is that there are no spaces between them, no streets in other words, and so
generally no doors on the houses either. People walked around on the roofs and entered the house through a hatchway on the
roof, down a wooden ladder. You can still see the diagonal marks of the ladders in the plaster on the inside walls. Once you
were in the house, there would be one main room and a couple of small rooms for storage. The main room had the hearths,
for cooking and for heat. It would’ve been pretty cold during the winters. And it also looks like they made their tools near
the fire. There tends to be a lot of obsidian flakes and chips in the hearth ashes, but no chimney. The smoke just went out the
same hatchway that people used for going in and out themselves. So there would have been an open fire inside the house
with only one hole in the roof to let the smoke out. You and I would have found it a bit too smoky in there. You can see on
the walls, which they plastered and decorated with paintings. They ended up with a layer of black soot on them, and so did
people’s lungs. The bones found in the graves show a layer of soot on the inside of the ribs.
And that’s another unusual feature of Catalhoyuk, the burial sites. The graves have all been found under the houses,
right under the floors. And it maybe this burial custom that explains why the houses were packed in so tightly without
streets. I mean, you might think it was for protection or something, but there has been no evidence found yet of any violent
attack that would indicate that kind of danger. It maybe they wanted to live as near as possible to their ancestors’ graves and
be buried near them themselves. But it makes a good point. Based on excavations, we can know the layout of the houses
and the location of the graves, but we’re only guessing when we tried to say why they did it that way. That’s the way it is
with archeology. You are dealing with the physical remains that people left behind. We have no sure access to what they
thought and how they felt about things. I mean it’s interesting to speculate. And the physical artifacts can give us clues, but
there is a lot we can’t really know. So, for instance, their art. They painted on the plastered walls and usually they painted
hunting scenes with wild animals in them. Now they did hunt and they also raised cereal crops and kept sheep, but we don’t
know why so many of the paintings are of hunting scenes. Was it supposed to have religious or magical significance? That’s
the kind of thing we can only guess at based on clues. And hopefully, further excavation of Catalhoyuk will yield more
clues. But we’ll probably never know for sure.
13TPO 1 Lecture 4 Biology
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a biology class.
Professor
For today’s discussion, we’ll review the case study on how some animals have behaviorally adapted to their
environments. Now you had to read about two animal species, the Eastern marmot and the Olympic marmot. Marmots are
rodents. They are large ground squirrels, about the size of an average house cat. And they live in a variety of habitats. And
even though they spend the significant portion of the year hibernating, according to this case study, marmots are still
considered excellent subjects for animal behavioral studies. Why is that?
Student
Well, when they are not hibernating, you can find them in open areas. And they are pretty active during the day, which
makes them easy to observe, right?
Professor
Uh-huh, so first let’s discuss the Eastern marmots. They reside throughout the eastern region of North America where
there is a temperate climate, where the growing season lasts for at least five months of the year, which is when they do all
their mating, playing and eating.
Student
Oh, I see. At first I wasn’t sure what growing season meant, just from the reading. But now I get it. It's the amount of
time it takes for them to grow, right? So it would be five months?
Professor
Umm? Oh, uh… I’m sorry but no. It has nothing to do with that. It's not about the time it takes for Eastern marmots to
grow. It’s when the food is available. That is when it’s not covered in snow and there is no frost covering the grass and,
umm, vegetative parts of a plant’s herbs and the flowers the marmots like to eat. So growing season refers to the availability
of the food they eat, OK? So now how would you describe the Eastern marmots’ social habits?
Student
Well, they are really territorial, and loners, and just so aggressive even with other Eastern marmots. And their mating
ritual is just so impersonal.
Professor
Uh-huh? Now when they emerge in the spring from hibernation, the mating process begins. For them, well, they come
together to mate and then they go their separate ways. Then about six to eight weeks after birth, the offspring leave their
mothers.
Student
Really? Just six weeks? Is that possible for the offspring to make it on their own so young?
Professor
Well, it’s not as if they aren’t ready for the real world because they are. Remember, they mature quickly and the
weather’s nice. Also they live in open fields where there is lots of edible vegetation. So roughly six weeks after birth,
Eastern marmots are just old enough to take their chances of surviving in the temperate environment. So how does this
14relate to their behavior?
Student
Oh, I get it. Since the climate’s not too bad, the Eastern marmots don't have to rely on each other too much and they
really don't need to stay together as a family to survive either.
Professor
Uh-ha. Any contrast, the Olympic marmots? What about them?
Student
Well, they live together as a family and take care of their young until they are at least two years old. They’re really
friendly with each other. And what I really like is that they even have greeting ceremonies. And they are not at all aggressive
and territorial like the Eastern marmots. So their social behavior is so different from Eastern marmots because of the climate
where they live? That seems so bizarre.
Professor
Well, the Olympic marmots inhabit meadows high in the Olympic Mountains where the weather conditions are much
harsher. So there is a lot more wind and snow. The growing season only lasts about two to three months. So in that much
shorter period of time, all the Olympic marmots, male and female, eat, play, work and nurture the young together. Because
the climate is so harsh, cooperation increases the survival rate of the Olympic marmots. They keep their young at home until
they are physically able to survive on their own. This could explain why the social behavior of the Olympic marmots is so
unlike that of the Eastern marmots.

Conversation 1
Narrator
Listen to a conversation between a student and a professor.
Student
Uh, excuse me, Professor Thompson. I know your office hours are tomorrow, but I was wondering if you had a few
minutes free now to discuss something.
Professor
Sure, John. What did you want to talk about?
Student
Well, I have some quick questions about how to write up the research project I did this semester—about climate
variations.
Professor
Oh, yes. You were looking at variations in climate in the Grant City area, right? How far along have you gotten?
Student
I’ve got all my data, so I’m starting to summarize it now, preparing graphs and stuff. But I’m just. . . I’m looking at it
and I’m afraid that it’s not enough, but I’m not sure what else to put in the report.
15Professor
I hear the same thing from every student. You know, you have to remember now that you’re the expert on what you’ve
done. So, think about what you’d need to include if you were going to explain your research project to someone with
general or casual knowledge about the subject, like . . . like your parents. That’s usually my rule of thumb: would my
parents understand this?
Student
OK. I get it.
Professor
I hope you can recognize by my saying that how much you do know about the subject.
Student
Right. I understand. I was wondering if I should also include the notes from the research journal
you suggested I keep.
Professor
Yes, definitely. You should use them to indicate what your evolution in thought was through time. So, just set up, you
know, what was the purpose of what you were doing—to try to understand the climate variability of this area—and what
you did, and what your approach was.
Student
OK. So, for example, I studied meteorological records; I looked at climate charts; I used different methods for
analyzing the data, like certain statistical tests; and then I discuss the results. Is that what you mean?
Professor
Yes, that’s right. You should include all of that. The statistical tests are especially important. And also be sure you
include a good reference section where all your published and unpublished data came from, ‘cause you have a lot of
unpublished climate data.
Student
Hmm . . . something just came into my mind and went out the other side.
Professor
That happens to me a lot, so I’ve come up with a pretty good memory management tool. I carry a little pad with me all
the time and jot down questions or ideas that I don’t want to forget. For example, I went to the doctor with my daughter and
her baby son last week and we knew we wouldn’t remember everything we wanted to ask the doctor, so we actually made a
list of five things we wanted answers to.
Student
A notepad is a good idea. Since I’m so busy now at the end of the semester, I’m getting pretty forgetful these days. OK.
I just remembered what I was trying to say before.
Professor
Good. I was hoping you’d come up with it.
Student
Yes. It ends up that I have data on more than just the immediate Grant City area, so I also included some regional data
16in the report. With everything else it should be a pretty good indicator of the climate in this part of the state.
Professor
Sounds good. I’d be happy to look over a draft version before you hand in the final copy, if you wish.
Student
Great. I’ll plan to get you a draft of the paper by next Friday. Thanks very much. Well, see ya.
Professor
OK.
TPO2 Lecture 1 Psychology
Narrator
Listen to part of a psychology lecture. The professor is discussing behaviorism.
Professor
Now, many people consider John Watson to be the founder of behaviorism. And like other behaviorists, he believed
that psychologists should study only the behaviors they can observe and measure. They’re not interested in mental processes.
While a person could describe his thoughts, no one else can see or hear them to verify the accuracy of his report. But one
thing you can observe is muscular habits. What Watson did was to observe muscular habits because he viewed them as a
manifestation of thinking. One kind of habits that he studied are laryngeal habits.
Watson thought laryngeal habits . . . you know, from larynx, in other words, related to the voice box . . . he thought
those habits were an expression of thinking. He argued that for very young children, thinking is really talking out loud to
oneself because they talk out loud even if they’re not trying to communicate with someone in particular. As the individual
matures, that overt talking to oneself becomes covert talking to oneself, but thinking still shows up as a laryngeal habit. One
of the bits of evidence that supports this is that when people are trying to solve a problem, they, um, typically have
increased muscular activity in the throat region. That is, if you put electrodes on the throat and measure muscle
potential—muscle activity—you discover that when people are thinking, like if they’re diligently trying to solve a problem,
that there is muscular activity in the throat region.
So, Watson made the argument that problem solving, or thinking, can be defined as a set of behaviors—a set of
responses—and in this case the response he observed was the throat activity. That’s what he means when he calls it a
laryngeal habit. Now, as I am thinking about what I am going to be saying, my muscles in my throat are responding. So,
thinking can be measured as muscle activity. Now, the motor theory . . . yes?
Student
Professor Blake, um, did he happen to look at people who sign? I mean deaf people?
Professor
Uh, he did indeed, um, and to jump ahead, what one finds in deaf individuals who use sign language when they’re
given problems of various kinds, they have muscular changes in their hands when they are trying to solve a problem . . .
muscle changes in the hand, just like the muscular changes going on in the throat region for speaking individuals.
So, for Watson, thinking is identical with the activity of muscles. A related concept of thinking was developed by
William James. It’s called ideomotor action.
17Ideomotor action is an activity that occurs without our noticing it, without our being aware of it. I’ll give you one
simple example. If you think of locations, there tends to be eye movement that occurs with your thinking about that location.
In particular, from where we’re sitting, imagine that you’re asked to think of our university library. Well, if you close your
eyes and think of the library, and if you’re sitting directly facing me, then according to this notion, your eyeballs will move
slightly to the left, to your left, ‘cause the library’s in that general direction.
James and others said that this is an idea leading to a motor action, and that’s why it’s called “ideomotor action”—an
idea leads to motor activity. If you wish to impress your friends and relatives, you can change this simple process into a
magic trick. Ask people to do something such as I’ve just described: think of something on their left; think of something on
their right. You get them to think about two things on either side with their eyes closed, and you watch their eyes very
carefully. And if you do that, you’ll discover that you can see rather clearly the eye movement—that is, you can see the
movement of the eyeballs. Now, then you say, think of either one and I’ll tell which you’re thinking of.
OK. Well, Watson makes the assumption that muscular activity is equivalent to thinking. But given everything we’ve
been talking about here, one has to ask: are there alternatives to this motor theory—this claim that muscular activities are
equivalent to thinking? Is there anything else that might account for this change in muscular activity, other than saying that
it is thinking? And the answer is clearly yes. Is there any way to answer the question definitively? I think the answer is no.
TPO2 Lecture 2 Botany
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture from a Botany class.
Professor
Hi, everyone. Good to see you all today. Actually, I expected the population to be a lot lower today. It typically runs
between 50 and 60 percent on the day the research paper is due. Um, I was hoping to have your exams back today, but, uh,
the situation was that I went away for the weekend, and I was supposed to get in yesterday at five, and I expected to fully
complete all the exams by midnight or so, which is the time that I usually go to bed, but my flight was delayed, and I ended
up not getting in until one o’clock in the morning. Anyway, I’ll do my best to have them finished by the next time we meet.
OK. In the last class, we started talking about useful plant fibers. In particular, we talked about cotton fibers, which we
said were very useful, not only in the textile industry, but also in the chemical industry, and in the production of many
products, such as plastics, paper, explosives, and so on. Today we’ll continue talking about useful fibers, and we’ll begin
with a fiber that’s commonly known as “Manila hemp.”
Now, for some strange reason, many people believe that Manila hemp is a hemp plant. But Manila hemp is not really
hemp. It’s actually a member of the banana family— it even bears little banana-shaped fruits. The “Manila” part of the
name makes sense, because Manila hemp is produced chiefly in the Philippine Islands and, of course, the capital city of the
Philippines is Manila.
Now, as fibers go, Manila hemp fibers are very long. They can easily be several feet in length and they’re also very
strong, very flexible. They have one more characteristic that’s very important, and that is that they are exceptionally
resistant to salt water. And this combination of characteristics—long, strong, flexible, resistant to salt water—makes Manila
hemp a great material for ropes, especially for ropes that are gonna be used on ocean-going ships. In fact, by the early
1940’s, even though steel cables were available, most ships in the United States Navy were not moored with steel cables;
they were moored with Manila hemp ropes.
18Now, why was that? Well, the main reason was that steel cables degrade very, very quickly in contact with salt water. If
you’ve ever been to San Francisco, you know that the Golden Gate Bridge is red. And it’s red because of the zinc paint that
goes on those stainless steel cables. That, if they start at one end of the bridge and they work to the other end, by the time
they finish, it’s already time to go back and start painting the beginning of the bridge again, because the bridge was built
with steel cables, and steel cables can’t take the salt air unless they’re treated repeatedly with a zinc-based paint.
On the other hand, plant products like Manila hemp, you can drag through the ocean for weeks on end. If you wanna
tie your anchor to it and drop it right into the ocean, that’s no problem, because plant fibers can stand up for months, even
years, in direct contact with salt water. OK. So how do you take plant fibers that individually you could break with your
hands and turn them into a rope that’s strong enough to moor a ship that weighs thousands of tons? Well, what you do is you
extract these long fibers from the Manila hemp plant, and then you take several of these fibers, and you group them into a
bundle, because by grouping the fibers you greatly increase their breaking strength—that bundle of fibers is much stronger
than any of the individual fibers that compose it. And then you take that bundle of fibers and you twist it a little bit, because
by twisting it, you increase its breaking strength even more. And then you take several of these little bundles, and you group
and twist them into bigger bundles, which you then group and twist into even bigger bundles, and so on, until eventually,
you end up with a very, very strong rope.

TPO2 Lecture 3 Philosophy
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a philosophy class.
Professor
OK. Another ancient Greek philosopher we need to discuss is Aristotle—Aristotle’s ethical theory. What Aristotle’s
ethical theory is all about is this: he’s trying to show you how to be happy—what true happiness is.
Now, why is he interested in human happiness? It’s not just because it’s something that all people want to aim for. It’s
more than that. But to get there we need to first make a very important distinction. Let me introduce a couple of technical
terms: extrinsic value and intrinsic value.
To understand Aristotle’s interest in happiness, you need to understand this distinction.
Some things we aim for and value, not for themselves but for what they bring about in addition to themselves. If I
value something as a means to something else, then it has what we will call “extrinsic value.” Other things we desire and
hold to be valuable for themselves alone. If we value something not as a means to something else, but for its own sake, let
us say that it has “intrinsic value.”
Exercise. There may be some people who value exercise for itself, but I don’t. I value exercise because if I exercise, I
tend to stay healthier than I would if I didn’t. So I desire to engage in exercise and I value exercise extrinsically . . . not for
its own sake, but as a means to something beyond it. It brings me good health.
Health. Why do I value good health? Well, here it gets a little more complicated for me. Um, health is important for me
because I can’t . . .do other things I want to do— play music, teach philosophy—if I’m ill. So health is important to
me—has value to me—as a means to a productive life. But health is also important to me because I just kind of like to be
healthy—it feels good. It’s pleasant to be healthy, unpleasant not to be. So to some degree I value health both for itself and
as a means to something else: productivity. It’s got extrinsic and intrinsic value for me.
Then there’s some things that are just valued for themselves. I’m a musician, not a professional musician; I just play a
musical instrument for fun. Why do I value playing music? Well, like most amateur musicians, I only play because, well, I
just enjoy it. It’s something that’s an end in itself.
Now, something else I value is teaching. Why? Well, it brings in a modest income, but I could make more money doing
21other things. I’d do it even if they didn’t pay me. I just enjoy teaching. In that sense it’s an end to itself.
But teaching’s not something that has intrinsic value for all people—and that’s true generally. Most things that are
enjoyed in and of themselves vary from person to person. Some people value teaching intrinsically, but others don’t.
So how does all this relate to human happiness? Well, Aristotle asks: is there something that all human beings value . . .
and value only intrinsically, for its own sake and only for its own sake? If you could find such a thing, that would be the
universal final good, or truly the ultimate purpose or goal for all human beings. Aristotle thought the answer was yes. What
is it? Happiness. Everyone will agree, he argues, that happiness is the ultimate end to be valued for itself and really only for
itself. For what other purpose is there in being happy? What does it yield? The attainment of happiness becomes the
ultimate or highest good for Aristotle.
The next question that Aristotle raises is: what is happiness? We all want it; we all desire it; we all seek it. It’s the goal
we have in life. But what is it? How do we find it? Here he notes, with some frustration, people disagree.
But he does give us a couple of criteria, or features, to keep in mind as we look for what true human happiness is. True
human happiness should be, as he puts it, complete. Complete in that it’s all we require. Well, true human happiness . . . if
you had that, what else do you need? Nothing.
And, second, true happiness should be something that I can obtain on my own. I shouldn’t have to rely on other people
for it. Many people value fame and seek fame. Fame for them becomes the goal. But, according to Aristotle, this won’t
work either, because fame depends altogether too much on other people. I can’t get it on my own, without help from other
people.
In the end, Aristotle says that true happiness is the exercise of reason—a life of intellectual contemplation . . . of
thinking. So let’s see how he comes to that.
TPO 2 Lecture 4 Astronomy
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an astronomy class. You will not need to remember the numbers the professor mentions.
Professor
OK. Let’s get going. Today I’m going to talk about how the asteroid belt was discovered. And . . . I’m going to start by
writing some numbers on the board. Here they are: We’ll start with zero, then 3, . . . 6, . . . 12. Uh, tell me what I’m doing.
Female student
Multiplying by 2?
Professor
Right. I’m doubling the numbers, so 2 times 12 is 24, and the next one I’m going to write after 24 would be . . .
Female student
48.
Professor
48. Then 96. We’ll stop there for now. Uh, now I’ll write another row of numbers under that. Tell me what I’m doing. 4,
7, 10 . . . How am I getting this second row?
22Male Student
Adding 4 to the numbers in the first row.
Professor
I’m adding 4 to each number in the first row to give you a second row. So the last two will be 52, 100, and now tell me
what I’m doing.
Female Student
Putting in a decimal?
Professor
Yes, I divided all those numbers by 10 by putting in a decimal point. Now I’m going to write the names of the planets
under the numbers. Mercury . . . Venus. . . Earth. . . Mars. So, what do the numbers mean? Do you remember from the
reading?
Male Student
Is it the distance of the planets from the Sun?
Professor
Right. In astronomical units—not perfect, but tantalizingly close. The value for Mars is off by . . . 6 or 7 percent or so.
It’s . . . but it’s within 10 percent of the average distance to Mars from the Sun. But I kind of have to skip the one after Mars
for now. Then Jupiter’s right there at 5-point something, and then Saturn is about 10 astronomical units from the Sun. Um,
well, this pattern is known as Bode’s Law.
Um, it isn’t really a scientific law, not in the sense of predicting gravitation mathematically or something, but it’s
attempting a pattern in the spacing of the planets, and it was noticed by Bode hundreds of years ago. Well, you can imagine
that there was some interest in why the 2.8 spot in the pattern was skipped, and um . . . but there wasn’t anything obvious
there, in the early telescopes. Then what happened in the late 1700s? The discovery of . . . ?
Female Student
Another planet?
Professor
The next planet out, Uranus—after Saturn.
And look, Uranus fits in the next spot in the pattern pretty nicely, um, not perfectly, but close. And so then people got
really excited about the validity of this thing and finding the missing object between Mars and Jupiter. And telescopes,
remember, were getting better. So people went to work on finding objects that would be at that missing distance from the
Sun, and then in 1801, the object Ceres was discovered.
And Ceres was in the right place—the missing spot. Uh, but it was way too faint to be a planet. It looked like a little
star. Uh, and because of its starlike appearance, um, it was called an “asteroid.” OK? “Aster” is Greek for “star,” as in
“astronomy.” Um, and so, Ceres was the first and is the largest of what became many objects discovered at that same
distance. Not just one thing, but all the objects found at that distance from the asteroid belt. So the asteroid belt is the most
famous success of this Bode’s Law. That’s how the asteroid belt was discovered.

Yeah.
Receptionist
Er…I’m sorry, but it says here that it was cancelled. You should have gotten a letter from the registrar’s office about
this.
Student
What? I’ve never got it.
Receptionist
Are you sure? ‘Cause it says on the computer that the letter was sent out to students a week ago.
Student
Really? I should have gotten it by now. I wonder if I threw it away with all the junk mail by mistake.
Receptionist
Well, it does happen. Er… let me check something. What’s your name?
Student
Woodhouse, Laura Woodhouse.
Receptionist
Ok, hmmm…Woodhouse, let me see… ah, it says here we sent it to your apartment on er… Center Street.
Student
Oh, that’s my old apartment. I moved out of there a little while ago.
24Receptionist
Well, and I suppose you haven’t changed your mailing address at the administration office. Well, that would explain it.
Student
Yeah, I guess that’s it. But how can they cancel the class after offering it. If I’d known this was going to happen, I
would have taken it last semester.
Receptionist
I know, it’s really inconvenient for you, I understand that, but er… if we don’t have enough students signed up for the
course, the college can’t offer it. You know, it’s a practical issue, like we can’t have an instructor when there’re only a few
students in the class. You see what I mean?
Student
I guess, but now I don’t know what course I should take instead.
Receptionist
Ok, let’s see. Do you have any courses you’re going to take next semester? If you do, you might want to take them now
and sign up for physics 403 next semester.
Student
Yeah, I guess I could do that. I just hope it won't be cancelled again. Do you know how many people have to be
enrolled in order to keep a class from being cancelled?
Receptionist
Well, it depends on the class, but for that class, you have to have er… let’s see, usually it’d be at least ten people, but
since it was cancelled this semester, they might even do it with less. But do you know what you should do? Give the physics
department a call a couple of weeks before the semester starts. They’ll be able to tell you if they’re planning to go through
with it. It's their decision, actually.
Student
Oh, ok, I will do that. Thanks for the info.
Receptionist
No problem. Sorry about the class. Oh, why don’t you go change your mailing address now. It’ll only takes a minute.
Student
Oh, oh, sure, I will do that right way.
TPO 3 Lecture 1 Environmental science
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an environmental science class.
Professor
Now, we’ve been talking about the loss of animal habitat from housing developments, um…, growing cities – small
habitat losses. But today I wanna begin talking about what happens when habitat is reduced across a large area. There are, of
25course, animal species that require large areas of habitat, and some migrate over very long distances. So what’s the impact
of habitat loss on those animals – animals that need large areas of habitat?
Well, I’ll use the humming birds as an example.
Now you know a humming bird is amazingly small, but even though it’s really tiny, it migrates over very long
distances, travels up and down the western hemisphere – the Americas, back and forth between where it breeds in the
summer and the warmer climates where it spends the winter. So we would say that this whole area over which it migrates is
its habitat because on this long-distance journey, it needs to come down to feed and sleep every so often, right?
Well, the humming bird beats its wings – get this – about 3 thousand times per minute. So you think, wow, it must need
a lot of energy, a lot of food, right? Well, it does. It drinks a lot of nectar from flowers and feeds on some insects, but it’s
energy-efficient too. You can’t say it isn’t. I mean, as it flies all the way across the Gulf of Mexico, it uses up almost none of
its body fat. But that doesn’t mean it doesn’t need to eat. So humming birds have to rely on plants in their natural habitat.
And it goes without saying, but, well, the opposite is true as well, plants depend on humming birds too. There are some
flowers that can only be pollinated by the humming birds. Without it stopping to feed and spreading pollen from flower to
flower, these plants would cease to exist.
But the problem, well, as natural habitat along these migration routes is developed by humans for housing or
agriculture or cleared for raising cattle, for instance, there is less food available for migrating humming birds. Their nesting
sites are affected too, the same, by the same sorts of human activities. And all of these activities pose a real threat to the
humming bird population.
So to help them survive, we need to preserve their habitats. And one of the concrete ways people have been doing this
is by cleaning up polluted habitat areas and then replanting flowers, um, replanting native flowers that humming birds feed
on.
Promoting ecological tourism is another way to help save their habitat. As the number of visitors, eco-tourists who
come to humming bird habitats to watch the birds, the more the number of visitors grows, the more local businesses profit,
so ecological tourism can bring financial rewards, all the more reason to value these beautiful little creatures in their habitat,
right?
But to understand more about how to protect and support humming birds the best we can, we’ve got to learn more
about their breeding, nesting sites and migration routes, and also about the natural habitats we find there. That should help
us determine how to prevent further decline in the population.
A good research method, a good way to learn more, is by running a banding study. Banding the birds allows us to track
them over their lifetime. It’s been a practice that’s been used by researchers for years. In fact, most of what we know about
humming birds comes from banding studies, where we capture a humming bird and make sure all the information about it,
like its weight and age and length, are all recorded, put into international, an international information database. And then
we place an extremely lightweight band on one of its legs, well, what looks like a leg, although technically it’s considered
part of the bird’s foot.
Anyway, these bands are perfectly safe, and some humming birds have worn them for years with no evidence of any
problems. The band is labeled with a tracking number, oh, and there is a phone number on the band for people to call for
free, to report a banded bird they’ve found or recaptured. So when a banded bird is recaptured and reported, we learn about
its migration route, its growth, and how long it has been alive, its lifespan. One recaptured bird had been banded almost 12
years earlier – she is one of the oldest humming birds on record.
26Another interesting thing we’ve learned is that some humming birds, um, they no longer use a certain route. They
travel by a different route to reach their destination. And findings like these have been of interest to biologists and
environmental scientists in a number of countries who are trying to understand the complexities of how changes in a habitat
affect the species in it.
TPO 3 Lecture 2 Film history
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a film history class.
Professor
Okay, we’ve been discussing films in the 1920s and 30s, and how back then film categories, as we know them today,
had not yet been established. We said that by today’s standards, many of the films of the 20s and 30s would be considered
hybrids, that is, a mixture of styles that wouldn’t exactly fit into any of today’s categories. And in that context, today we are
going to talk about a film-maker who began making very unique films in the late 1920s. He was French, and his name was
Jean Painlevé.
Jean Painlevé was born in 1902. He made his first film in 1928. Now in a way, Painlevé’s films conform to norms of
the 20s and 30s, that is, they don’t fit very neatly into the categories we use to classify films today. That said, even by the
standards of the 20s and 30s, Painlevé’s films were a unique hybrid of styles. He had a special way of fusing, or some
people might say, confusing, science and fiction. His films begin with facts, but then they become more and more fictional.
They gradually add more and more fictional elements. In fact, Painlevé was known for saying that science is fiction.
Painlevé was a pioneer in underwater film-making, and a lot of his short films focused on the aquatic animal world. He
liked to show small underwater creatures, displaying what seemed like familiar human characteristics – what we think of as
unique to humans. He might take a clip of a mollusk going up and down in the water and set it to music. You know, to make
it look as if the mollusk were dancing to the music like a human being – that sort of thing. But then he suddenly changed the
image or narration to remind us how different the animals are, how unlike humans.
He confused his audience in the way he portrayed the animals he filmed, mixing up our notions of the categories
human and animal. The films make us a little uncomfortable at times because we are uncertain about what we are seeing. It
gives him films an uncanny feature: the familiar made unfamiliar, the normal made suspicious. He liked twists, he liked the
unusual. In fact, one of his favorite sea animals was the seahorse because with seahorses, it’s the male that carries the eggs,
and he thought that was great. His first and most celebrated underwater film is about the seahorse.
Susan, you have a question?
Student 1
But underwater film-making wasn’t that unusual, was it? I mean, weren’t there other people making movies
underwater?
Professor
Well, actually, it was pretty rare at that time. I mean, we are talking the early 1930s here.
Student 1
But what about Jacques Cousteau? Was he like an innovator, you know, with underwater photography too?
27Professor
Ah, Jacques Cousteau. Well, Painlevé and Cousteau did both film underwater, and they were both innovators, so you
are right in that sense. But that’s pretty much where the similarities end.
First of all, Painlevé was about 20 years ahead of Cousteau. And Cousteau’s adventures were high-tech, with lots of
fancy equipment, whereas Painlevé kind of patchedequipment together as he needed it. Cousteau usually filmed large
animals, usually in the open sea, whereas Painlevé generally filmed smaller animals, and he liked to film in shallow water.
Uh, what else? Oh well, the main difference was that Cousteau simply investigated and presented the facts – he didn’t
mix in fiction. He was a strict documentarist. He set the standard really for the nature documentary. Painlevé, on the other
hand, as we said before, mixed in elements of fiction. And his films are much more artistic, incorporating music as an
important element.
John, you have a question?
Student 2
Well, maybe I shouldn’t be asking this, but if Painlevé’s films are so special, so good, why haven’t we ever heard of
them? I mean, everyone’s heard of Jacques Cousteau.
Professor
Well, that’s a fair question. Uh, the short answer is that Painlevé’s style just never caught on with the general public. I
mean, it probably goes back at least in part to what we mentioned earlier, that people didn’t know what to make of his films – they were confused by them, whereas Cousteau’s documentaries were very straightforward, met people’s expectations
more than Painlevé’s films did. But you true film history buffs know about him. And Painlevé is still highly respected in
many circles.
TPO 3 Conversation 2
Narrator
Listen to a conversation between a student and a professor.
Student
Hi, Professor Archer, you know how in class last week you said that you were looking for students who are interested
in volunteering for your archeology project?
Professor
Of course, are you volunteering?
Student
Yes, I am. It sounds really interesting, but um… do I need to have any experience for these kinds of projects?
Professor
No, not really. I assume that most students taking the introductory level class would have little or no experience with
archeological research, but that’s ok.
Student
28Oh, good, that’s a relief. Actually, that’s why I’m volunteering for the project — to get experience. What kind of work
is it?
Professor
Well, as you know, we're studying the history of the campus this semester. This used to be an agricultural area and we
already know that where the main lecture hall now stands, there once were farm house and barn that were erected in the late
1700s. We are excavating near the lecture hall to see what types of artifacts we find, you know, things people used in the
past that got buried when the campus was constructed. We’ve already begun to find some very interesting items, like old
bottles, buttons, pieces of clay pottery.
Student
Buttons and clay pottery? Did the old owners leave in such a hurry that they left their clothes and dishes behind?
Professor
Hmmm… that’s just one of the questions we hope to answer with this project.
Student
Wow, and it’s all right here on campus.
Professor
That’s right, no traveling involved. I wouldn't expect volunteers to travel to a site, especially in the middle of the
semester. We expect to find many more things, but we do need more people to help.
Student
So… how many student volunteers are you looking for?
Professor
I’m hoping to get five or six. I’ve asked for volunteers in all of the classes I teach, but no one has responded. You are
the first person to express interest.
Student
Sounds like it could be a lot of work. Is there um… is there any way I can use the experience to get some extra credit
in class? I mean, can I write a paper about it?
Professor
I think it’ll depend on what type of work you do in the excavation, but I imagine we can arrange something. Actually
I’ve been considering offering extra credit for class because I’ve been having a tough time getting volunteers. Extra credit is
always a good incentive for students.
Student
And how often would you want the volunteers to work?
Professor
We’re asking for three or four hours per week, depending on your schedule. A senior researcher, I think you know John
Franklin, my assistant, is on site every day.
Student
Sure, I know John. By the way, will there be some sort of training?
29Professor
Yes, er… I want to wait till Friday to see how many students volunteer, and then I’ll schedule a training class next
week at a time that’s convenient for everyone.
Student
Ok. I’ll wait to hear from you. Thanks a lot for accepting me.
TPO 3 Lecture 3 Art History
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an Art History class. The professor has been discussing the origins of art.
Professor
Some of the world’s oldest preserved art is the cave art of Europe, most of it in Spain and France. And the earliest cave
paintings found to date are those of the Chauvet Cave in France discovered in 1994.
And you know, I remember when I heard about the results of the dating of the Chauvet paintings, I said to my wife,
“Can you believe these paintings are over 30,000 years old?” And my 3-year-old daughter piped up and said, “Is that older
than my great-grandmother?” That was the oldest age she knew. And you know, come to think of it. It’s pretty hard for me
to really understand how long 30,000 years is too. I mean, we tend to think that people who lived at that time must have
been pretty primitive. But I’m gonna show you some slides in a few minutes and I think you will agree with me that this art
is anything but primitive. They are masterpieces. And they look so real, so alive that it’s very hard to imagine that they are
so very old.
Now, not everyone agrees on exactly how old. A number of the Chauvet paintings have been dated by a lab to 30,000
or more years ago. That would make them not just older than any other cave art, but about twice as old as the art in the
caves at Altamira or Lascaux, which you may have heard of. Some people find it hard to believe Chauvet is so much older
than Altamira and Lascaux, and they noted that only one lab did the dating for Chauvet, without independent confirmation
from any other lab. But be that as it may, whatever the exact date, whether it’s 15,000, 20,000 or 30,000 years ago, the
Chauvet paintings are from the dawn of art. So they are a good place to start our discussion of cave painting.
Now, one thing you’ve got to remember is the context of these paintings. Paleolithic humans - that’s the period we are
talking about here, the Paleolithic, the early stone age, not too long after humans first arrived in Europe - the climate was
significantly colder then, and so rock shelters, shallow caves were valued as homes protected from the wind and rain. And
in some cases at least, artists drew on the walls of their homes.
But many of the truly great cave art sites like Chauvet were never inhabited. These paintings were made deep inside a
dark cave, where no natural light can penetrate. There’s no evidence of people ever living here. Cave bears, yes, but not
humans. You would have had to make a special trip into the cave to make the paintings, and a special trip to go see it. And
each time you’d have to bring along torches to light your way. And people did go see the art. There’s charcoal marks fromtheir torches on the cave walls clearly dating from thousands of years after the paintings were made. So we can tell people
went there. They came but they didn’t stay. Deep inside a cave like that is not really a place you’d want to stay, so, why?
What inspired the Paleolithic artists to make such beautiful art in such inaccessible places? We’ll never really know of
course, though it’s interesting to speculate.
But, um, getting to the paintings themselves, virtually all Paleolithic cave art represents animals, and Chauvet is no
exception. The artists were highly skilled at using, or even enhancing, the natural shape of the cave walls to give depth and
30perspectives to their drawings, the sense of motion and vitality in these animals. Well, wait till I show you the slides.
Anyway, most Paleolithic cave art depicts large herbivores. Horses are most common overall with deer and bison pretty
common too, probably animals they hunted.
But earlier at Chauvet, there is a significant interest in large dangerous animals, lots of rhinoceros, lions, mammoth,
bears. Remember that the ranges of many animal species were different back then, so all these animals actually lived in the
region at that time.
But the Chauvet artists didn’t paint people. There is a half-man-half-bison creature and there is outlines of human
hands but no depiction of a full human.
So, why these precise animals? Why not birds, fish, snakes? Was it for their religion, magic or sheer beauty? We don’t
know. But whatever it was, it was worth it to them to spend hours deep inside a cave with just a torch between them and
utter darkness. So, on that note, let’s dim the lights, so we can see these slides and actually look at the techniques they used.
TPO 3 Lecture 4 Astronomy
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an astronomy class.
Professor
Now astronomy didn’t really bloom into the science it is today until the development of spectroscopy.
Spectroscopy is basically the study of spectra and spectral lines of light, and specifically for us, the light from stars. It
makes it possible to analyze the light emitted from stars. When you analyze this light, you can figure out their distance fromthe Earth, and identify what they are made of, determine their chemical composition.
Before we get into that though, it’s probably a good thing to back up a bit. You all know how when you take a crystal
prism and pass a beam of sunlight through it, you get a spectrum, which looks like a continuous band of rainbow colors. The
light that we see with our human eyes as a band of rainbow color falls in the range of what’s called visible light. And visible
light spectroscopy is probably the most important kind of spectroscopy.
Anyone want to take a stab at the scientific term for visible light? And I’m sure all of you know this because you all
did the reading for today.
Student
Optical radiation. But I thought being exposed to radiation is dangerous.
Professor
Yes, and no. If you are talking about radiation, like in the element Uranium, yeah, that’s dangerous. But radiation as a
general term actually refers to anything that spreads away from its source. So optical radiation is just visible light energy
spreading out.
OK, so we’ve got a spectrum of a beam of sunlight and it looks like the colors bleed into each other. There are no
interruptions, just a band flowing from violet to green, to yellow, to… you get the idea.
Well, what happens if the sunlight’s spectrum is magnified? Maybe you all didn’t do the reading. Well, here’s what
31you’d see. I want you to notice that this spectrum is interrupted by dark lines called spectral lines. If you really magnify the
spectrum of the sunlight, you could identify more than 100,000 of them. They may look like kind of randomly placed, but
they actually form many distinct patterns. And if you were looking at the spectrum of some other star, the colors would be
the same. But the spectral lines would break it up at different places, making different patterns. Each pattern stands for a
distinct chemical element, and so different sets or patterns of spectral lines mean that the star has a different chemical
composition.
Student
So how do we know which spectral patterns match up with which elements?
Professor
Well, a kind of spectroscopic library of elements was compiled using flame tests. A known element, say a piece of iron
for example, is heated in a pure gas flame. The iron eventually heats to the point that it radiates light. This light is passed
through a prism, which breaks it up into a spectrum. And a unique pattern, kind of like a chemical fingerprint of spectral
lines for that element appears. This process was repeated over and over again for many different elements, so we can figure
out the chemical makeup of another star by comparing the spectral pattern it has to the pattern of the elements in the library.
Oh, an interesting story about how one of the elements was discovered through spectroscopy. There was a pretty
extensive library of spectral line patterns of elements even by the 1860s. A British astronomer was analyzing a spectrograph
of sunlight, and he noticed a particular pattern of spectral lines that didn’t match anything in the library. So he put two and
two together, and decided there was an element in the sun that hadn’t been discovered here on the earth yet.
Any guesses about what that element is? It actually turned out to be pretty common and I’m sure all of you know it.
OK. Let’s try something else. Any of you happened to be familiar with the Greek word for “sun” by chance?
Student
Something like “Helius” or something like that. Oh, it must be “Helium”. So you are saying that Helium was
discovered on the sun first.
Professor
Yes, and this is a good example of how important spectroscopy is in astronomy.
TPO 4
Conversation 1
Narrator
Listen to a conversation between a student and a librarian.
Librarian
Can I help you?
Student
Yeah, I need to find a review. It’s for my English class. We have to find reviews of the play we are reading. But they
have to be from when the play was first performed, so I need to know when that was and I suppose I should start with
newspaper reviews and…
Librarian
32Contemporary reviews.
Student
Sorry?
Librarian
You want contemporary reviews. What’s the name of the play?
Student
It’s Happy Strangers. It was written in 1962 and we are supposed to write about its influence on American theatre and
show why it’s been so important.
Librarian
Well, that certainly explains why your professor wants you to read some of those old reviews. The critiques really tore
the play to pieces when it opened. It’s so controversial. Nobody had ever seen anything like it on the stage.
Student
Really? Is that a big deal?
Librarian
Oh, sure. Of course the critics’ reaction made some people kind of curious about it. They wanted to see what was
causing all the fuss. In fact, we were on vacation in New York. Oh, I had to be, oh, around 16 or so, and my parents took me
to see it. That would’ve been about 1965.
Student
So that was the year it premiered? Great! But uh, newspapers from back then aren’t online, so, how do I…
Librarian
Well, we have copies of old newspapers in the basement, and all the major papers publish reference guides to their
articles, reviews, etc. You will find them in the reference stacks in the back. But I start with 1964, I think the play had been
running for a little while when I saw it.
Student
How do you like it? I mean just two characters on the stage hanging around basically doing nothing.
Librarian
Well, I was impressed. The actors were famous, and besides it was my first time in a real theatre. But you are right. It
was definitely different from many plays that we read in high school. Of course, in a small town the assignments are pretty
traditional.
Student
Yeah, I’ve only read it but it doesn’t seem like it would be much fun to watch. The story doesn’t progress in any sort of
logical matter, doesn’t have real ending either, just stops. Honestly, you know, I thought it was kind of slow and boring.
Librarian
Oh, well I guess you might think that. But when I saw it back then it was anything but boring. Some parts were really
funny, but I remember crying too. But I’m not sure just reading it. You know, they’ve done this play at least once on campus.
I’m sure there is a tape of the play in our video library. You might want to borrow it.
33Student
That’s a good idea. I’ll have a better idea of what I really think of it before I read those reviews.
Librarian
I’m sure you will be surprised that anyone ever found it radical. But you will see why it is still powerful, dramatically
speaking.
Student
Well, there must be something about it, or the professor wouldn’t have assigned it. I’m sure I’ll figure it out.
TPO 4 Lecture 1 Biology
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a biology class. The class is discussing animal behavior.
Professor
Ok, the next kind of animal behavior I want to talk about might be familiar to you. You may have seen, for example, a
bird that’s in the middle of a mating ritual, and suddenly it stops and preens, you know, it takes a few moments to straighten
its feathers, and then returns to the mating ritual. This kind of behavior, this doing something that seems completely out of
place, is what we call a ‘Displacement Activity’.
Displacement activities are activities that animals engage in when they have conflicting drives. If we take our example
from a minute ago, if the bird is afraid of its mate, it’s conflicted. It wants to mate but it’s also afraid and wants to run away.
So, instead, it starts grooming itself. So, the displacement activity, the grooming, the straightening of its feathers, seems to
be an irrelevant behavior.
So, what do you think another example of a displacement activity might be?
Karl
How about an animal that, um, instead of fighting its enemy or running away, it attacks a plant or a bush?
Professor
That’s really good suggestion, Karl. But that’s called ‘redirecting’. The animal is redirecting its behavior to another
object, in this case, the plant or the bush. But that’s not an irrelevant or inappropriate behavior. The behavior makes sense. It’s appropriate under the circumstances. But what doesn’t make sense is the object the behavior‘s directed towards.
Ok, who else? Carol?
Carol
I think I read in another class about an experiment where an object that the animal was afraid of was put next to its
food – next to the animal’s food. And the animal, it was conflicted between confronting the object and eating the food, so
instead, it just fell asleep. Like that?
Professor
That’s exactly what I mean. Displacement occurs because the animal’s got two conflicting drives – two competing
urges, in this case, fear and hunger. And what happens is, they inhibit each other, they cancel each other out in a way, and a
third seemingly irrelevant behavior surfaces through a process that we call ‘Disinhibition’.
34Now, in disinhibition, the basic idea is that two drives that seem to inhibit, to hold back, a third drive. Well, well,
they’re getting in a way of each other in a… in a conflict situation and somehow lose control, lose their inhibiting effect on
that third behavior, which means that the third drive surfaces, it’s expressed in the animal’s behavior.
Now, these displacement activities can include feeding, drinking, grooming, even sleeping. These are what we call
‘Comfort Behavior’. So why do you think displacement activities are so often comfort behaviors, such as grooming?
Karl
Maybe because it’s easy for them to do? I mean, grooming is like one of the most accessible things an animal can do.
It’s something they do all the time, and they have the stimulus right there on the outside of their bodies in order to do the
grooming, or if food is right in front of them. Basically, they don’t have to think very much about those behaviors.
Carol
Professor, isn’t it possible that animals groom because they’ve got messed up a little from fighting or mating? I mean if
a bird’s feathers get ruffled or an animal’s fur, maybe it’s not so strange for them to stop and tidy themselves up at that
point.
Professor
That’s another possible reason although it doesn’t necessarily explain other behaviors such as eating, drinking or
sleeping.
What’s interesting is that studies have been done that suggest that the animal’s environment may play a part in
determining what kind of behavior it displays. For example, there’s a bird, the ‘wood thrush’, anyway, when the ‘wood
thrush’ is in an attack-escape conflict, that is, it’s caught between the two urges to escape from or to attack an enemy, if it’s
sitting on a horizontal branch, it’ll wipe its beak on its perch. If it’s sitting on a vertical branch, it’ll groom its breast feathers.
The immediate environment of the bird, its immediate, um, its relationship to its immediate environment seems to play a
part in which behavior will display.
TPO 4 Lecture 2 Literature
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a literature class.
Professor
All right, so let me close today’s class with some thoughts to keep in mind while you are doing tonight’s assignment.
You will be reading one of Ralph Waldo Emerson’s best-known essays ‘Self-Reliance’ and comparing it with his poems and
other works.
I think this essay has the potential to be quite meaningful for all of you as young people who probably wonder about
things like truth and where your lives are going - all sorts of profound questions.
Knowing something about Emerson’s philosophies will help you when you read ‘Self-Reliance’. And basically, one of
the main beliefs that he had was about truth. Not that it’s something that we can be taught, Emerson says it’s found within
ourselves. So this truth, the idea that it’s in each one of us, is one of the first points that you’ll see Emerson making in this
essay. It’s a bit abstract but he’s very into…uh… into each person believing his or her own thought, believing in yourself,
the thought or conviction that’s true for you.
35But actually, he ties that in with a sort of ‘universal truth’ – something that everyone knows but doesn’t realize they
know. Most of us are in touch with ourselves in a way, so we just aren’t capable of recognizing profound truth. It takes
geniuses, people like, say, Shakespeare, who’re unique because when they have a glimpse of this truth, this universal truth,
they pay attention to it and express it and don’t just dismiss it like most people do.
So Emerson is really into each individual believing in and trusting him or herself. You’ll see that he writes about, well,
first, conformity. He criticizes that people of his time for abandoning their own minds and their own wills for the sake of
conformity and consistency. They try to fit in with the rest of the world even though it’s at odds with their beliefs and their
identities. Therefore, it’s best to be a non-conformist – to do your own thing, not worrying about what other people think.
That’s an important point. He really drives this argument home throughout the essay.
When you are reading, I want you to think about that and why that kind of thought would be relevant to the readers of
his time. Remember this is 1838,‘Self-Reliance’ was a novel idea at the time and the United States citizens were less secure
about themselves as individuals and as Americans. The country as a whole was trying to define itself. Emerson wanted to
give people something to really think about, help them find their own way and what it meant to be who they were. So that’s
something that I think is definitely as relevant today as it was then, probably, um, especially among young adults like
yourselves, you know, uh, college being a time to sort of really think about who you are and where you’re going.
Now, we already said that Emerson really emphasizes non-conformity, right? As a way to sort of not lose your own self
and identity in the world, to have your own truth and not be afraid to listen to it.
Well, he takes this a step further. Not conforming also means, uh, not conforming with yourself or your past. What
does that mean? Well, if you’ve always been a certain way or done a certain thing, but it’s not working for you any more, or
you’re not content, Emerson says that it’d be foolish to be consistent even with our own past.“Focus on the future,” he says,
“That's what matters more. Inconsistency is good.”
He talks about a ship’s voyage and this is one of the most famous bits of the essay - how the best voyage is made up of
zigzag lines. Up close, it seems a little all over the place, but from farther away, the true path shows and in the end it
justifies all the turns along the way. So, don’t worry if you are not sure where you’re headed or what your long-term goals
are. Stay true to yourself and it’ll make sense in the end. I mean, I can attest to that. Before I was a literature professor, I
was an accountant. Before that, I was a newspaper reporter. My life is taking some pretty interesting turns and here I am,
very happy with my experiences and where they’ve brought me. If you rely on yourself and trust your own talents, your
own interest, don’t worry, your path will make sense in the end.
TPO 4 Conversation 2
Narrator
Listen to a conversation between a student and a professor.
Professor
Hey, Jane, you look like you are in a hurry.
Student
Yeah, things are a little crazy.
Professor
Oh yeah? What’s going on?
36Student
Oh, it’s nothing. Well, since it’s your class, I guess it’s OK. It’s, it’s just that I am having trouble with my group
project.
Professor
Ah, yes, due next week. What’s your group doing again?
Student
It’s about United States Supreme Court Decisions. We are looking at the impact of recent cases on property rights,
municipal land use cases, owning disputes.
Professor
Right, OK. And it’s not going well?
Student
Not really. I’m worried about the other two people in my group. They are just sitting back, not really doing their fair
share of the work and waiting for an A. It’s kind of stressing me out, because we are getting close to the deadline and I feel
like I’m doing everything for this project.
Professor
Ah, the good old free rider problem.
Student
Free rider?
Professor
Ah, it’s just a term that describes this situation, when people in the group seek to get the benefits of being in a group
without contributing to the work. Anyway, what exactly do you mean when you say they just sit back? I mean, they’ve been
filing the weekly progress reports with me.
Student
Yes, but I feel like I’m doing 90% of the work. I hate to sound so negative here, but honestly, they are taking credit for
things they shouldn’t take credit for. Like last week in the library, we decided to split up the research into 3 parts and then
each of us was supposed to find sources in the library for our parts. I went off to the stack and found some really good
material for my part, but when I got back to our table, they were just goofing off and talking. So I went and got materials for
their sections as well.
Professor
Um…you know you shouldn’t do that.
Student
I know, but I didn’t want to risk the project going down the drain.
Professor
I know Teresa and Kevin. I had both of them in other courses. So, I’m familiar with the work and work habits.
Student
I know, me too. And that’s why this has really surprised me.
37Professor
Do you…does your group like your topic?
Student
Well, I think we’d all rather focus on cases that deal with personal liberties, questions about freedom of speech, things
like that. But I chose property rights.
Professor
You chose the topic?
Student
Yeah, I thought it would be good for us, all of us to try something new.
Professor
Um…maybe that’s part of the problem. Maybe Teresa and Kevin aren’t that excited about the topic? And since you
picked it, have you thought…talk to them at all about picking a different topic?
Student
But we’ve got all the sources and it’s due next week. We don’t have time to start from scratch.
Professor
OK, I will let you go ‘cause I know you are so busy. But you might consider talking to your group about your topic
choice.
Student
I will think about it. Got to run, see you in class.
TPO 4 Lecture 3 Geology
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a geology class.
Professor
Now we’ve got a few minutes before we leave for today. So I’ll just touch on an interesting subject that I think makes
an important point.
We’ve been covering rocks and different types of rocks for the last several weeks. But next week we are going to do
something a bit different. And to get started I thought I’d mention something that shows how uh…as a geologist, you need
to know about more than just rocks and the structure of solid matter.
Moving rocks, you may have heard about them. It’s quite a mystery. Death valley is this desert plain, a dry lake bed in
California surrounded by mountains and on the desert floor these huge rocks, some of them hundreds of pounds. And they
move. They leave long trails behind them, tracks you might say as they move from one point to another. But nobody has
been able to figure out how they are moving because no one has ever seen it happen.
38Now there are a lot of theories, but all we know for sure is that people aren’t’ moving the rocks. There are no footprints,
no type tracks and no heavy machinery like a bulldozer…uh, nothing was ever brought in to move these heavy rocks.
So what’s going on? Theory NO.1 ---Wind. Some researchers think powerful uh…windstorms might move the rocks.
Most of the rocks move in the same direction as the dominant wind pattern from southwest to northeast. But some, and this
is interesting, move straight west while some zigzag or even move in large circles. Hmm…How can that be?
How about wind combined with rain? The ground of this desert is made of clay. It’s a desert, so it’s dry. But when there
is the occasional rain, the clay ground becomes extremely slippery. It’s hard for anyone to stand on, walk on. Some
scientists theorized that perhaps when the ground is slippery the high winds can then move the rocks. There’s a problemwith this theory. One team of scientists flooded an area of the desert with water, then try to establish how much wind force
would be necessary to move the rocks. And get this: you need winds of at least five hundred miles an hour to move just the
smallest rocks! And winds that strong have never been recorded. Ever! Not on this planet. So I think it’s safe to say that that
issues has been settled.
Here is another possibility – ice. It’s possible that rain on the desert floor could turn to thin sheets of ice when
temperatures drop at night. So if rocks…uh become embedded in ice, uh … OK, could a piece of ice with rocks in it be
pushed around by the wind? But there’s a problem with this theory, too. Rocks trapped in ice together would have moved
together when the ice moved. But that doesn’t always happen. The rocks seem to take separate routes.
There are a few other theories. Maybe the ground vibrates, or maybe the ground itself is shifting, tilting. Maybe the
rocks are moved by a magnetic force. But sadly all these ideas have been eliminated as possibilities. There’s just no
evidence. I bet you are saying to yourself well, why don’t scientists just set up video cameras to record what actually
happens? Thing is, this is a protected wilderness area. So by law that type of research isn’t allowed. Besides, in powerful
windstorms, sensitive camera equipment would be destroyed. So why can’t researchers just live there for a while until they
observe the rocks moving? Same reason.
So where are we now? Well, right now we still don’t have any answers. So all this leads back to my main point – you
need to know about more than just rocks as geologists. The researchers studying moving rocks, well, they combine their
knowledge of rocks with knowledge of wind, ice and such…uh not successfully, not yet. But you know, they wouldn’t even
have been able to get started without um… earth science understanding – knowledge about wind, storms, you know,
meteorology. You need to understand physics. So for several weeks like I said we’ll be addressing geology from a wider
perspective. I guess that’s all for today. See you next time.
TPO 4 Lecture 4 United States government
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a United States government class.
Professor
OK, last time we were talking about government support for the arts. Who can sum up some of the main points?
Frank?
Frank
Well, I guess there wasn’t really any, you know, official government support for the arts until the twentieth century. But
the first attempt the United States government made to, you know, to support the arts was the Federal Art Project.
39Professor
Right, so what can you say about the project?
Frank
Um…it was started during the Depression, um…in the 1930s to employ out of-work artists.
Professor
So was it successful? Janet? What do you say?
Janet
Yeah, sure, it was successful. I mean, for one thing, the project established a lot of…uh like community art centers and
galleries in places like rural areas where people hadn’t really had access to the arts.
Professor
Right.
Frank
Yeah. But didn’t the government end up wasting a lot of money for art that wasn’t even very good?
Professor
Uh…some people might say that. But wasn’t the primary objective of the Federal Art Project to provide jobs?
Frank
That’s true. I mean…it did provide jobs for thousands of unemployed artists.
Professor
Right. But then when the United States became involved in the Second World War, unemployment was down and it
seems that these programs weren’t really necessary any longer.
So, moving on, we don't actually see any govern…well any real government involvement in the arts again until the
early 1960s, when President Kennedy and other politicians started to push for major funding to support and promote the arts.
It was felt by a number of politicians that …well that the government had a responsibility to support the arts as sort of… oh,
what can we say?...the the soul…or spirit of the country. The idea was that there be a federal subsidy…um…uh…financial
assistance to artists and artistic or cultural institutions. And for just those reasons, in 1965, the National Endowment for the
Arts was created. So it was through the NEA, the National Endowment for the Arts, um…that the arts would develop,
would be promoted throughout the nation.
And then individual states throughout the country started to establish their own state arts councils to help support the
arts. There was kind of uh…cultural explosion. And by the mid 1970s, by 1974 I think, all fifty states had their own arts
agencies, their own state arts councils that work with the federal government with corporations, artists, performers, you
name it.
Frank
Did you just say corporations? How are they involved?
Professor
Well, you see, corporations aren’t always altruistic. They might not support the arts unless…well, unless the
government made it attractive for them to do so, by offering corporations tax incentives to support the arts, that is, by letting
40corporations pay less in taxes if they were patrons of the arts. Um, the Kennedy Centre in Washington D.C. , you may
uh…maybe you’ve been there, or Lincoln Centre in New York. Both of these were built with substantial financial support
from corporations. And the Kennedy and Lincoln center’s aren’t the only examples. Many of your cultural establishments in
the United States will have a plaque somewhere acknowledging the support – the money they received from whatever
corporation. Oh, yes, Janet?
Janet
But aren’t there a lot of people who don’t think it’s the government’s role to support the arts?
Professor
Well, as a matter of fact, a lot of politicians who did not believe in government support for the arts, they wanted to do
away with the agency entirely, for that very reason, to get rid of governmental support. But they only succeeded in taking
away about half the annual budget. And as far as the public goes, well…there are about as many individuals who disagree
with the government support as there are those who agree.
In fact, with artists in particular, you have lots of artists who support and who have benefited from this agency,
although it seems that just as many artists oppose the government agency being involved in the arts, for many different
reasons, reasons like they don’t want the government to control what they create. In other words, the arguments both for and
against government funding of the arts are as many and, and as varied as the individual styles of the artists who hold them.

Conversation 1
Narrator
Listen to a conversation between a student and a counselor at the University Counseling Center.
Student
Hi, thanks for seeing me on such short notice.
Counselor
No problem. How can I help?
Student
Well, I think I might have made a mistake coming to the school.
Counselor
What makes you say that?
Student
I’m a little overwhelmed by the size of this place. I come from a small town. There were only 75 of us in my high
school graduating class. Everyone knew everyone. We all grew up together.
Counselor
So it’s a bit of a culture shock for you? Being one of 15,000 students on a big campus in an unfamiliar city?
Student
41That’s an understatement. I just can’t get comfortable in class or in the dorms. You know, socially.
Counselor
Hmmm…well, let’s start with your academics. Tell me about your classes.
Student
I’m taking mostly introductory courses and some are taught in these huge lecture halls.
Counselor
And you are having trouble in keeping pace with the material?
Student
No, in fact I got an A on my first economics paper. It’s just that, it’s so impersonal, I’m not used to it.
Counselor
Are all your classes impersonal?
Student
No, it’s just that…for example, in sociology yesterday, the professor asked a question, so I raised my hand, several of
us raised our hands. And I kept my hand up because I did the reading and knew the answer. But the professor just answered
his own question and continued with the lecture.
Counselor
Well, in a big room it’s possible he didn’t notice you. Maybe he was trying to save time. In either case I wouldn’t take
it personally.
Student
I suppose. But I just don’t know how to, you know, distinguish myself.
Counselor
Why not stop by his office during office hours?
Student
That wouldn’t seem right. You know, taking time from other students who need help?
Counselor
Don’t say that. That’s what office hours are for. There is no reason you couldn’t pop in to say hi and to make yourself
known. If you are learning a lot in class, let the professor know. Wouldn’t you appreciate positive feedback if you were a
professor?
Student
You are right. That’s a good idea.
Counselor
OK, er…let’s turn to your social life. How’s it going in the dorms?
Student
I don’t have much in common with my roommate or anyone else I’ve met so far. Everyone’s into sports and I’m more
artsy, you know, into music. I play the cello.
42Counselor
Hah, have you been playing long?
Student
Since age ten. It’s a big part of my life. At home I was the youngest member of our community orchestra.
Counselor
You are not going to believe this. There is a string quartet on campus, all students. And it so happened that the cellist
graduated last year. They’ve been searching high and low for a replacement, someone with experience. Would you be
interested in auditioning?
Student
Absolutely. I wanted to get my academic work settled before pursuing my music here. But I think this would be a good
thing for me. I guess if I really want to fit in here I should find people who love music as much as I do. Thank you.
Counselor
My pleasure.
TPO 5 Lecture 1 Sociology
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a sociology class.
Professor:
Have you ever heard the one about alligators living in New York sewers? The story goes like this: a family went on
vacation in Florida and bought a couple of baby alligators as presents for their children, then returned from vacation to New
York, bringing the alligators home with them as pets. But the alligators would escape and find their way into the New York
sewer system where they started reproducing, grew to huge sizes and now strike fear into sewer workers. Have you heard
this story? Well, it isn’t true and it never happened. But despite that, the story has been around since the 1930s.
Or how about the song ‘twinkle, twinkle little star’, you know, ‘twinkle, twinkle, little star, how I wonder what you
are’. Well we’ve all heard this song. Where am I going with this? Well, both the song and the story are examples of memes.
And that’s what we would talk about, the theory of memes.
A meme is defined as a piece of information copied from person to person. By this definition, most of what you know,
ideas, skills, stories, songs are memes. All the words you know, all the scientific theories you’ve learned, the rules your
parents taught you to observe, all are memes that have been passed on from person to person.
So what? You may say. Passing on ideas from one person to another is nothing new. Well, the whole point of defining
this familiar process as transmission of memes is so that we can explore its analogy with the transmission of genes. As you
know, all living organisms pass on biological information through the genes. What’s a gene? A gene is a piece of biological
information that gets copied or replicated, and the copy or replica is passed on to the new generation. So genes are defined
as replicators. Genes are replicators that pass on information about properties and characteristics of organisms. By analogy,
memes also get replicated and in the process pass on cultural information from person to person, generation to generation.
So memes are also replicators.
43To be a successful replicator, there are three key characteristics: longevity, fecundity and fidelity. Let’s take a closer
look.
First, longevity. A replicator must exist long enough to be able to get copied, and transfer its information. Clearly, the
longer a replicator survives, the better its chances of getting its message copied and passed on. So longevity is a key
characteristic of a replicator. If you take the alligator story, it can exist for a long time in individual memory, let’s say, my
memory. I can tell you the story now or ten years from now, the same with the twinkle, twinkle song. So these memes have
longevity because they are memorable for one reason or another.
Next, fecundity. Fecundity is the ability to reproduce in large numbers. For example, the common housefly reproduces
by laying several thousand eggs, so each fly gene gets copied thousands of times. Memes, well, they can be reproduced in
large numbers as well. How many times have you sung the‘twinkle, twinkle song’ to someone? Each time you replicated
that song, and maybe passed it along to someone who did not know it yet, a small child maybe.
And finally, fidelity. Fidelity means accuracy of the copying process. We know fidelity is an essential principle of
genetic transmission. If a copy of a gene is a bit different from the original, that’s called a genetic mutation. And mutations
are usually bad news. An organism often cannot survive with a mutated gene. And so a gene usually cannot be passed on,
unless it’s an exact copy. For memes however, fidelity is not always so important. For example, if you tell someone the
alligator story I told you today, it probably won’t be word for word exactly as I said it. Still, it will be basically the same
story, and the person who hears the story will be able to pass it along.
Other memes are replicated with higher fidelity though, like the twinkle, twinkle song. It had the exact same words 20
years ago as it does now. Well, that’s because we see songs as something that has to be performed accurately each time. If
you change a word, the others will usually bring you in line. They’ll say, ‘that’s not how you sing it’, right?
So, you can see how looking at pieces of cultural information as replicators, as memes, and analyzing them in terms of
longevity, fecundity and fidelity, we can gain some insight about how they spread, persist or change
TPO 5 Lecture 2 Astronomy
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an Astronomy Class
Professor:
Last week, we covered some arguments against going back to the Moon. But there are compelling reasons in favor of
another Moon landing too, um… not the least of which is trying to pinpoint the moon’s age.
We could do this in theory by studying an enormous impact crater, known as the South Pole-Aitken Basin. Um…it’s
located in the moon’s South Polar Region. But, since it’s on the far side of the moon, it can only be seen from space.
Here is an image of…we’ll call it the SPA Basin. This color-coated image of the SPA Basin, those aren’t its actual
colors obviously, this image is from the mid 90s, from the American spacecraft called Clementine. Um… unlike earlier
lunar missions, Clementine didn’t orbit only around the moon’s equator. Its orbits enabled it to send back data to create this
topographical map of … well, the grey and white area towards the bottom is the South Pole, the purples and blues in the
middle correspond to low elevations - the SPA Basin itself, the oranges and reds around it are higher elevations.
44The basin measures an amazing 2,500 km in diameter, and its average depth is 12 km. That makes it the biggest known
crater in our solar system and it may well be the oldest. You know planetary researchers love studying deep craters to learn
about the impacts that created them, how they redistributed pieces of the planet’s crust. And in this case, we especially want
to know if any of the mantle, the layer beneath the crust, was exposed by the impact. Not everyone agrees, but some experts
are convinced that whatever created the SPA Basin did penetrate the Moon’s mantle. And we need to find out, because much
more than the crust, the mantle contains information about a planet’s or Moon’s total composition. And that’s key to
understanding planet formation. Um…Dian?
Dian:
So, the only way to know the basin’s age is to study its rocks directly?
Professor:
Well, from radio survey data, we know that the basin contains lots of smaller craters. So it must be really old, about 4
billion years, give or take a few hundred million years. But that’s not very precise. If we had rock samples to study, we’d
know whether these small craters were formed by impacts during the final stages of planetary formation, or if they resulted
from later meteor showers.
Dian:
But if we know around how old the Basin is, I’m not sure that’s reason enough to go to the Moon again.
Professor:
No…, but such crude estimates…um…we can do better than that.
Besides, there’s other things worth investigating, like is there water ice on the moon? Clementine’s data indicated that
the wall of the south-polar crater was more reflective than expected. So some experts think there’s probably ice there. Also,
data from a later mission indicates significant concentrations of hydrogen and by inference water less than a meter
underground at both poles.
Student:
Well, if there’s water, how did it get there? Underground rivers?
Professor:
We think meteors that crashed into the moon or tails of passing comets may have introduced water molecules. Any
water molecules that found their way to the floors of craters near the moon’s poles, that water would be perpetually frozen,
because the floors of those craters are always in shadow. Um…furthermore, if the water ice was mixed in with rock and dust,
it would be protected from evaporation.
Dian:
So are you saying there might be primitive life on the moon?
Professor:
That’s not my point at all. Um… o.k., say there is water ice on the moon. That would be of very practical value for a
future moon base for astronauts. Water ice could be melted and purified for drinking. It could also be broken down into its
component parts - oxygen and hydrogen. Oxygen could be used to breathe, and hydrogen could be turned into fuel, rocket
fuel. So water ice could enable the creation of a self-sustaining moon base someday, a mining camp perhaps or a departure
point for further space exploration.
Student:
But hauling tons of equipment to the moon to make fuel and build a life support system for a moon base, wouldn’t that
45be too expensive?
Professor:
Permanent base, maybe a ways off, but we shouldn’t have to wait for that. The dust at the bottom of the SPA Basin
really does have a fascinating story to tell. I wouldn’t give for a few samples of it.
TPO 5 Conversation 2
Narrator
Listen to a conversation between a student and a professor.
Student
Hi, I was wondering if I could talk with you about the assignment in the film theory class.
Professor
Of course, Jill.
Student
It seems that pretty much everyone else in the class gets what they are supposed to be doing but I’m not so sure.
Professor
Well, the class is for students who are really serious about film. You must have taken film courses before.
Student
Yeah, in high school, film appreciation.
Professor
Hmmm…I wouldn’t think that would be enough. Did you concentrate mainly on form or content?
Student
Oh, definitely content. We’d watch, say Lord of the Flies, and then discuss it.
Professor
Oh, that approach, treating film as literature, ignoring what makes it unique.
Student
I liked it, though.
Professor
Sure, but that kind of class. Well, I’m not surprised that you are feeling a little lost. You know, we have two
introductory courses that are supposed to be taken before you get to my course, one in film art, techniques, technical stuff
and another in film history. So students in the class you are in should be pretty far along in film studies. In fact, usually the
system blocks anyone trying to sign up for a class they shouldn’t be taking, who hasn’t taken the courses you are required to
do first as prerequisites.
Student
Well, I did have a problem with that but I discussed it with one of your office staff, and she gave me permission.
46Professor
Of course. No matter how many times I tell them, they just keep on…
Well, for your own good, I’d really suggest dropping back and starting at the usual place.
Student
Yes. But I’ve already been in this class for 4 weeks. I’d hate to just drop it now especially since I find it so different, so
interesting.
Professor
I guess so. Frankly I can’t believe you’ve lasted this long. These are pretty in-depth theories we’ve been discussing and
you’ve been doing OK so far, I guess. But still, the program’s been designed to progress through certain stages. Like any
other professional training we build on pervious knowledge.
Student
Then maybe you could recommend some extra reading I can do to… catch up?
Professor
Well, are you intending to study film as your main concentration?
Student
No, no. I am just interested. I’m actually in marketing, but there seems to be a connection.
Professor
Oh…well, in…in that case, if you’re taking the course just out of interest, I mean I still highly recommend signing up
for the introductory courses at some point, but in the meantime, there is no harm I guess in trying to keep up with this class.
The interest is clearly there. Eh, instead of any extra reading just now though, you could view some of the old introductory
lectures. We have them on video. That would give you a better handle on the subject. It’s still a pretty tall order, and we will
be moving right along, so you will really need to stay on top of it.
Student
OK, I’ve been warned. Now, could I tell you about my idea for the assignment?
TPO 5 Lecture 3 Chemistry
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a chemistry class.
Professor
Okay. I know you all have a lot of questions about this lab assignment that's coming out so ... I'm gonna take a little
time this morning to discuss it. So, you know the assignment has to do with Spectroscopy, right? And your reading should
help you get a good idea of what that's all about. But, let's talk about Spectroscopy a little now just to cover the basics.
What is Spectroscopy? Well, the simplest definition I can give you is that Spectroscopy is the study of the interaction
between matter and light. Now, visible light consists of different colors or wavelengths, which together make up what's
called spectrum, a band of colors, like you see in a rainbow. And all substances, all forms of matter, can be distinguished
according to what wavelength of light they absorb and which ones they reflect. It's like, um, well, every element has, what
we call, its own spectral signature. If we can read that signature, we can identify the element. And that's exactly what
47spectroscopy does.
Now, Laser Spectroscopy, which is the focus of your assignment, works by measuring very precisely what parts of the
spectrum are absorbed by different substances. And it has applications in a lot of different disciplines. And your assignment
will be to choose a discipline that interests you, and devise an experiment.
For example, I'm gonna talk about art. I'm interested in the art and to me it's interesting how spectroscopy is used to
analyze art. Let’s say a museum curator comes to you with a problem. She's come across this painting that appears to be an
original - let's say, a Rembrandt. And she wants to acquire it for her museum. But she's got a problem: she's not absolutely
certain it's an original. So, what do you do? How do you determine whether the painting's authentic?
Okay. Think about the scientific process. You've got the question: Is the painting a Rembrandt? So first, you'll need to
make a list of characteristics the painting would have to have to be a Rembrandt. Then you have to discover whether the
painting in question has those characteristics.
So first of all, you'll need to know the techniques Rembrandt used when he applied paint to canvas - his brushstrokes,
how thickly he applied his paint. So you’d need to work with an art historian who has expert knowledge of Rembrandt's
style. You'd have to know when he created his paintings, um... what pigments he used, in other words, what ingredients he
used to make different colors of paint, ‘cause the ingredients used in paints and binding agents plus burnishes, finishes, what
have you, have changed over time.
Since you're trying to verify if it’s a Rembrandt, the ingredients in the pigment would need to have been used during
Rembrandt's lifetime - in the 17th century. And that's where chemistry comes in. You've got to find out what's in those
pigments, learn their composition, and that requires lab work - detective work really - in a word, Spectroscopy. So, how do
we use Spectroscopy?
Well, we put an infrared microscope - a spectroscope - on tiny tiny bits of paint. And using ultraviolet light we can see
the spectral signature of each component part of the pigment. Then we compare these signatures with those of particular
elements like zinc or lead, to determine what the pigment was made of. So, you can see why this type of analysis requires a
knowledge of the history of pigments, right? How and when they were made? Say we determined a pigment was made with
zinc, for example. We know the spectral signature of zinc. And it matches that of the paint sample. We also know that zinc
wasn't discovered until the 18th century. And since Rembrandt lived during the 17th century, we know he couldn't have
painted it.
Now, Spectroscopy has a very distinct advantage over previous methods of analyzing our works, because it's not
invasive. You don't have to remove big chips of paint to do your analysis, which is what other methods require. All you do is
train the microscope on tiny flecks of paint and analyze them.
Now a word or two about restoration. Sometimes original art works appear questionable or inauthentic because they’ve
had so many restorers add touch-up layers to cover up damage, damage from the paint having deteriorated over time. Well,
spectroscopy can reveal the composition of those touch-up layers too. So we can find out when they were applied. Then if
we want to undo some bad restoration attempts, we can determine what kind of process we can use to remove them to
dissolve the paint and uncover the original.
TPO 5 Lecture 4 Literature
Narrator
48Listen to part of a lecture in a literature class.
Professor
Now we can't really talk about fairy tales without first talking about folktales because there's a strong connection
between these two genres, these two types of stories. In fact, many fairy tales started out as folktales.
So, what's a folktale? How would you characterize them? Jeff?
Jeff:
Well, they are old stories, traditional stories. They were passed down orally within cultures from generation to
generation, so they changed a lot over time. I mean, every storyteller, or, maybe every town, might have had a slightly
different version of the same folktale.
Professor:
That's right. There's local difference. And that's why we say folktales are communal. By communal, we mean they
reflect the traits and the concerns of a particular community at a particular time. So essentially the same tale could be told in
different communities, with certain aspects of the tale adapted to fit the specific community. Um, not the plot, the details of
what happens in the story would remain constant. That was the thread that held the tale together. But all the other elements,
like the location or characters, might be modified for each audience.
Okay. So what about fairy tales? Th…they also are found in most cultures, but how are they different from folktales?
I guess the first question is: what is a fairy tale? And don’t anyone say “a story with a fairy in it” because we all know
that very few fairy tales actually have those tiny magical creatures in them. But, what else can we say about them? Mary.
Mary:
Well, they seem to be less realistic than folktales…like they have something improbable happening - a frog turning into
a prince, say. Oh, that's another common element, royalty - a prince or princess. And fairy tales all seem to take place in a
location that's nowhere and everywhere at the same time.
Professor:
What's the line-up? How do all those stories start? Once upon a time, in a faraway land... oh, in the case of folktales,
each storyteller would specify a particular location and time, though the time and location would differ for different
storytellers.
With fairy tales, however, the location is generally unspecified, no matter who the storyteller is. That land far away...
We'll come back to this point in a few minutes.
Student:
Um... I, I thought that a fairy tale was just a written version of an oral folktale.
Professor:
Well, not exactly, though that is how many fairy tales developed. For example, in the late 18th century, the GrimmBrothers traveled throughout what's now Germany, recording local folktales. These were eventually published as fairy tales,
but not before undergoing a process of evolution.
Now, a number of things happen when an oral tale gets written down.
First, the language changes. It becomes more formal, more standard - some might say, "Less colorful". It's like the
49difference in your language depending on whether you are talking to someone, or writing them a letter.
Second, when an orally transmitted story is written down, an authoritative version with a recognized author is created.
The communal aspect gets lost. The tale no longer belongs to the community. It belongs to the world, so to speak. Because
of this, elements like place and time can no longer be tailored to suit a particular audience. So they become less identifiable,
more generalizable to any audience.
On the other hand, descriptions of characters and settings can be developed more completely. In folktales, characters
might be identified by a name, but you wouldn't know anything more about them. But in fairy tales, people no longer have
to remember plots. They're written down, right? So more energy can be put into other elements of the story like character
and setting. So you get more details about the characters, about where the action takes place, what people's houses were like, ur, whether they're small cabins or grand palaces. And it's worth investing that energy because the story, now in book form,
isn't in danger of being lost. Those details won't be forgotten. If a folktale isn't repeated by each generation, it may be lost
for all time. But with a fairy tale, it's always there in a book, waiting to be discovered, again and again.
Another interesting difference involves the change in audience. Who the stories are meant for? Contrary to what many
people believe today, folktales were originally intended for adults, not for children. So why is it that fairy tales seemtargeted toward children nowadays?

Listen to a conversation between a student and an employee in the university’s career services office.
Student
Hi, do you have a minute?
Employee
Sure, how can I help you?
Student
I have a couple of questions about the career fair next week.
Employee
OK, shoot.
Student
Um ...well, are seniors the only ones who can go? I mean, you know, they are finishing school this year and getting
their degrees and everything. And, well, it seems like businesses would wanna talk to them and not first year students like
me.
Employee
No, no, the career fair is opened to all our students and we encourage anyone who’s interested to go check it out.
Student
50Well, that’s good to know.
Employee
You’ve seen the flyers and posters around campus, I assume.
Student
Sure, can’t miss them. I mean, they all say where and when the fair is, just not who should attend.
Employee
Actually they do, but it’s in the small print. Uh, we should probably make that part easier to reach, shouldn’t we? I’ll
make a note of that right now. So, do you have any other questions?
Student
Yes, actually I do now. Um ...since I’d only be going to familiarize myself with the process, you know, check it out, I
was wondering if there is anything youwould recommend that I do to prepare.
Employee
That’s actually a very good question. Well, as you know, the career fair is generally an opportunity for local businesses
to recruit new employees, and for soon-to-be graduates to have interviews with several companies they might be interested
in working for. Now, in your case, even though you wouldn’t be looking for employment right now, it still wouldn’t hurt for
you to prepare much like you would if you were looking for a job.
Student
You mean, like get my resume together and wear a suit?
Employee
That’s a given. I was thinking more along the lines of doing some research. The flyers and posters list all the businesses
that are sending representatives to the career fair. Um ...what’s your major or do you to have one yet?
Student
Well, I haven’t declared a major yet, but I’m strongly considering accounting. See, that’s part of the reason I wanna go
to the fair, to help me decide if that’s what I really want to study.
Employee
That’s very wise. Well, I suggest that you get on the computer and learn more about the accounting companies in
particular that would be attending. You can learn a lot about companies from their internet websites. Then prepare a list of
questions.
Student
Questions, hmm… so, in a way, I’ll be interviewing them?
Employee
That’s one way of looking at it. Think about it for a second. What do you want to know about working for an
accounting firm?
Student
Well, there is the job itself, and salary of course, and working conditions, I mean, would I have an office, or would I
work in a big room with a zillion other employees, and…and maybe about opportunities for advancement.
51Employee
See? Those’re all important things to know. After you do some research, you’ll be able to tailor your questions to the
particular company you are talking to.
Student
Wow, I’m glad I came by here. So, it looks like I’ve got some work to do.
Employee
And if you plan on attending future career fairs, I recommend you sign up for one of our interview workshops.
Student
I’ll do that.
TPO 6 Lecture 1 Economics
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an economics class.
Professor
Now when I mention the terms “boom and bust”, what does that bring to mind?
Student
The dot-com crash of the ‘90s.
Professor
Ok. The boom in the late 1990s when all those new Internet companies sprang up and were then sold for huge amounts
of money. Then the bust around 2000…2001 when many of those same Internet companies went out of business. Of course,
booms aren’t always followed by busts. We’ve certainly seen times when local economies expanded rapidly for a while and
then went back to a normal pace of growth.
But, there’s a type of rapid expansion, what might be called a hysterical or irrational boom that pretty much always
leads to a bust. See, people often create and intensify a boom when they get carried away by some new industry that seems
like it will make them lots of money fast. You’d think that by the 90s, people would have learned from the past. If they did,
well, look at tulips.
Student
Tulips? You mean like the flower?
Professor
Exactly. For instance, do you have any idea where tulips are from? Originally I mean.
Student
Well, the Netherlands, right?
Professor
That’s what most people think, but no. They are not native to the Netherlands, or even Europe. Tulips actually hail
from an area that Chinese call the Celestial Mountains in Central Asia. A very remote mountainous region. It was Turkish
nomads who first discovered tulips and spread them slowly westward.
52Now, around the 16th century, Europeans were traveling to Istanbul and Turkey as merchants and diplomats. And the
Turks often gave the Europeans tulip bulbs as gifts which they would carry home with them. For the Europeans, tulips were
totally unheard of. Er…a great novelty. The first bulb to show up in the Netherlands, the merchant who received themroasted and ate them! He thought they were kind of onion.
It turns out that the Netherlands was an ideal country for growing tulips. It had the right kind of sandy soil for one
thing, but also, it was a wealthy nation with a growing economy, willing to spend lots of money on new exotic things. Plus,
the Dutch had a history of gardening. Wealthy people would compete, spending enormous amounts of money to buy the
rarest flowers for their gardens. Soon tulips were beginning to show up in different colors as growers tried to breed themspecifically for colors which would make them even more valuable. But they were never completely sure what they would
get. Some of the most prized tulips were white with purple streaks, or red with yellow streaks on the petals, even a dark
purple tulip that was very much prized.
What happened then was a craze for these specialized tulips. We called that craze “tulip mania”. So, here we’ve got all
the conditions for an irrational boom: a prospering economy, so more people had more disposable income-money to spend
on luxuries, but they weren’t experienced at investing their new wealth. Then along comes a thrilling new commodity. Sure
the first specimens were just plain old red tulips, but they could be bred into some extraordinary variations, like the dark
purple tulip. And finally, you have an unregulated market place, no government constraints, where prices could explode.
And explode they did, starting in the 1630s.
There was always much more demand for tulips than supply. Tulips didn’t bloom frequently like roses. Tulips bloomed
once in the early spring. And that was it for the year. Eventually, specially-bred multicolored tulips became so valuable, well,
according to records, one tulip bulb was worth 24 tons of wheat, or a thousand pounds of cheese. One particular tulip bulb
was sold and exchanged for a small ship. In other words, tulips were literally worth their weight in gold.
As demand grew, people began selling promissory notes guaranteeing the future delivery of prized tulip bulbs. The
buyers of these pieces of paper would resell the notes at marked up prices. These promissory notes kept changing hands
from buyer to buyer until the tulip was ready for delivery. But it was all pure speculation because as I said, there was no
way to know if the bulb was really going to produce the variety, the color that was promised. But that didn’t matter to the
owner of the note. The owner only cared about having that piece of paper so it could be traded later at a profit. And people
were borrowing, mortgaging their homes in many cases to obtain those bits of paper because they were sure they found an
easy way to make money.
So now, you’ve got all the ingredients for a huge bust. And bust it did, when one cold February morning in 1637, a
group of bulb traders got together and discovered that suddenly there were no bidders. Nobody wanted to buy. Panic spread
like wild fire and the tulip market collapsed totally.
TPO 6 Lecture 2 Biology
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a biology class.
Professor
Ok, I have an interesting plant species to discuss with you today. Uh…it’s a species of a very rare tree that grows in
Australia, Eidothea hardeniana, but it’s better known as the Nightcap Oak.
Now, it was discovered only very recently, just a few years ago. Um… it remained hidden for so long because it’s so
53rare. There are only about 200 of them in existence. They grow in a rain forest, in a mountain rage…range in the north part
of New South Wales which is uh… a state in Australia. So just 200 individual trees in all.
Now another interesting thing about the Nightcap Oak is that it is…it represents…uh…a very old type…uh…kind of
tree that grew a hundred million years ago. Um, we found fossils that old that bear remarkable resemblance to the tree. So,
it’s a primitive tree. A…a living fossil you might say. It’s relic from earlier times and it has survived all these years without
much change. And it…it’s probably a kind of tree from which other trees that grow in Australia today evolved.
Just to give you an idea of what we are talking about. Here’s a picture of the leaves of the tree and its flowers. I don’t
know how well you can see the flowers. They’re those little clusters sitting at the base of the leaves.
Okay, what have we tried to find out about the tree since we’ve discovered it? Hmm…or how…why is…is it so rare?
It’s one of the first questions. Um… how is it…um…how does it reproduce? It’s another question. Um, maybe those two
questions are actually related. Jim?
Student
Hmm …I don’t know. But I can imagine that…for instance, seed dispersal might be a factor. I mean if the…er…you
know, if the seeds cannot really disperse in the wild area, then, you know, the tree may not colonize new areas. It can’t
spread from the area where it’s growing.
Professor
Right. That’s…that’s actually a very good answer. Uh, of course, you might think there might not be many areas where
the tree could spread into, er…because…um…well, it’s very specialized in terms of the habitat. But, that’s not really the
case here. Um…the suitable habitat, that is, the actual rainforest is much larger than the few hectares where the Nightcap
Oak grows.
Now this tree is a flowering tree as I showed you. Um…um…it produces a fruit, much like a plum. On the inci…inside
there’s a seed with a hard shell. It…it appears that the shell has to crack open or break down somewhat to allow the seed to
soak up water. You know, if the Nightcap Oak remains…if their seeds remain locked inside their shell, they will not
germinate. Actually, the seeds…er…they don’t retain the power to germinate for very long, maybe two years. So there’s
actually quite a short window of opportunity for the seed to germinate. So the shell somehow has to be broken down before
this…um…germination ability expires. And…and then there’s a kind of rat that likes to feed on the seeds as well. So, given
all these limitations, not many seeds that the tree produces will actually germinate. So this is a possible explanation for why
the tree does not spread. It doesn’t necessarily explain how it became so rare, but it explains why it doesn’t increase.
OK, so it seems to be the case that the species, this Nightcap Oak is not very good at spreading. However, it seems,
though we can’t be sure, that it’s very good at persisting as a population. Um…we…there’s some indications to suggest that
the population of the Nightcap Oak has not declined over the last. er…you know, many hundreds of years. So it’s stayed
quite stable. It’s not a remnant of some huge population that is dwindled in the last few hundred years for some reason. It’s
not necessarily a species in retreat. Ok, so it cannot spread very well, but it’s good at maintaining itself. It’s rare, but it’s not
disappearing.
Ok, the next thing we might want to ask about a plant like that is what chances does it have to survive into the future.
Let’s look at that.
TPO 6 Conversation 2

54Listen to a conversation between a student and a professor.
Student
Professor Martin?
Professor
Uh, hi, Lisa, what can I do for you?
Student
Well, I’ve been thinking about, you know, what you were saying in class last week, about how we shouldn’t wait until
the last minute to find an idea and get started working on our term paper
.Professor
Good, good, and have you come up with anything?
Student
Well, yeah, sort of. See, I’ve never had a linguistics class before, so I was sort of, I mean, I was looking over the course
description and a lot of the stuff you described there, I just don’t know what it is talking about, you know, or what it means.
But there was one thing that really did jump out at me.
Professor
Yes?
Student
The section on dialects, ‘cause…like, that’s the kind of thing that’s always sort of intrigued me, you know?
Professor
Well, that’s certainly an interesting topic. But you may not realize, I mean, the scope...
Student
Well, especially now, ‘cause I’ve got like one roommate who is from the south and another one from New York. And
we all talk like totally different, you know
Professor
Yes, I understand. But…
Student
But then I was noticing, like, we don’t really get into this till the end of the semester, you know. So I…
Professor
So, you want some pointers where to go for information on the subject? Well, you could always start by reading the
chapter in the book on sociolinguistics. That will give you a basic understanding of the key issues involved here.
Student
Yeah, that’s what I thought. So I started reading the chapter, you know, about how everyone speaks some dialect of a
language. And I’m wondering like, well, how do we even manage to understand each other at all?
Professor
Ah, yes, an interesting question. You see…
55Student
So then I read the part about dialect accommodation. You know, the idea that people tend to adapt their speaking to
make it closer to the speech of whomever they’re talking to, and I’m thinking, yeah, I do that when I talk with my
roommates, and without even thinking about it or anything, you know.
Professor
OK, all right. Dialect accommodation is a more manageable sort of topic.
Student
So I was thinking like, I wonder just how much other people do the same thing. I mean, there are students here from all
over the place. Does everyone change the way they talk to some degree depending on whom they are talking to?
Professor
You’d be surprised.
Student
So, anyway, my question is, do you think it’d be OK if I did a project like that for my term paper? You know, find
students from different parts of the country, record them talking to each other in different combinations, report on how they
accommodate their speech or not, that kind of thing?
Professor
Tell you what, Lisa, write me up a short proposal for this project, how you’re going to carry out the experiment and
everything, a design plan. And I think this’ll work out just fine.
TPO 6 Lecture 3 Creative Writing
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a creative writing class.
Professor
Alright everybody, the topic for today is, well, we’re gonna take a look at how to start creating the characters for the
stories you’re writing. One way of doing that is to come up with what’s called “a character sketch”, I don’t mean a sketch
like a drawing, I guess that’s obvious. It’s um…it’s a…a sketch is a way of getting started on defining your characters’
personalities.
To begin, how do we create fictional characters? We don’t just pull them from thin air, do we? I mean we don’t create
them out of nothing. We base them, consciously or unconsciously, we base them on real people, or we blend several
people’s traits, their attributes into one character. But when people think fiction, they may assume the characters come fromthe author’s imagination. But the writer’s imagination is influenced by… by real people, could be anyone, so, pay attention
to the people you meet, someone in class, at the gym, that guy who is always sitting in the corner at the coffee house, um…your cousin, who’s always getting into dangerous situations. We’re pulling from reality, gathering bits and pieces of real
people. You use these people, and the bits of behavior or characteristics as a starting point as you begin to sketch out your
characters.
Here is what you should think about doing first. When you begin to formulate a story, make a list of interesting people
you know or have observed. Consider why they’re unique or annoying. Then make notes about their unusual or dominant
attributes. As you create fictional characters, you’ll almost always combine characteristics from several different people on
56your list to form the identity and personality of just one character. Keeping this kind of character sketch can help you
solidify your character’s personality, so that it remains consistent throughout your story.
You need to define your characters, know their personalities so that you can have them acting in ways that are
predictable, consistent with their personalities. Get to know them like a friend, you know your friends well enough to know
how they’ll act in certain situations, right? Say you have three friends, their car runs out of gas on the highway. John gets
upset. Mary remains calm. Teresa takes charge of handling the situation. And let’s say, both John and Mary defer to her
leadership. They call you to explain what happen. And when John tells you he got mad, you’re not surprised, because he
always gets frustrated when things go wrong. Then he tells you how Teresa took charge, calmed him down, assigned tasks
for each person and got them on their way. Again, you’re not surprised. It’s exactly what you’d expect. Well, you need to
know your characters, like you know your friends. If you know a lot about a person’s character, it’s easy to predict how
they’ll behave. So if your characters’ personalities are well defined, it will be easy for you as the writer to portray themrealistically…er… believably, in any given situation.
While writing character sketches, do think about details. Ask yourself questions, even if you don’t use the details in
your story, um…what does each character like to eat, what setting does each prefer, the mountains, the city, what about
educational background, their reactions to success or defeat, write it all down.
But, here I need to warn you about a possible pitfall. Don’t make your character into a stereotype. Remember the
reader needs to know how your character is different from other people who might fall in the same category. Maybe your
character loves the mountains and has lived in a remote area for years. To make sure he is not a stereotype, ask yourself how
he sees life differently from other people who live in that kind of setting. Be careful not to make him into the cliché of the
“ragged mountain dweller”.
Okay, now, I’ll throw out a little terminology. It’s easy stuff. Major characters are sometimes called “round characters”.
Minor characters are sometimes called, well, just the opposite, “flat”. A round character is fully developed; a flat character
isn’t, character development is fairly limited. The flat character tends to serve mainly as a motivating factor. For instance,
you introduce a flat character who has experienced some sort of defeat. And then your round, your main character who
loves success and loves to show off, comes and boasts about succeeding and jokes about the flat character’s defeat in front
of others, humiliates the other guy. The flat character is introduced solely for the purpose of allowing the round character to
show off.
TPO 6 Lecture 4 Earth Science
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an earth science class.
Professor
We’re really just now beginning to understand how quickly drastic climate change can take place. We can see past
occurrences of climate change that took place over just a few hundred years.
Take uh… the Sahara Desert in Northern Africa. The Sahara was really different 6,000 years ago. I mean, you wouldn’t
call it a tropical paradise or anything, uh…or maybe you would if you think about how today in some parts of the Sahara
it…it only rains about once a century. Um… but basically, you had greenery and you had water.
And what I find particularly interesting... amazing really, what really indicates how undesert-like the Sahara was
thousands of years ago, was something painted on the rock, prehistoric art, hippopotamuses, as you know hippos need a lot
57of water and hence? Hence what?
Student
They need to live near a large source of water year around.
Professor
That’s right.
Student
But how is that proof that the Sahara used to be a lot wetter? I mean the people who painted those hippos, well,
couldn’t they have seen them on their travels?
Professor
Okay, in principle they could, Karl. But the rock paintings aren’t the only evidence. Beneath the Sahara are huge
aquifers, basically a sea of fresh water, that’s perhaps a million years old filtered through rock layers. And…er…and then
there is fossilized pollen, from low shrubs and grasses that once grew in the Sahara. In fact these plants still grow, er…but
hundreds of miles away, in more vegetated areas. Anyway, it’s this fossilized pollen along with the aquifers and the rock
paintings, these three things are all evidence that the Sahara was once much greener than it is today, that there were hippos
and probably elephants and giraffes and so on.
Student
So what happened?
Professor
How did it happen? Well, Now, we’re so used to hearing about how human activities are affecting the climate, right?
But that takes the focus away from the natural variations in the earth climate, like the Ice Age, right? The planet was
practically covered in ice just a few thousand years ago. Now as far as the Sahara goes, there is some recent literature that
points to the migration of the monsoon in that area
Students
Huh?????
Professor
What do I mean? Okay, a monsoon is a seasonal wind that can bring in a large amount of rainfall. Now if the monsoon
migrates, well, that means that the rains move to another area, right?
So what caused the monsoon to migrate? Well, the answer is: the dynamics of earth’s motions, the same thing that
caused the Ice Age by the way. The earth’s not always the same distance from the sun, and it’s not always tilting toward the
sun at the same angle. There are slight variations in these two parameters. They’re gradual variations but their effects can be
pretty abrupt. And can cause the climate to change in just a few hundred years.
Student
That’s abrupt?
Professor
Well, yeah, considering that other climate shifts take thousands of years, this one is pretty abrupt. So these changes in
the planet’s motions, they caused the climate to change.
But it was also compounded. What the Sahara experienced was uh…a sort of “runaway drying effect”. As I said the
58monsoon migrated itself, so there was less rain in the Sahara. The land started to get drier, which in turn caused a huge
decrease in the amount of vegetation, because vegetation doesn’t grow as well in dry soil, right? And then, less vegetation
means the soil can’t hold water as well, the soil loses its ability to retain water when it does rain. So then you have less
moisture to help clouds form, nothing to evaporate for cloud formation. And then the cycle continues, less rain, drier soil,
less vegetation, fewer clouds, less rain etc. etc..
Student
But, what about the people who made the rock paintings?
Professor
Good question. No one really knows. But there might be some connections to ancient Egypt. At about the same time
that the Sahara was becoming a desert…hmm ...5,000 years ago, Egypt really began to flourish out in the Nile River valley.
And that’s not that far away. So it’s only logical to hypothesize that a lot of these people migrated to the Nile valley when
they realized that this was more than a temporary drought. And some people take this a step further. And that’s okay, that’s
science and they hypothesize that this migration actually provided an important impetus in the development of ancient
Egypt. Well, we’ll stay tuned on that.

Eric: No, I'm sorry. Actually it was my computer that lost it, the first draft of it. And, well, anyway, I finally put it in
your mailbox yesterday.

Eric: Well, sorry again. Say, I can send it to you by email too if you like.
Pro: Great. I'll be interested to see how it all came out.
Eric: Right. Now, um, I just have overheard some graduate students’ talking, something about a party for Dean Adams?
Pro: Retirement party, yes, all students are invited. Wasn't there notice on the Anthropology Department's bulletin
board?
Eric: Uh, I don't know. But I want to offer help out with it. You know whatever you need. Dean Adams, well, I took a
few anthropology classes with her and they were great, inspiring. That's why I want to pitch in.
59Pro: Oh, that's very thoughtful of you, Eric, but it will be pretty low-key, nothing flashy. That's not her style.
Eric: So there's nothing?
Pro: No, we'll have coffee and cookies, maybe a cake. But actually a couple of the administrative assistants are
working on that. You could ask them but I think they've got covered.
Eric: Ok.
Pro: Actually, oh, no, never mind.
Eric: What's it?
Pro: Well, it's nothing to do with the party and I'm sure there are more exciting ways that you could spend your time.
But we do need some help with something. We’re compiling a database of articles the anthropology faculty has published.
There is not much glory in it, but we are looking for someone with some knowledge of anthropology who can enter the
articles. I hesitate to mention it. But I don't suppose this is something you would...
Eric: No, that sounds kind of cool. I would like to see what they are writing about.
Pro: Wonderful. And there are also some unpublished studies. Did you know Dean Adams did a lot of field research in
Indonesia? Most of it hasn’t been published yet.
Eric: No, like what?
Pro: Well, she is really versatile. She just spent several months studying social interactions in Indonesia and she's been
influential in ethnology. Oh, and she's also done work in south of America, this is closer to biology, especially with
speciation.
Eric: uh, not to seem uninformed...
Pro: Well, how species form. You know, how two distinct species form from one. Like when populations of the same
species are isolated from each other and then develop into two different directions and end up as two distinct species.
Eric: Interesting.
Pro: Yes, and while she was there in South America, she collected a lot of linguistic information and songs, really
fascinating.
Eric: Well. I hate to see her leave.
Pro: Don't worry. She'll still be around. She's got lots of projects that she's still in the middle of.

Listen to part of a lecture in a class on theater history. The professor is discussing the theater of 19th-century France.
Pro: The 19th century was the time that saw what we called Realism developed in the European theater. Um… to
understand this though, we first need to look at an earlier form of drama known as the well-made play, which basically was
a pattern for constructing plays, plays that... uh.. beginning with some early 19th century comedies in France proved very
successful commercially.
The dramatic devices used here weren’t actually anything new. They had been around for centuries. But the formula for
a well-made play required that the certain of these elements be included in a particular order. And most importantly, that
everything in the plays be logically connected. In fact, some of these playwrights would start by writing the end of a play
and work backward toward the beginning, just to make sure each event led logically from what had gone before.
Ok, so what are the necessary elements of a well-made play?
Well, the first is logical exposition. Exposition is whatever background information you have to reveal to the audience.
So, they‘ll understand what is going on. Before this time, exposition might have come from actors simply giving speeches.
Someone might walk out on a stage and say: “In fair Verona where we lay our scene!” and then tell all about the feuding
families of Romeo and Juliet. But for the well-made play, even the exposition had to be logical, believable. So, for example,
you might have two servants gossiping as they are cleaning the house. And one says, Oh, what a shame the master’s son is
still not married. And the other might mention a rumor about a mysterious gentleman who’s just moved into town with his
beautiful daughter. These comments are part of the play’s logical exposition.
The next key element of the a well-made play is referred to as the inciting incident. After we have the background
information, we need a key moment that gets things moving, that really makes the audience interested in what happens to
the characters we just heard about. So, for example, after the two servants reveal all this background information, we meet
the young man. Just as he first lays eyes on the beautiful young woman, and immediately falls in love. This is the inciting
incident. It sets off, the plot of the play.
Now, the plot of a well-made play is usually driven by secrets. Things that the audience knows, but the characters often
don’t know. So, for example, the audience learns through a letter or through someone else’s conversation who this
mysterious gentleman is and why he left the town many years before. But the young man doesn’t know about this. And the
woman doesn’t understand the ancient connection between her family and his.
And before the secrets are revealed to the main characters, the plot of the play proceeds as a series of sort of up and
down moments. For example, the woman first appears not to even notice the young man, and it seems to him like the end of
the world. But then, he learns that she actually wants to meet him too. So, life is wonderful. Then, if he tries to talk with her,
maybe her father get furious, for no apparent reason. So, they can’t see each other. But, just as the young man has almost
lost all hope, he finds out, well you get the idea, the reversals of fortune continue, increasing the audience’s tension and
excitement, making them wonder if everything is going to come out okay or not.
Next comesan element known as the: obligatory scene. It’s a scene, a moment in which all the secrets are revealed.
And generally, things turn out well for the hero and others we care about, a happy ending of some sort. This became so
popular that a playwright almost had to include it in every play, which is why it’s called: the obligatory scene.
And that’s followed by the final dramatic element---the denouement or the resolution, when all the loose ends have to
61be tied up in a logical way. Remember, the obligatory scene gives the audience emotional pleasure. But the denouement
offers the audience a logical conclusion. That’s the subtle distinction we need to try very hard to keep in mind.
So, as I said, the well-made play, this form of playwriting, became the basis for realism in drama, and for a lot of very
popular 19th-century plays. And also, a pattern we find in the plots of many later plays and even movies that we see today.
TPO 7 Lecture 2 Biology
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a Biology class.
Pro: So, that is how elephants use infrasound. Now, let’s talk about the other end of the acoustical spectrum, sound that
is too high for humans to hear---ultrasound.
Ultrasound is used by many animals that detect and some of them send out very high frequency sounds. So, what is a
good example? Yes? Carol.
Carol: Well, bats, since they are all blind, bats have to use sound for, you know, to keep from flying into things.
Pro: That is echolocation. Echolocation is pretty self-explanatory; using echoes reflected sound waves to locate things.
As Carol said, bats use it for navigation and orientation. And what else? Mike.
Mike: Well, finding food is always important, and I guess not becoming food for other animals.
Pro: Right, on both counts. Avoiding other predators, and locating prey, typically insects that fly around at night. Now
before I go on, let me just respond to something Carol was saying--- this idea that bats are blind. Actually, there are some
species of bats, the ones that don’t use echolocation that do rely on their vision for navigation, but it is true that for many
bats, their vision is too weak to count on.
Ok, so quick summary of how echolocation works. The bat emits these ultrasonic pulses, very high pitch sound waves
that we cannot hear. And then, they analyze the echoes, how the waves bounce back. Here, let me finish this diagram I
started before class. So the bat sends out these pulses, very focused bursts of sound, and echoes bounce back. You know, I
don’t think I need to draw on the echoes, your reading assignment for the next class; it has a diagram that shows this very
clearly.
So, anyway, as I were saying, by analyzing these echoes, the bat can determine, say, if there is wall in a cave that it
needs to avoid, and how far away it is. Another thing it uses ultrasound to detect is the size and shape of objects. For
example, one echo they quickly identify is the one they associate with a moth, which is common prey for a bat, particularly
a moth beating its wings. However, moth happened to have a major advantage over most other insects. They can detect
ultrasound; this means that when a bat approaches, the moth can detect the bat’s presence. So, it has time to escape to safety,
or else they can just remain motionless. Since, when they stop beating their wings, they’d be much harder for the bat to
distinguish from, oh… a leaf or some other object.
Now, we have tended to underestimate just how sophisticated the abilities of animals that use ultrasound are. In fact,
we kind of assumed that they were filtering a lot out, the way a sophisticated radar system can ignore echoes from stationary
objects on the ground. Radar does this to remove ground clutter, information about hills or buildings that it doesn’t need.
But bats, we thought they were filtering out this kind of information, because they simply couldn’t analyze it. But, it looks
as if we were wrong. Recently there was this experiment with trees and a specific species of bats. A bat called: the lesser
62spearnosed bat.
Now, a tree should be a huge acoustical challenge for a bat, right? I mean it’s got all kinds of surfaces with different
shapes and angles. So, well, the echoes from a tree are going to a mass of chaotic acoustic reflections, right, not like the
echo from a moth. So, we thought for a long time that bats stop their evaluation at simply that is a tree. Yet, it turns out that
bats or at least this particular species, cannot only tell that is a tree, but can also distinguish between, say, a pine tree, and a
deciduous tree, like a maple or oak tree, just by their leaves. And when I say, leaves, I mean pine needles too. Any ideas on
how it would know that?
Stu: Well, like with the moth, could it be their shape?
Pro: You are on the right track---it is actually the echo of all the leaves as whole that matters. Now, think, a pine tree
with all those little densely packed needles. Those produce a large number of faint reflections in what’s... what’s called a ...
a smooth echo. The wave form is very even, but an oak which has fewer but bigger leaves with stronger reflections,
produces a jagged wave form, or what we called: a rough echo. And these bats can distinguish between the two, and not just
with trees, but with any echo that comes in a smooth or rough shape.
TPO 7 Conversation
Narrator
Listen to a conversation between a student and a librarian.
Stu: Hi, I am new here and I couldn't come to the student orientation and I'm wondering if you can give me a few quick
pointers about the library? I’d really appreciate it.
Pro: Sure. I’d be glad to. What's your major area of study?
Stu: Latin American Literature.
Pro: OK. Well, over here's the section where we have language, literature and the arts. And if you go downstairs you
will find the history section. Generally, the students who concentrate in Latin American literature find themselves
researching in the history section a lot.
Stu: Um-hmm, you are right. I am a transfer student and I've already done a year at another university so I know how
the research can go. I spent a lot of time in the history section. So how long can I borrow books for?
Pro: Our loan period is a month. Oh I should also mention that we have an inter-library loan service. If you need to get
hold a book that’s not in our library, there is a truck that runs between our library and a few other public and university
libraries in this area. It comes around three times a week.
Stu: Hey, that's great! At my last school, it could take a really long time to get the materials I needed. So when I had a
project, I had to make a plan way in advance. This sounds much faster. Another thing I was wondering is: is there a place
where I can bring my computer and hook it up?
Pro: Sure. There is a whole area here on the main floor where you can bring a laptop and plug it in for power but on top
of that we also have a connection for the internet at every seat.
Stu: Nice, so I can do the all research I need to do right here in the library. I’ll have all the resources, all the books and
63the information I need right here in one place.
Pro: Yeah. That's the idea. I am sure you'll need photocopiers too. There are down the hall to your left. We have a
system where you have to use a copy card so you'll need to buy a card from the front desk. You insert it into the machine
and you are ready to make copies.
Stu: How much do you guys get charge?
Pro: Seven cents a copy.
Stu: Oh, that is not too bad. Thanks. Um, where is the collection of rare books?
Pro: Rare books are up on the second floor. They are in a separate room where the temperature is controlled, to
preserve the old paper in them. You need to get special permission to access them, and then you have to wear gloves to
handle them ‘cause the oils in our hands, you know, can destroy the paper. And gloves prevent that so we have a basket of
gloves in the room.
Stu: Ok. Thanks. I suppose that’s all I need to know. You've been very helpful. Thanks.
Pro: Anytime. Bye
Stu: Bye.
TPO 7 Lecture 3 Anthropology
Pro: So we've been discussing 16th century Native American life, and today we're going to focus on the Iroquois and
Huron peoples. They lived in the northeastern great lakes region of North America. Now, back then, their lifes depended on
the natural resources of the forests, especially the birch tree. The birch tree can grow in many different types of soils and is
prevalent in that area. Now can anyone here describe a birch tree?
Stu: They are tall and white, the bark, I mean.
Pro: Yes. The birch tree has white bark, and this tough protective outer layer of the tree, this white bark, is waterproof.
And this waterproof quality of the bark, it made it useful for making things like cooking containers, a variety of utensils.
And if you peel birch bark in the winter, we call it “the winter bark”, another layer, a tougher inner layer of the tree adheres
to the bark, producing a stronger material. So the winter bark was used for larger utensils and containers.
Stu: I know people make utensils out of wood, but utensils out of tree bark?
Pro: Well, birch bark is pliable and very easy to bend. The Native Americans would cut the bark and fold it into any
shape they needed, then secure it with cords until it dried. They could fold the bark into many shapes.
Stu: So if they cooked in bowls made of birch bark, wouldn't that make the food taste funny?
Pro: Oh, that's one of the great things about birch bark. The taste of the birch tree doesn't get transferred to the food. So
it was perfect for cooking containers.
64But the most important use of the bark, by far, was the canoe. Since the northeast region of North American is
interconnected by many streams and waterways, water transportation by vessels like a canoe was most essential. The paths
through the woods were often overgrown, so water travel was much faster. And here's what the Native Americans did. They
would peel large sheets of bark from the tree to form lightweight yet sturdy canoes. The bark was stretched over frames
made from tree branches, stitched together and sealed with resin. You know that sticky liquid that comes out of the tree?
And when it dries, it's watertight.
One great thing about these birch bark canoes was, uh, they could carry a large amount of cargo. For example, a canoe
weighing about 50 pounds could carry up to nine people and 250 pounds of cargo.
Stu: Wow! But how far could they travel that way?
Pro: Well like I said, the northeastern region is interconnected by rivers and streams and the ocean at the coast. The
canoes allow them to travel over a vast area that today would take a few hours to fly over. You see, the Native Americans
made canoes of all types, for travel on small streams or on large open ocean waters. For small streams, they made narrow,
maneuverable boats, while, while larger canoes were needed for the ocean. They could travel throughout the area only
occasionally having to portage, to carry the canoe over a land short distance to another nearby stream. And since the canoes
were so light, this wasn't a difficult task.
Now how do you think this affected their lives?
Stu: Well if they could travel so easily over such a large area, they could trade with people from other areas which I
guess would lead them to form alliances?
Pro: Exactly. Having an efficient means of transportation, well, that helps the Iroquois to form a federation linked by
natural waterways. And this federation expanded from what is now Southern Canada all the way south to the Dalever River.
And this efficiency of the birch bark canoe also made an impression on newcomers to the area. French traders in the 17th
century modeled their...well they adopted the design of the Iroquois birch bark canoes, and they found they could travel
great distances more than 15 kilometers a month.
Now besides the bark, Native Americans also used the wood of the birch tree. The young trees were used as supports
for lodgings, with the waterproof bark used as roofing. Branches were folded into snowshoes. And the Native American
people were all adept at running very fast over the snow in these birch branch snowshoes, which if you ever tried walking in
snowshoes you know it wasn't easy.
TPO 7 Lecture 4 Geology
Last time, we started to talk about glaciers and how these masses of ice form from crystallized snow, and some of you
were amazed at how huge some of these glaciers are. Now, even though it may be difficult to understand how a huge mass
of ice can move or flow, it’s another word for it, it’s really known that no secret that the glaciers flow because of gravity.
But how they flow, the way they flow, needs some explaining.
Now, the first type of glacier flow is called: basal slip. Basal slip or sliding as it’s often called, basically refers to the
slipping or sliding of a glacier across bedrock, actually across a thin layer of water on top of the bedrock. So, this process
shouldn’t be too hard to imagine. What happens is that the ice at the base of the glacier is under a great deal of pressure-- the
pressure coming from the weight of the overlying ice. And you probably know that under pressure, the melting temperature
of water, of the ice I mean, is reduced. So, ice at the base of the glacier melts, even though it’s below zero degree Celsius.
And this results in a thin layer of water between the glacier and the ground. This layer of water reduces friction is... is like a
65lubricant. And it allows the glacier to slide or slip over the bedrock. OK?
Now the next type of movement we will talk about is called: deformation. You’v already known that ice is brittle, if
you hit it with a hammer, it will shatter like glass. But ice is also plastic, it can change shape without breaking. If you leave,
for example, a bar of ice supported only at one end, the end, the unsupported end will deform under its own weight, it’ll
kind of flatten out at one end, get distorted, deformed. Think of deformation as a very slow oozing. Depending on the
stresses on the glacier, the ice crystal within it reorganize. And during this re-organization the ice crystals realign in a way
that allows them to slide pass each other. And so the glacier oozes downhill without any ice actually melting.
Now, there are a couple of factors that affect the amount of deformation that takes place or the speed of the glacier’s
movement for example. Deformation is more likely to occur the thicker the ice is, because of the gravity of the weight of the
ice. And temperature also plays a part here, in that cold ice does not move as easily as ice that is close to the melting point,
in fact, it is not too different from… the way oil is, thicker at lower temperatures. So, if you have a glacier in a slightly
warmer region, it will flow faster than a glacier in a cooler region.
Ok, um… Now, I’d like to touch briefly on extension and compression. Your textbook includes these as types, as a
particular type of glacier movement, but you will see that there are …as many textbooks that omit it as a type of movement
as include it. And I might not include it right now, if it weren’t in your textbook. But, basically, the upper parts of glaciers
have less pressure on them. So, they don’t deform easily, they tend to be more brittle. And crevasses can form in this upper
layers of the glacier. When the glacier comes into contact with bedrock walls or is otherwise under some kind of stress, but
can’t deform quickly enough. So, the ice would expand or constrict, and that can cause big fissures big cracks to form in the
surface layers of the ice, and that brittle surface ice moving is sometimes considered a type of glacier movement depending
on which source you are consulting.
Now, as you probably know, glaciers generally move really slowly. But sometimes, they experience surges, and during
these surges, in some places, they can move at speeds as high as 7000 meters per year. Now, speeds like that are pretty
unusual, hundreds of times faster than the regular movement of glaciers, but you can actually see glacier move during these
surges, though it is rare.

Conversation 1
Narrator
Listen to a conversation between a student and a registrar.
Stu: Hi, I’d like to drop off my graduation form; I understand you need this in order to process my diploma.
Pro: Ok, I will take that. Before you leave, let's me check our computer. Looks like you are OK for graduation, and
actually, I am getting a warning flag on your academic record here.
Stu: Really?
Pro: Yeah. Let's see what’s what. Are you familiar with our graduation requirements?
Stu: Uh, I think so
66Pro: Well, then you know you need 48 credits in your major field to graduate and at least 24 credits at the intermediate
level or higher. Also, after your second year, you have to meet with your department chair to outline a plan for the rest of
your time here. In the past, we also issue letters before students’ final year began to let them know what they needed to take
in the final year to be OK, but we don't do that anymore.
Stu: I definitely met with my chair person 2 years ago. He told me that I needed 8 more courses at the intermediate
level or higher in the last 2 years to be OK. So I am not sure what the problem is, I make sure I got those credits.
Pro: Unfortunately, the computer is usually pretty reliable. So I am not sure what’s going on here.
Stu: It could be that I have taken 2 basic courses but coupled both of them with, uh, field experiences.
Pro: What do you mean?
Stu: Well, I could only take intro courses because there were no intermediate level courses available for those particular
topics. My chair person told me that if I did independent field research in addition to the assigned work in each course; they
would count as intermediate level courses. My classmates, um, some of my classmates, did this for an easy way to meet
their intermediate course requirement, but I did it to get the kind of depth in those topics I was going for. As it turned out I
really enjoyed the field work, it was a nice supplement to just sitting and listening to lectures
Pro: I am sure that’s true, but the computer is still showing them as basic level courses despite the field work.
Stu: I am not sure what to do then, I mean, should I cancel my graduation party?
Pro: No, no reason to get worried like that, just contact your chair person immediately, ok, tell him to call me as soon
as possible so that we can verify your field work arrangement and certify those credits right away. It’s not like there is an
actual deadline to date or anything. But if more than a few weeks go by, we might have a real problem that would very
difficult to fix in time for you to graduate. In fact, there probably would be nothing we could do.
Stu: I will get on that.
TPO 8 Lecture 1 Animal Behavior
Pro: OK. Well, last time we talked about passive habitat selection, like plants for example, they don't make active
choices about where to grow. They are dispersed by some other agent, like the wind. And if the seeds land in a suitable
habitat, they do well and reproduce.
With active habitat selection, an organism is able to physically select where to live and breed. And because an animal’s
breeding habitat is so important, we’d expect animal species to have developed preferences for particular types of habitats,
places where their offspring have the best chance of survival. So let's look at the effect this preference can have by looking
at some examples.
But first let’s recap. What do we mean by habitat? Frank?
Stu: Well, it’s basically the place or environment where an organism normally lives and grows.
Pro: Right, and as we’v discussed, there are some key elements that a habitat must contain, food obviously, water, it’s
67got to have the right climate and spaces for physical protection. And we saw how important habitat selection is when we
look at habitats where some of these factors are removed, perhaps through habitat destruction. I just read about a shorebird,
the plover.
The plover lives by the ocean and feeds on small shellfish, insects and plants. It blends in with the sand, so it’s
well-camouflaged from predator birds above. But it lays its eggs in shallow depressions in the sand with very little
protection around them. So if there are people or dogs on the beach, the eggs and fledglings in the nests are really
vulnerable. Out in California where there has been a lot of human development by the ocean. The plovers are now a
threatened species. So conservationists tried to recreate a new habitat for them. They made artificial beaches and sand bars
in areas inaccessible to people and dogs. And the plover population is up quite a bit in those places.
Ok. That is an instance where a habitat is made less suitable. But now, what about cases where an animal exhibits a
clear choice between two suitable habitats? In cases like that, does the preference matter? Well, Let's look at the blue
warbler.
The Blue warbler is a songbird that lives in North America. They clearly prefer hard wood forests with dense shrubs,
bushes underneath the trees. They actually nest in the shrubs, not the trees. So they’re pretty close to the ground, but these
warblers also nest in forests that have low shrub density. It is usually the younger warblers that nest in these areas because
the preferred spots where there are a lot of shrubs are taken by the older, more dominant birds.
And the choice of habitat seems to affect reproductive success. Because the older, more experienced birds who nest in
the high density shrub areas have significantly more offspring than those in low density areas, which suggests that the
choice of where to nest does have an impact on the number of chicks they have.
But a preferred environment doesn't always seem to correlate with greater reproductive success. For example, In
Europe, studies have been done of blackcap warblers. We just call them blackcaps.
The Blackcap can be found in two different environments. Their preferred habitat is forests near the edge of streams.
However, blackcaps also live in pine woods away from water. Studies have been done on the reproductive success rates for
the birds in both areas, and the result showed surprisingly that the reproductive success was essentially the same in both
areas--- the preferred and the second choice habitat. Well. Why?
It turned out that there were actually four times as many bird pairs or couples living in the stream edge habitat
compared to the area away from the stream. So this stream edge area had a much denser population, which meant more
members of the same species competing for resources, wanting to feed on the same things or build their nests in the same
places, which lower the suitability of the prime habitat even though it’s their preferred habitat. So the results of the study
suggest that when the number of the competitors in the prime habitat reaches a certain point, the second rank habitat
becomes just as successful as the prime habitat, just because there are fewer members of the same species living there. So it
looks like competition for resources is another important factor in determining if a particular habitat is suitable.
TPO 8 Lecture 2 Art History
Pro: We‘ve been talking about the art world of the late 19th century in Paris. And today I’d like to look at the women
who went to Paris at that time to become artists. Now from your reading what do you know about Paris, about the art world
of Paris during the late 19th century?
Stu: People came there from all over the world to study.
68Stu: It had a lot of art schools and artists who taught painting. There were, our book mentions classes for women artists.
And it was a good place to go to study art.
Pro: If you wanted to become an artist, Paris was not a good place to go; Paris was THE place to go. And women could
find skilled instructors there. Before the late 19th century. If they women who wanted to become artists had to take private
lessons or learn from family members. They had more limited options than men did. But around 1870s, some artists in Paris
began to offer classes for female students. These classes were for women only. And by the end of the 19th century, it
became much more common for women and men to study together in the same classes. So within a few decades, things had
changed significantly.
OK. Let’s back up again and talk about the time period from the 1860s to the 1880s and talk more about what
happened in women’s art classes. In 1868, a private art academy opened in Paris, and for decades it was probably the most
famous private art school in the world. Its founder Rodolphe Julian was a canny businessman. And quickly established his
school as a premier destination for women artists. What he did was: After an initial trail period of mixed classes, he changed
the school policy. He completely separated the men and women students.
Stu: Any reason why he did that?
Pro: Well. Like I said Julian was a brilliant businessman, with progressive ideas. He saw that another small private art
school where all the students were women was very popular at that time. And that’s probably why he adopted the women
only classes. His classes were typically offered by... by established artists and were held in the studio, the place where they
painted. This was a big deal because finally women could study art in a formal setting. And there was another benefit to the
group setting of these classes. The classes included weekly criticism. And the teacher would rank the art of all the students
in the class from best to worst. How would you like it if I did that in this class?
Stu1: Hah…No way.
Stu2: But our textbook said that the competitive…the competition was good for women. It helped them see where they
needed to improve.
Pro: Isn’t that interesting? One woman artist, her name was Marie Bashkirtseff. Bashkirtseff once wrote how she felt
about a classmate’s work. She thought her classmate’s art was much better than her own and it gave her an incentive to do
better. Overall the competition in the women’s art classes gave women more confidence. Confidence that they could also
compete in the art world after their schooling. And even though Bashkirtseff could not study in the same classes as men, she
was having an impact as an artist. Just look like the salon, what do you know about the salon?
Stu: It was a big exhibition, a big art show that they had in Pairs every year. They art had to be accepted by judges.
Stu: It was a big deal you can make a name for yourself.
Pro: You can have a painting or sculpture in the salon and go back to your home country saying you ‘ve been a success
in Paris. It was sort of uh, a seal of approval. It was a great encouragement for an artist’s career. And by the last two decades
of the 19th century, one fifth of the paintings in the salon were by women, much higher than in the past.
In fact, Marie Bashkirtseff herself had a painting in the salon in 1881. Interestingly this masterpiece called In the
Studio is a painting of the interior of Julian’s art school. It is not in your textbook. I will show you the painting next week.
The painting depicts an active crowded studio with women drawing and painting a live model. It was actually Bashkirtseff,
actually followed Julian’s savvy suggestion and painted her fellow students in a class at the school with the artist herself at
69the far right. A great advertisement for the school when the painting eventually hung up at the salon, for a women’s studio
had never been painted before.
TPO 8 Conversation 2
Pro: So, Richard... what’s up?
Stu:Well, I know we have a test coming up on chapters.
Pro: Chapters 3 and 4 from your textbook.
Stu: Right, 3 and 4, well, I didn’t get something you said in class Monday.
Pro: Alright. Do you remember what it was about?
Stu: Yeah, you were talking about a gym... a health club where people can go to exercise, that kind of thing.
Pro: Ok, but the health-club model is actually from chapter 5.so…
Stu: Oh, chapter 5? Oh so it not... OK but I guess I still want to try to understand…
Pro: Of course, well, I was talking about an issue in strategic marketing, the healthy club model; I mean with a health
club you might think they would have trouble attracting customers right?
Stu: Well, I know when I pass by a healthy club and I see all those people working out, they’re exercising, I just as
soon walk on by.
Pro: Yes, there is that. Plus, lots of people have exercise equipment at home, or they can play sports with their friends.
Right?
Stu: Sure.
Pro: But nowadays in spite of all that, and expensive membership fees, health clubs are hugely popular, so how come?
Stu: I guess that is what I didn’t understand.
Pro: Ok, basically they have to offer things that most people can’t find anywhere else, you know quality, that means
better exercise equipment, high-end stuff, and classes... exercise classes, maybe aerobics.
Stu: I am not sure if I…ok I get it. And you know another thing is I think people probably feel good about themselves
when they are at the gym. And they can meet new people, socialize.
Pro: Right, so health clubs offer high quality facilities. And also they sell an image about people having more fun,
relating better to others and improving their own lives if they become members.
Stu: Sure that makes sense.
70Pro: Well, then, can you think of another business or organization that could benefit from doing this? Think about an
important building on campus here, something everyone uses, a major source of information?
Stu: You mean like an administrative building?
Pro: Well, that is not what I had in my mind.
Stu: You mean the library.
Pro: Exactly. Libraries, imagine publish libraries; They’re an information resource for the whole community right?
Stu: Well they can be, but now with the internet and big book stores, you can probably get what you need without
going to a library.
Pro: That’s true. So if you were the director of a public library, what would you do about that?
Stu: To get more people to stop in, well, like you said, better equipment, maybe a super fast internet connection, and
not just a good variety of books but also like nice and comfortable areas where people can read and do research. Things that
make them want to come to the library and stay.
Pro: Great!
Stu: Oh, and maybe have authors come and do some readings or ... I don’t know, special presentations. Something
people couldn’t get at home.
Pro: Now, you are getting it.
Stu: Thanks, Professor Wilkins, I think too.
TPO 8 Lecture 3 History
Pro: So we’ve been talking about the printing press, how it changed people’s lives, making books more accessible to
everyone. More books meant more reading, right? But, as you know, not everyone has perfect vision. This increase in
literacy, um, in reading, led to an increase in demand for eyeglasses. And here’s something you probably haven’t thought of.
This increased demand impacted societal attitudes towards eyeglasses.
But, first let me back up a bit and talk about vision correction before the printing press. And, um, what did people with
poor vision do, I mean, especially those few people who were actually literate? What did they do before glasses were
invented? Well, they had different ways of dealing with not seeing well. If you think about it, poor vision wasn’t their only
problem. I mean, um, think about the conditions they lived in: houses were dark, sometimes there weren’t any windows;
candles were the only source of light. So in some places, um, like ancient Greece for example, the wealthiest people with
poor vision could have someone else read to them- easy solution if you could afford it.
Another solution was something called a “reading stone”. Around 1000 C.E. European monks would take a piece of
clear rock, often quartz, and place it on top of the reading material. The clear rock magnified the letters, making themappear larger, um, well, it’s like what happens when a drop of water falls on something, whatever’s below the drop of water
appears larger, right? Well, the “reading stone” works in a similar way.
71But rocks like quartz, well, quartz of optical quality weren’t cheap. Late in the 13th century, glass makers in Italy came
up with a less expensive alternative. They made reading stones out of clear glass. And these clear glass reading stones
evolved into the eyeglasses we know today. So we’re pretty sure that glasses were invented about the late 1200’s, well, over
a hundred years before the printing press. But it’s not clear who exactly invented them first or exactly what year. But record
shows that they were invented in both Europe and China at about the same time. By the way, we call this “independent
discovery”. Independent discovery means when something is invented in different parts of the world at the same time and
it’s not as unusual as it sounds. You can look at the timeline charts in the back of your textbook to see when things were
invented in different cultures at about the same time to see what I’m talking about.
So now let’s tie this to what I’ve said before about societal attitudes towards glasses. Initially in parts of Europe and in
China, glasses were a symbol of wisdom and intelligence. This is evident in the artwork from the period. European
paintings often portrayed doctors or judges wearing glasses. In China, glasses were very expensive. So in addition to
intelligence, they also symbolize affluence, um, wealth. In 14th-century Chinese portraits, the bigger the glasses, the smarter
and wealthier the subject was. So glasses were a status symbol in some parts of the world.
Now let’s get back to the invention of the painting press in 1440. What happened? Suddenly, books became readily
available and more people wanted to read. So the need, oh well, actually not only the need but the demand for more
affordable glasses rose drastically. Eventually, inexpensive glasses were produced, and then glasses were available to
everyone. People could purchase them easily from a traveling peddler.
TPO8 Lecture 4 Chemistry
Pro: So, are there any questions?
Stu: Yes, um, Professor Harrison, you were saying that the periodic table is predictive. What exactly does that mean? I
mean I understand how it organizes the elements but where’s the prediction?
Pro: Ok, let’s look at our periodic table again. Ok, it groups elements into categories that share certain properties,
right?
Stu: Uh-huh.
Pro: And it is arranged according to increasing atomic number, which is…
Stu: The number of protons in each atom of an element.
Pro: Right, well, early versions of the periodic table had gaps, missing elements. Every time you had one more proton,
you had another element. And then, oops, there’d be an atomic number, for which there was no known element. And the
prediction was that an element with that atomic number existed somewhere, but it just hadn’t been found yet. And its
location in the table would tell you what properties it should have. It was really pretty exciting for scientists at that time to
find these missing elements and confirm their predictive properties.
Um, actually, that reminds of a ... of a very good example of all these, element 43. See on the table, the symbols for
elements 42 and 44. Well, in early versions of the table, there was no symbol for an element 43 protons because no element
with 43 protons had been discovered yet. So the periodic table had a gap between elements 42 and 44.
72And then in 1925, a team of chemists led by a scientist named Ida Tacke claimed that they had found element 43. They
had been using a relatively new technology called X-ray spectroscopy, and they were using this to examine an ore sample.
And they claimed that they’d found an element with 43 protons. And they named it Masurium.
Stu: Um, Professor Harrison, then, how come in my periodic table here, element 43 is Tc, that’s Technetium, right?
Pro: Ok, let me add that. Actually, um, that’s the point I’m coming to. Hardly anyone believed that Tacke’d discovered
a new element. X-ray spectroscopy was a new method at that time. And they were never able to isolate enough Masurium to
have a weighable sample to convince everyone of the discovery. So they were discredited.
But then, 12 years later in 1937, a different team became the first to synthesize an element using a cyclotron. And that
element had…
Stu: 43 protons?
Pro: That’s right, but they named it Technetium to emphasize that it was artificially created with technology. And
people thought that synthesizing this element, making it artificially was the only way to get it. We still hadn’t found it
occuring in nature.
Now element 43, whether you call it Masurium or Technetium, is radioactive. Why does that matter? What is true of a
radioactive element?
Stu: It decays, it turns into other elements. Oh, so does that explain why it was missing in the periodic table?
Pro: Exactly, because of its radioactive decay, element 43 doesn’t last very long. And therefore, if that ever had been
present on Earth, it would have decayed ages ago. So the Masurium people were obviously wrong, and the Technetiumpeople were right. Right? Well, that was then, now we know that element 43 does occur naturally. It can be naturally
generated from Uranium atoms that have spontaneously split. And guess what, the ore sample the Masurium group was
working with had plenty of Uranium in it enough to split into measurable amounts of Masurium. So Tacke’s team might
very well have found small amounts of Masurium in the ore sample. It’s just that once was generated from split Uranium, it
decayed very quickly.
And you know here’s an incredible irony, Ida Tacke, the chemist led the Masurium team, well, she was the first to
suggest that Uranium could break up into smaller pieces, but she didn’t know that that was the defense of her own discovery
of element 43.
Stu: So is my version of the periodic table wrong? Should element 43 really be called Masurium?
Pro: Maybe, but you know it’s hard to tell for sure after all this time, if Ida Tacke’s group did discover element 43.
They didn’t, um, publish enough detail on their methods or instruments for us to know for sure. But I’d like to think element
43 was discovered twice. As Masurium, it was the first element discovered that occurs in nature only from spontaneous
fission, and as Technetium, it was the first element discovered in a laboratory. And of course, it was an element the periodic
table let us to expect existed before anyone had found it or made it.

73Conversation 1
Listen to a conversation between a student and her professor.
P: Before we get started, I...I just wanted to say I’m glad you chose food science for your major course of study.
S: Yeah, it seems like a great industry to get involved with. I mean with a four-year degree in food science, I'll always
be able to find a job.
P: You're absolutely right. Before entering academia, I worked as a scientist for several food manufacturers and for the
US Food and Drug Administration. I even worked on a commercial fishing boat in Alaska a couple of summers while I was
an undergraduate. We’d bring in the day's catch to a floating processor boat where the fish got cleaned, packaged and frozen
right at sea.
S: That's amazing! As a matter of fact, I'm sort of interested in food packaging.
P: Well, for that, you'll need a strong background in physics, math and chemistry.
S: Those are my best subjects. For a long time, I was leaning towards getting my degree in engineering.
P: Well, then you shouldn’t have a problem. Uh, and fortunately, at this university, the department of food science
offers a program in food packaging. Elsewhere, you might have to hammer courses together on your own.
S: I guess I luck out then. I am… so since my appointment today is to discuss my term paper topic, I wanted to ask,
could I write about food packaging? I realize we're supposed to research food-born bacteria, but food packaging must play a
role in all of that, right?
P: Absolutely! Maybe you should do some preliminary research on that.
S: I have! That's the problem. I'm overwhelmed.
P: Well, in your reading, did anything interest you in particular? I mean something you’d like to investigate.
S: well, I was surprised about the different types of packaging used for milk. You know, clear plastic bottles, opaque
bottles, carton board containers...
P: True! In fact, the type of packaging has something to do with the way milk's treated against bacteria.
S: Yeah, and I read a study that showed how light can give milk a funny flavor and decrease its nutritional value. And
yet most milk bottles are clear. What's up about that?
P: Well consumers like being able to visually examine the color of the milk. That might be one reason that opaque
bottles haven't really caught on. But that study... I'm sure there is more studies on the subject. You shouldn't base your paper
on only one study.
S: Maybe I should write about those opaque plastic bottles. Find out if there is any scientific reasons they aren't used
more widely? Maybe opaque bottles aren't as good at keeping bacteria from growing in milk after the bottle has been
opened for something… but where to begin researching this? I don't have a...
P: You know, there is a dairy not far from here in Chelsea. It was one of the first diaries to bottle milk in opaque plastic,
but now they're using clear plastic again. And they're always very supportive of the university and our students, so if you
wanted...
S: Yeah, I like that idea.
TPO 9 Lecture 1 Theater
Listen to part of a lecture in a theater class.
Pro: As we have seen, the second half of the 18th century was an exciting time in Europe: it was not only an age of
great invention, but social changes also led to a rise in all sorts of entertainment, from reading to museums, to travel. And
finding himself in the middle of this excitement was an accomplished French painter named Philippe Jacques de
Loutherbourg.
74Loutherbourg arrived in England in 1771, and immediately went to work as a set designer at the famous Drury Lane
Theater in London. From his first shows, Loutherbourg showed a knack for imagination and stage design, all in the interest
of creating illusions that allowed the audience to suspend disbelief completely. He accomplished this by giving the stage a
greater feeling of depth, which he did by cutting up some of the rigid background scenery, and placing it at various angles
and distances from the audience. Another realistic touch was using three-dimensional objects on the set, like rocks and
bushes as opposed to two-dimensional painted scenery. He also paid much more attention to lighting and sound than had
been done before.
Now, these sets were so elaborate that many people attended the theater more for them than for the actors or the story.
At the time, people were wild for travel and for experiencing new places; but not everyone could afford it. Loutherbourg
outdid himself, however, with a show that he set up in his own home. He called it the "Eidophusikon".
"Eidophusikon" means something like representation of nature, and that's exactly what he intended to do: create
realistic moving scenes that change before the audiences' eyes. In this, he synthesized all his tricks from Drury Lane:
mechanical motions, sound, light, other special effects to create, if you will, an early multimedia production.
The "Eidophusikon" was Loutherbourg's attempt to release painting from the constraints of the picture frame. After all,
even the most action-filled exciting painting can represent only one moment in time; and any illusion of movement is gone
after the first glance. But Loutherbourg, like other contemporary painters, wanted to add the dimension of time to his
paintings. You know, the popular thinking is that Loutherbourg was influenced by landscape painting. But why can't we say
that the "Eidophusikon" actually influenced the painters? At the very least we have to consider that it was more ... it was
more of a mutual thing. We know, for example, that the important English landscape painter Thomas Gainsborough attended
almost all of the early performances, and his later paintings are notable for their increased color and dynamic use of light.
Loutherbourg's influence on the theater though, he was incredibly influential: the way he brought together design and
lighting and sound as a unified feature of the stage, can easily be seen in English theater's subsequent emphasis on lighting
and motion.
Now, the "Eidophusikon" stage was actually a box: a few meters wide, a couple meters tall and a couple meters deep.
That is, the action took place within this box. This was much smaller of course than the usual stage. But, it also allowed
Loutherbourg to concentrate the lighting to better effect. Also, the audience was in the dark, which wouldn't be a common
feature of the theater until a hundred years later. The show consisted of a series of scenes, for example, a view of London
from sunrise that changes as the day moves on; mechanical figures, such as cattle, moved across the scene, and ships sailed
along the river.
But what really got people was the attention to detail, much like his work at Drury Lane. So, for example, he painted
very realistic ships, and varied their size depending on their distance from the audience. Small boats moved more quickly
across the foreground than larger ones did that were closer to the horizon. Other effects, like waves, were also very
convincing. They reflected sunlight or moonlight depending on the time of day or night. Even the colors changed as they
would in nature. Sound and light were important in making his productions realistic. He used a great number of lamps, and
he was able to change colors of light by using variously colored pieces of glass, to create effects like passing clouds that
suddenly change in color. Furthermore, he used effects to make patterns of shadow and light, rather than using the uniformlighting that was common at the time. And many of the sound effects he pioneered are still in use today, like creating
thunder by pulling on one of the corners of a thin copper sheet.
One of his most popular scenes was of a storm. And there is a story that on one occasion, an actual storm passed over
head during the show. And some people went outside, and they claimed Loutherbourg's thunder was actually better than the
real thunder.
75TPO 9 Lecture 2 Environmental Science
Listen to a part of lecture in an environmental science class.
Lecturer: So since we're on the topic of global climate change and its effects, in Alaska, in the northern Arctic part of
Alaska, over the last ... oh... thirty years or so, temperatures have increased about half a degree Celsius per decade, and
scientists have noticed that there’s been a change in surface vegetation during this time. Shrubs are increasing in the
"tundra".
Tundra is flat land with very little vegetation. Just a few species of plants grow there because the temperature is very
cold, and there's not much precipitation. And because of the cold temperatures, the tundra has two layers: top layer, which is
called the active layer, is frozen in the winter and spring, but thaws in the summer. Beneath this active layer is a second
layer called "permafrost", which is frozen all year around, and is impermeable to water.
Female Student: So because of the permafrost, none of the plants that grow there can have deep roots, can they?
Lecturer: No, and that's one of the reasons that shrubs survive in the Arctic. Shrubs are little bushes. They're not tall
and being low to the ground protects them from the cold and wind. And their roots don't grow very deep, so the permafrost
doesn't interfere with their growth. OK?
Now since the temperatures have been increasing in Arctic Alaska, the growth of shrubs has increased. And this has
presented climate scientists with a puzzle...
Male Student: I'm sorry, when you say the growth of shrubs has increased, do you mean that the shrubs are bigger, or
that there are more shrubs?
Lecturer: Good question! And the answer is both. The size of the shrubs has increased and shrub cover has spread to
what was previously shrub-free tundra. Ok, so what's the puzzle? Warmer temperatures should lead to increased vegetation
growth, right? Well, the connection is not so simple. The temperature increase has occurred during the winter and spring,
not during the summer. But the increase in shrubs has occurred in the summer. So how can increase temperatures in the
winter and spring result in increased shrub growth in the summer?
Well, it may be biological processes that occur in the soil in the winter, that cause increased shrub growth in the
summer, and here's how: there are "microbes", microscopic organisms that live in the soil. These microbes enable the soil to
have more nitrogen, which plants need to live and they remain quite active during the winter. There're two reasons for this:
first, they live in the active layer, which, remember, contains water that doesn't penetrate the permafrost. Second, most of
the precipitation in the Arctic is in the form of snow. And the snow, which blankets the ground in the winter, actually has an
insulating effect on the soil beneath it. And it allows the temperature of the soil to remain warm enough for microbes to
remain active. So there's been increased nutrient production in the winter. And that's what's responsible for the growth of
shrubs in the summer and their spread to new areas of the tundra. Areas with more new nutrients are the areas with the
largest increase in shrubs.
Female student: But, what about run-off in the spring, when the snow finally melts? Won't the nutrients get washed
away? Spring thaw always washes away soil, doesn't it?
Lecturer: Well, much of the soil is usually still frozen during peak run-off. And the nutrients are deep down in the
76active layer anyway, not high up near the surface, which is the part of the active layer most affected by run-off.
But as I was about to say, there's more to the story. The tundra is windy, and the snow is blown across the tundra, it's
caught by shrubs. And deep snow drifts often form around shrubs. And we've already mentioned the insulating effect of
snow. So that extra warmth means even more microbial activity, which means even more food for the shrubs, which means
even more shrubs and more snow around etc.. It's a circle, a loop. And because of this loop, which is promoted by warmer
temperatures in winter and spring, well, it looks like the tundra may be turning into shrub land.
Female student: But will it be long-term? I mean maybe the shrubs will be abundant for a few years, and then it'll
change back to tundra.
Lecturer: Well, shrub expansion has occurred in other environments, like semiarid grassland, and tall grass prairies.
And shrub expansion in these environments does seem to persist, almost to the point of causing a shift. Once is established,
shrub land thrives, particularly in the Arctic, because Arctic shrubs are good at taking advantage of increased nutrients in the
soil, better than other Arctic plants.

S: Well, I received a letter in my mailbox saying that I'm supposed to return a book that I checked out back in January,
it's call "Modern Social Problems". But because I'm writing my senior thesis, I'm supposed to be able to keep the book all

L: So you signed up for extended borrowing privileges?
S: Yeah.
L: But we are still asking you to bring the book back?
S: Uh-huh.
L: Well, let me take a look and see what the computer says. The title was
"Modern Social Problems"?
S: Yeah.
L: OK. Um... Oh, I see, it's been recalled. You can keep it all semester as long as no one else requests it. But, someone
else has. It looks like one of the professors in the sociology department has requested it. So you have to bring it back, even
though you've got extended borrowing privileges. You can check out the book again when it's returned in a couple of weeks.
S: But I really need this book right now.
77L: Do you need all of it or is there a certain section or chapter you're working with?
S: I guess there is one particular chapter I've been using lately for a section of my thesis. Why?
L: Well, you can photocopy up to one chapter of the book. Why don't you do that for the chapter you're working on
right now? And by the time you need the rest of the book, maybe it will have been returned. We can even do the
photocopying for you because of the circumstances.
S: Oh, well, that would be great.
L: I see you've got some books there. Is that the one you were asked to return?
S: No, I left it in my dorm room. These are books I need to check out today. Is it Ok if I bring that one by in a couple of
days?
L: Actually, you need to return it today. That is if you want to check out those books today. That's our policy.
S: Oh, I didn't know that.
L: Yeah, not a lot of people realize that. In fact, every semester we get a few students who have their borrowing
privileges suspended completely because they haven't returned books. They're allowed to use books only in the library.
They're not allowed to check anything out because of unreturned books.
S: That's not good. I guess I should head back down to the dorm right now then.
L: But, before you go, what you should do is fill out a form requesting the book back in two weeks. You don't want to
waste any time getting it back.
S: Thanks a lot. Now I don't feel quite so bad about having to return the book.
TPO 9 Lecture 3 Geology
Lecturer: So, continuing our discussion of desert lakes, now I want to focus on what's known as the "Empty Quarter".
The "Empty Quarter" is a huge area of sand that covers about a quarter of the Arabian Peninsula. Today it's pretty desolate,
barren and extremely hot. But there've been times in the past when monsoon rains soaked the Empty Quarter and turned it
from a desert into grassland that was dotted with lakes and home to various animals. There were actually two periods of rain
and lake formation: the first one began about 37,000 years ago; and the second one dates from about 10,000 years ago.
Female Student: Excuse me, Professor. But I'm confused. Why would lakes form in the desert? It's just sand, after all.
Lecturer: Good question! We know from modern day desert lakes, like Lake Eyre in South Australia, that under the
right conditions, lakes do form in the desert. But the Empty Quarter lakes disappeared thousands of years ago. They left
behind their beds or basins as limestone formations that we can still see today. They look like low-lying, white or grey
buttes, long, narrow hills with flat tops, barely a meter high.
A recent study of some of the formations presents some new theories about the area's past. Keep in mind though that
78this study only looked at 19 formations. And about a thousand have been documented. So there's a lot more work to be
done.
According to the study, two factors were important for lake formation in the Empty Quarter: first the rains that fell
there were torrential. So it would've been impossible for all the water to soak into the ground. Second, as you know, sand
dunes contain other types of particles, besides sand, including clay and silt. Now, when the rain fell, water ran down the
sides of the dunes, carrying clay and silt particles with it. And wherever these particles settled, they formed a pan, a layer
that water couldn't penetrate. Once this pan formed, further run-off collected, and formed a lake.
Now, the older lakes, about half the formations, the ones that started forming 37000 years ago, the limestone
formations we see, they're up to a kilometer long, but only a few meters wide, and they're scattered along the desert floor, in
valleys between the dunes. So, the theory is, the lakes formed there on the desert floor, in these long narrow valleys. And we
know, because of what we know about similar ancient desert lakes, we know that the lakes didn't last very long, from a few
months to a few years on average. As for the more recent lakes, the ones from 10000 years ago, well, they seemed to have
been smaller, and so may have dried up more quickly.
Another difference, very important today for distinguishing between older lake beds and newer ones, is the location of
the limestone formations. The more recent beds are high up in the dunes.
Why these differences? Well, there are some ideas about that, and they have to do with the shapes of the sand dunes,
when the lakes were formed. 37000 years ago, the dunes were probably nicely rounded at the top, so the water just ran right
down their sides to the desert floor. But there were thousands of years of wind between the two rainy periods, reshaping the
dunes. So, during the second rainy period, the dunes were kind of chopped up at the top, full of hollows and ridges, and
these hollows would've captured the rain right there on the top.
Now, in a grassland of Lake Ecosystem, we'd expect to find fossils from a variety of animals, and numerous fossils
have been found at least at these particular sites. But, where did these animals come from? Well, the theory that has been
suggested is that they migrated in from nearby habitats where they were already living. Then as the lakes dried up, they died
out.
The study makes a couple of interesting points about the fossils, which I hope will be looked at in future studies. At
older lake sites, there’s fossil remains from hippopotamuses, water buffalo, animals that spend much of their lives standing
in water, and also, fossils of cattle. However, at the sites of the more recent lakes, there’ s only cattle fossils, additional
evidence for geologists that these lakes were probably smaller, shallower, because cattle only use water for drinking. So
they survive on much less. Interestingly, there are clams and snail shells; but, no fossils of fish. We're not sure why. Maybe
there was a problem with the water. Maybe it was too salty. That's certainly true of other desert lakes.
TPO 9 Lecture 4 Linguistic
Listen to part of a lecture in a linguistics class. The professor has been discussing Animal communication systems.
L: OK, so last time, we covered the dances honey bees do to indicate where food can be found and the calls and songs
of different types of birds. Today, I'd like to look at some communication systems found in mammals, particularly in
primates, such as orangutans, chimpanzees, gorillas... Yes, Thomas?
T: Excuse me, Professor. But when you talk about gorilla language, do you mean like, those experiments where
79humans taught them sign language or a language like...
L: OK, wait just a minute. Now, who in this class heard me use the word "language"? No one I hope. What we're
talking about here, are systems of communication, all right?
T: Oh, sorry, communication, right. But could you maybe, like, clarify what the difference is?
L: Of course, that's a fair question. OK, well, to start with, let's make it clear that language is a type of communication,
not the other way around. OK, so all communication systems, language included, have certain features in common.
For example, the signals used to communicate from the bee's dance movements, to the word and sentences found in
human languages. All these signals convey meaning. And all communication systems serve a purpose, a pragmatic function
of some sort. Warning of danger perhaps or offering other needed information.
But there're several features peculiar to human language that have, for the most part, never been found in the
communication system of any other species.
For one thing, learn ability. Animals have instinctive communication systems. When a dog, a puppy gets to certain age,
it's able to bark. It barks without having to learn how from other dogs, it just barks. But much of human language has to be
learned from other humans.
What else makes human language unique? What makes it different from animal communication? Deborah?
D: How about grammar? Like having verbs, nouns, adjectives?
L: OK, that's another feature. And it's a good example...
D: I mean I mention this ‘cause like in my biology class last year, I kind of remember talking about a study on prairie
dogs, where, I think the researchers claimed that the warning cries of prairie dogs constitute language, because they have
these different parts of speech. You know, like nouns, to name the type of predator they spotted, adjectives to describe its
size and shape, verbs..., but now it seems like...
L: All right, hold on a moment. I'm familiar with the study you're talking about. And for those of you who don't know,
prairie dogs are not actually dogs. They're a type of rodent who, who burrow in the ground in the grasslands of the western
United States and Mexico.
In this study, the researchers looked at the high-pitched barks a prairie dog makes when it spots predator. And from this
they made some pretty.., well, they made some claims about these calls qualifying as an actual language, with its own
primitive grammar. But actually, these warning calls are no different from those found among certain types of monkeys.
And, well, let's not even get into the question of whether concepts like noun and verb can be meaningfully applied to animal
communication.
Another thing that distinguishes a real language is a property we call "discreteness". In other words, messages are built
up out of smaller parts, sentences out of words, words out of individual sounds, etc. Now maybe you could say that the
prairie dog's message is built from smaller parts, like say for example, our prairie dog spots a predator, a big coyote
approaching rapidly. So the prairie dog makes a call that means "coyote", then one that means "large", and then another one
to indicate its speed. But do you really suppose it makes any difference what order these calls come in? No.
But the discrete units that make up language can be put together in different ways. Those smaller parts can be used to
form an infinite number of messages, including messages that are completely novel, that have never been expressed before.
80For example, we can differentiate between: "A large coyote moves fast." and say "Move the large coyote fast." or "Move
fast, large coyote.", and I truly doubt whether anyone has ever uttered either of these sentences before.
Human language is productive, an open-ended communication system, whereas no other communication system has
this property.
And another feature of language that's not displayed by any form of animal communication is what we call
"displacement". That is, language is abstract enough that we can talk about things that aren't present here and now. Things
like "My friend Joe is not in the room." or "It will probably rain next Thursday." Prairie dogs may be able to tell you about a
hawk that’s circling overhead right now, but they never show any inclination to describe the one they saw last week.

what a gallery is looking for? How would I know, how do I make the right contacts to get it into a show, I just really don't... Professor
OK, hold on, slow down. Um…these are questions that, well, just about every young artist has to struggle with. OK,
the first thing you should do is you absolutely have to stay true to your artistic vision; take the pictures you want to take. Don't start trying to catch the flavor the month and be trendy because you think you’ll get into a show--- that never
works, because you wind up creating something you don't really believe in. It’s uninspired, and won’t make any shows. I've
seen it happen so many times. This doesn't mean that you should go into a cave. Keep up with trends, even think about how
your work might fit in with them, but don't mindlessly follow them.
Student
Well, yeah, I can see that. I think though I have always been able to stay pretty true to what I want to create, not what
others want me to create. I think that comes through in my work.
Professor
OK, just remember that is one thing to create work that you really want to create when it’s in the classroom. The only
thing at stake is your grade. But work created outside the classroom? That can be in different story. I'm not talking about
81technique or things like that. It's just that there is so much more at stake when you are out there making art for a living.
There’s a lot of pressure to become something you are not, and people often surrender to that pressure.
Student
But to get stuff exhibited…
Professor
Well, you need to be a bit of an opportunist. You know, common sense things like always having a sample of your
work on hand to give to people. You won’t believe the kind of contacts and opportunities you can get in this way. And try to
get your work seen in the places like restaurants, bookstores, you’d be surprised how word gets around about photography
in places like that.
Student
OK it's just so hard to think about all of those practical things and make good work, you know.
TPO 10 Lecture 1 Marine Biology
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a Marine Biology Class
Professor
We know whales are mammals and that they evolved from land creatures. So the mystery is figuring out how they
became ocean dwellers. Because until recently there was no fossil record of what we call “the missing link”- that is
evidence of species that show the transition between land-dwelling mammals and today’s whales. Fortunately, some recent
fossil discoveries have made the picture a little bit clearer.
For example, a few years back in Pakistan, they found the skull of a wolf-like creature. It was about 50 million years
old. Scientists had seen this wolf-like creature before, but this skull was different. The ear area of the skull had
characteristics seen only in aquatic mammals, specifically whales.
Uh, well, then also in Pakistan they found a fossil of another creature, which we call Ambulocetus Natans. That’s a
mouthful, eh? The name Ambulocetus natans comes from Latin of course, and means “walking whale that swims”. It clearly
had four limbs that could have been used for walking. It also had a long thin tail, typical of mammals, something we don’t
see in today’s whales. But, it also had a long skeletal structure. And that long skeletal structure suggests that it was aquatic.
And very recently in Egypt, they found a skeleton of Basilosaurus. Basilosaurus was a creature that we’ve already
known about for over a hundred years. And it has been linked to modern whales because of its long whale-like body. But
this new fossil find showed a full set of leg bones, something we didn’t have before. The legs were too small to be useful.
They weren’t even connected to its pelvis and couldn’t have supported its weight. But it clearly shows Basilosaurus’s
evolution from land creatures. So that’s a giant step in the right direction. Even better, it establishes Ambulocetus natans as a
clear link between the wolf-like creature and Basilosaurus.
Now these discoveries don’t completely solve the mystery. I mean, Ambulocetus is a mammal that shows a sort of
bridge between walking on land and swimming. But it also is very different from the whales who know today. So really we
are working just a few pieces of a big puzzle.
Um…a related debate involved some recent DNA studies. Remember, DNA is the genetic code for any organism. And
82when the DNA from two different species is similar, it suggests that those two species are related. And when we compared
some whale DNA with DNA from some other species, we got quite a surprise. The DNA suggests that whales are
descendants of the hippopotamus. Yes, the hippopotamus! Well, it came as a bit of a shock. I mean, that a four-legged land
and river dweller could be the evolutionary source of a completely aquatic creature up to 25 times its size? Unfortunately
this revelation about the hippopotamus apparently contradicts the fossil record, which suggests that the hippopotamus is
only a very distant relative of the whale, not an ancestor. And of course as I mentioned, that whales are descended not fromhippos but from that distant wolf-like creatures.
So we have contradictory evidence. And more research might just raise more questions and create more controversies.
At any rate, we have a choice. We can believe the molecular data, the DNA, or we can believe the skeleton trail, but
unfortunately, not both.
Um… and there have been some other interesting findings from DNA research. For a long time, we assumed that all
whales that had teeth including sperm whales and killer whales were closely related to one another. And the same for the
toothless whales, like the blue whale and other baleen whales, we assumed that they be closely related. But recent DNA
studies suggest that that’s not the case at all. The sperm whale is actually closely related to the baleen whale, and it’s only
distantly related to the toothed-whales. So that was a real surprise to all of us.
TPO10 Lecture 2 European History
Narrator:
Listen to part of a lecture in a European History Class.
Professor
So would it surprise you to learn that many of the foods that we today consider traditional European dishes that their
key ingredients were not even known in Europe until quite recently, until the European started trading with the native
peoples of North and South America? I mean, you are probably aware that the Americas provide Europe and Asia with
foods like squash, beans, turkey, peanuts. But what about all those Italian tomato sauces, hungarian goulash or my favorite,
French fries? Those yummy fried potatoes.
Student
Wait. I mean I knew potatoes were from where, South America?
Professor
South America. Right, the Andes Mountains.
Student
But you are saying tomatoes too? I just assume since they’re used in so many Italian dishes.
Professor
No, like potatoes, Tomatoes grew wild in the Andes. Although unlike potatoes, they weren’t originally cultivated there.
That seems to have occurred first in Central America. And even then the tomato doesn’t appear to have been very important
as a food plant until the Europeans came on the scene. They took it back to Europe with them around 1550. And Italy was
indeed the first place where it was widely grown as a food crop. So in a sense, it really is more Italian than American.
And another thing and this is true of both potato and tomato. Both of these plants are members of the Nightshade
83family. The Nightshade family is a category of plants which also includes many that you wouldn’t want to eat, like
mandrake, belladonna, and even tobacco. So it’s no wonder that people once considered potatoes and tomatoes to be
inedible too, even poisonous. And in fact, the leaves of the potato plant are quite toxic. So it took both plants quite a while
to catch on in Europe. And even longer before they made the return trip to North America and became popular food items
here.
Student
Yeah, you know, I remember, I remember my grandmother telling me that when her mother was a little girl, a lot of
people still thought that tomatoes are poisonous.
Professor
Oh, sure. People didn’t really start eating them here until the mid-eighteen hundreds.
Student
But seems like I heard... didn’t Thomas Jefferson grow them or something?
Professor
Well, that’s true. But then Jefferson is known not only as the third president of the United States but also as a scholar
who was way ahead of his time in many ways. He didn’t let the conventional thinking of his day restrain his ideas.
Now, potatoes went through a similar sort of ...uh... of a rejection process, especially when they were first introduced
in Europe. You know how potatoes can turn green if they are left in the light too long? And that greenish skin can make the
potatoes tastes bitter; even make you ill. So that was enough to put people off for over 200 years. Yes, Bill?
Student
I’m sorry professor Jones. But I mean yeah ok. American crops have probably contributed a lot to European cooking
over the years. But…
Professor
But have they really played any kind of important role in European history? Well, as a matter of fact, yes. I was just
coming to that.
Let’s start with North American corn or maize, as it’s often called. Now before the Europeans made contact with the
Americas,
they subsisted mainly on grains, grains that often suffered from crop failures. And largely for this reason that political
power in Europe was centered for centuries in the South, around the Mediterranean Sea, which was where they could grow
these grains with more reliability.
But
when corn came to Europe from Mexico, well, now they had a much hardier crop that could be grown easily in more
northerly climates and the centers of power began to shift accordingly. And then, well, as I said potatoes weren’t really
popular at first. But when they finally did catch on which they did first in Ireland around 1780. Well, why do you suppose it
happen? Because potatoes have the ability to provide an abundant and extremely nutritious food crop, no other crop grew in
North Europe at the time had anything like the number of vitamins contained in potatoes. Plus, potatoes grown on the single
acre of land could feed many more people than say, wheat grown on the same land. Potatoes soon spread to France and
other Northern European countries. And as a result, the nutrition of the general population improved tremendously and
population soared in the early 1800s and so the shift of power from southern to northern Europe continued.

Narrator
Listen to a conversation between a student and an employee in the University bookstore.
Student
Hi, I bought this book at the beginning of the semester, but, some thing’s come up and… I’d like to return it.
Employee
Well, for a full refund: store policy is that you have to return merchandise 2 weeks from the time it was purchased. Uh...
but for assigned textbooks or anything having to do with specific courses. Wait... was it for a specific course?
Student
Yeah, but actually…
Employee
Well... for course books, the deadline is 4 weeks after the beginning of the semester. So this for this fall semester, the
deadline was October. 1st.
Student
Ouch, then I missed it. But, why October.1st?
Employee
Well, I guess the reasoning is the by October. 1st, the semester is in full gear. And everyone kind of knows what
courses they’ll be taking that semester
Student
I get it, so it’s mainly for people who decide to withdraw from… to change to new courses early on.
Employee
Exactly!!! The book has to been in perfect condition of course. They can’t be marked up or looked use in any way for
the full refund, I mean.
Student
Well, but, see, my situation is a little different. I hope you might be able to make an
exception.
Employee
Well, the policies are generally pretty rigid and the semester is almost over.
Student
Okay. Here’s what happened. Um~ I think my professor really miscalculated. Anyway the syllabus was way too
ambitious in my opinion. There’re only 2 weeks of classes left in the semester and there are like 6 books on the syllabus that
we haven’t even touched. Employee
I see. So you were hoping to return this one.
85Student
Yeah, the professor already announced that we won’t be reading this one by Jane Bowles and all the others I bought
used
Employee
Jane Bowles? Which book of hers?
Student
It called “Two serious ladies”
Employee
Oh, but you should keep that one. Are you interested in literature?
Student
Well. I am an English major.
Employee
You are lucky to have a professor who includes a lesser-known writer like her on the syllabus, you know, not the usual
authors we’ve all read.
Student
So you really think..
Employee
I do. And especially if you’re into literature
Student
Hmm... well, this I wasn’t expecting. I mean…uh.. Wow!
Employee
I hope you don’t think I am being pushy. If you prefer, you can return the book and arrange for a store credit, you don't
qualify for a refund. Policy is policy after all, but you can make an exchange and you can use the credit for your books for
next semester. The credit carries over for one semester to the next.
Student
Hmm…that’s good to know, but now I am really intrigued. I guess that just because we ran out of time to read this
book in class, doesn't mean that I can’ t read it on my own time. You know, I think I’ll give it a try.
TPO10 Lecture 3 Ecology
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an Ecology Class.
Professor
So we’ve been talking about nutrients, the elements in the environment that are essential for living organisms to
develop, live a healthy life and reproduce. Some nutrients are quite scarce; there just isn’t much of them in the environment.
86But fortunately they get recycled. When nutrients are used over and over in the environment, we call that a nutrient cycle.
Because of the importance of nutrients and their scarcity, nutrient recycling is one of the most significant eco-systemprocesses that we’ll cover in this course. The three most important nutrient recycles are the nitrogen cycle, the carbon cycle
and the one we are going to talk about today, the Phosphorus cycle.
So the Phosphorus cycle has been studied a lot by ecologists because like I said, Phosphorus is an important nutrient
and it’s not so abundant. The largest quantities are found in rocks and at the bottom of the ocean.
How does Phosphorus get there? Well, let’s start with the Phosphorus in rocks. The rocks get broken down into smaller
and smaller particles as they are weathered. They are weathered slowly by rain and wind over long periods of time.
Phosphorus is slowly released as the rocks are broken down and it gets spread around into the soil. Once it’s in the soil,
plants absorb it through their roots.
Student
So that’s the reason people mine rocks that contain a lot of Phosphorus to help with agriculture?
Professor
Uh-huh, they mined the rock, artificially break it down and put the Phosphorus into agricultural fertilizers. So humans
can play a role in the first part of the Phosphorus cycle -- the breaking down of rocks and the spreading of Phosphorus into
the soil by speeding up the rate at which this natural process occurs. You see.
Now after the Phosphorus is in the soil, plants grow. They use Phosphorus from the soil to grow. And when they die,
they decompose. And the Phosphorus is recycled back into the soil; same thing with the animals that eat those plants, or eat
other animals that have eaten those plants. We call all of this – the land phase of the Phosphorus cycle. But a lot of the
Phosphorus in soil gets washed away into rivers by rain and melting snow. And so begins another phase of the cycle. Can
anyone guess what it is called? Nancy?
Nancy
Well, if the one is called the land phase, then this has to be called the water phase, right?
Professor
Yes, that’s such a difficult point isn’t it? In a normal water phase, rivers eventually empty into oceans, and once in the
oceans, the Phosphorus gets absorbed by water plants like algae. Then fish eats the algae or eat other fish that have eaten
those plants.
But the water phase is sometime affected by excessive fertilizers. If not all of Phosphorus gets used by the crops and
large amounts of Phosphorus gets into the rivers. This could cause rapid growth of water plants in the river, which can lead
to the water ways getting clogged with organisms, which can change the flow of the water. Several current studies are
looking at these effects and I really do hope we can find a way to deal with this issue before these ecosystems are adversely
affected. Ok?
Of course, another way that humans can interrupt the normal process is fishing. The fishing industry helps bring
Phosphorus back to land. In the normal water phase the remaining Phosphorus makes its way, settles to the bottom of the
ocean and gets mixed into ocean sediments. But remember, this is a cycle. The Phosphorus at the bottom of the ocean has to
somehow make its way back to the surface, to complete the cycle, to begin the cycle all over again.
After millions of years, powerful geological forces, like underwater volcanoes lift up the ocean sediments to form new
land. When an underwater volcano pushes submerged rock to the surface, a new island is created. Then over many more
years the Phosphorus-rich rocks of the new land begin to erode and the cycle continues.
87Guy
What about, well, you said that the nitrogen cycle is also an important nutrient cycle. And there is a lot of nitrogen in
the atmosphere, so I was wondering, is there a lot of Phosphorus in the atmosphere too?
Professor
Good question, George. You’re right to guess that Phosphorus can end up in Earth’s atmosphere. It can move from the
land or from the oceans to the atmosphere, and vice versa. However, there’s just not a substantial amount of it there, like
there is with nitrogen, it’s a very minimal quantity.
TPO10 Lecture 4 Psychology
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a Psychology Class.
Professor
OK. If I ask about the earliest thing you can remember, I’ll bet for most of you, your earliest memory would be fromabout age 3, right? Well, that’s true for most adults. We can’t remember anything that happened before the age of 3. And this
phenomenon is so widespread and well-documented it has a name. It is called childhood amnesia and was first documented
in 1893.
As I said, this phenomenon refers to adults not being able to remember childhood incidents. It’s not children trying to
remember events from last month or last year. Of course it follows that if you can’t remember an incident as a child, you
probably won’t remember it as an adult. OK?
So …so... so why is this? What are the reasons for childhood amnesia?
Well, once a popular explanation was that childhood memories are repressed ... uh, the memories are disturbing so that
as adults we keep them buried, and so we can’t recall them. And this is based on…well, well, it’s not based on, on, on… the
kind of solid research and lab testing we want to talk about today. So let’s put that explanation aside and concentrate on just
two. OK?
It...it could be that as children we do form memories of things prior to age 3, but forget them as we get grow older,
that’s one explanation. Another possibility is that children younger than three lack...uh...lack some cognitive capacity for
memory. And that idea, that children are unable to form memories, that’s been the dominant belief in psychology for the
past hundred years.
And this idea is very much tied to two things, the theories of Jean Piaget and also to language development in children.
So Piaget’s theory of cognitive development. Piaget suggested that because they don’t have language, children younger
than 18 to 24 months live in the here and now, that is they lack the mean to symbolically represent objects and events, that
are not physically present. Everybody get that? Piaget proposed that young children don’t have a way to represent things
that aren’t right in front of them. That’s what language does, right? Words represent things, ideas.
Once language starts to develop from about age 2, they do have a system for symbolic representation and can talk
about things which aren’t in their immediate environment including the past. Of course he didn’t claim that infants don’t
have any sort of memory, it’s acknowledged that they can recognize some stimuli, like faces. And for many years this model
88was very much in favor in psychology, even though memory tests were never performed on young children.
Well, finally in the 1980s, a study was done. And this study showed that very young children under the age of 2 do
have the capacity for recall. Now, if the children can’ t talk, how was recall tested? Well, that is a good question, since the
capacity for recall has always been linked with the ability to talk.
So the researchers set up an experiment using imitation-based tasks. Adults used props, uh, toys or other objects to
demonstrate an action that had 2 steps. The children were asked to imitate the steps immediately and then again after delays
of one or more month. And even after a delay, the children could…could recall or replicate the action, the objects used, the
steps involved and the order of the steps. Even children as young as 9 months!
Now, tests showed that there was a faster rate of forgetting among the youngest children, but most importantly it
showed that the development of recall did not depend on language development. And that was an importance finding!
I guess I should add that the findings don’t say that there was no connection...no connection between the development
of language and memory. There’s some of evidence that being able to talk about an event does lead to having a stronger
memory of that event. But that does not seem to be the real issue here.
So, back to our question about the cause of childhood amnesia, well, there is something called the rate of forgetting.
And childhood amnesia may reflect a high rate of forgetting, in other words, children under the age of 3 do form memories
and do so without language. But they forget the memories at a fast rate, probably faster than adults do. Researchers have set
a standard….sort of an expected rate of forgetting, but that expected rate was set based on the tests done on adults. So what
is the rate of forgetting for children under the age of 3? We expect it to be high, but the tests to prove this really haven’t
been done yet.

OK. I’ll need your name, year, and university ID.
Student
Here’s my ID card. And my name is Gina Kent, and I’m first year.
Employee
OK. Gina. I’ll type up a pass for you right away.
Student
Great! This is exciting. I can’t wait to get started.
Employee
89Oh, this is a wonderful gym.
Student
That’s what everybody has been saying. Everyone is talking about the new
pool and the new indoor courts. But what I love is all the classes.
Employee
The classes…?
Student
Yes, like the swimming and tennis classes and everything.
Employee
Oh yeah, but this pass doesn’t entitle you to those.
Student
It doesn’t?
Employee
No, the classes fall into a separate category.
Student
But, that’s my whole reason for getting a pass. I mean, I was planning to take a
swimming class.
Employee
But that’s not how it works. This pass gives you access to the gym and to all the equipment, and to the pool and so
forth. But not when the teams are practicing, so you’ll have to check the schedule.
Student
But what do I have to do if I want to take a class?
Employee
You have to: one, register; and two, pay the fee for the class.
Student
But that’s not fair.
Employee
Well, I think if you think about it. You’ll see that it’s fair.
Student
But people who play sports in the gym… they don’t have to pay anything.
Employee
Yes, but they just come in, and play or swim on their own. But, taking a class---that is a different story, I mean,
someone has to pay the instructors.
Student
90So, if I want to enroll in a class....
Employee
Then you have to pay extra. The fee isn't very high, but there’s a fee. So, what class did you say you want to take?
Student
Swimming…
Employee
OK. Swimming classes are thirty dollars a semester.
Student
I guess I could swing that. But I’m still not convinced it’s fair. So, do I pay you?
Employee
Well, first, you need to talk to the instructor. They have to assess your level and steer you to the right class, you know,
beginner, intermediate…
Student
You mean, I have to swim for them? Show them what I can do?
Employee
No, no, you just tell them a little bit about your experience and skill, so they
know what level you should be in.
Student
Oh, OK. So, I guess I’ll need an appointment.
Employee
And I can make that for you right now. And then I’ll type up your gym ID card. You’ll need it to get into the building.
Now about that appointment… how does Wednesday at three sound?
Student
Fine…

OK. And you’ll be meeting with Mark Gettys. He’s the swimming instructor. He
also coaches the swim team. And here, I’ve jotted it all down for you.

TPO11 Lecture 1 Biology
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a Biology Class. The class has been learning
91about birds.
Professor
Ok, today we are going to continue our discussion of the parenting behaviors
of birds. And we are going to start by talking about what are known as
distraction displays.
Now if you are a bird and there is a predator around.
What are you going to do? Well, for one thing you are going to try to attract as little attention as possible, right?
Because if the predator doesn’t know you are there, it is not going to try to eat you. But sometimes certain species of birds
do the exact opposite. When a predator approaches, they do their best to attract the attention of that predator.
Now why would they do that? Well, they
do that to draw the predator away from their nest, away from their eggs or their young birds. And the behaviors that the
birds engage in to distract predators are called distraction displays. And there are a number of different kinds of distraction
displays.
Most of the time, when birds are engaging in distraction displays, they are going to be pretending either that they have
an injury or that they’re ill or that they’re exhausted. You know something that’ll make the predator think: Ah… here is an
easy meal.
One pretty common
distraction display is what’s called the broken-wing display. And in a broken-wing display, the bird spreads and drags a
wings or its tail, and while it does that, it slowly moves away from the nests. So it really looks like a bird with a broken
wing. And these broken-wing displays can be pretty convincing.
Another version of this kind of distraction display is where the bird creates the impression of a mouse or some other
small animals that’s running along the ground. A good example of that kind of display is created by a bird called the purple
sandpiper.
Now what’s the purple sandpiper does is when a predator approaches, it drags its wings but not to give the impression
that its wing is broken but to create the illusion that it has a second pair of legs. And then it raises its feathers, so it looks
like it’s got a coat of fur. And then it runs along the ground swerving left and right, you know like it’s running around little
rocks and sticks. And as it goes along, it makes this little squealing noise. So from a distance it really looks and sounds like
a little animal running along the ground trying to get away. Again to the predator, it looks like an easy meal.
Now what’s interesting is that birds have different levels of performance of these distraction displays. They don’t give
their top performance, their prime time performance every time. What they do is they save their best performances, their
most conspicuous and most risky displays for the time just before the baby birds become able to take care of themselves.
And they time it that way because that’s when they’ll have made the greatest investment in parenting their young. So they
are not going to put on their best performance just after they laid their eggs, because they haven’t invested that much time or
energy in parenting yet. The top performances are going to come later.
Now you have some birds that are quiet mature, are quite capable almost as soon as they hatch. In that case, the parent
will put on the most conspicuous distraction displays just before the babies hatch, because once the babies are hatched, they
can pretty much take care of themselves. And then you have others birds that are helpless when they hatch. In that case, the
parent will save its best performances until just before the babies get their feathers.
92TPO11 Lecture 2 Architecture
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an Architecture Class.
Professor
Today, we are taking a little detour from the grand styles of public architecture we’ve been studying to look at
residential architectures in the United States. Since this is something we can all identify with, I think it will help us see the
relationship between the function of a structure and its style or form. This has been an ongoing theme in our discussions,
and we will be getting back to it in just a moment. But before we get started, I want you to take a moment to think: does
anyone know what the single most popular style for a house in the United States is today? Bob?
Student 1
“I bet it is the ranch-style house.”
Professor
“Well, in this area, probably. But are we typical? Yes, Sue.”
Student 2
“How about the kind of house my grandparents live in? They call it a Cape
Cod.
Professor
That’s the one. Here is a drawing of what we consider of a classic Cape Cod house. These days, you see this style all
over the United States. But it first showed up in U.S. northeast, in the New England region, around the late 1600s. For those
of you who don't know the northeast coastal region, Cape Cod is a peninsula, a narrow strip of land that jets out into the
Atlantic, and so ... so, many houses in this particular style were built on Cape Cod, that the name of the place became the
name of the style.
Now why did the Cape Cod style house become so popular in the northeast? Well, one reason is that it's a great
example of form following function. We’ve talked about this design principle a lot about form following function. And what
did we say it meant? Someone give me an application of this principle. What is this concept that form should follow
function? How would it be applied to housing design?
Student 2
Well, if it means that the design of a building should be based on the needs of the people who use it. Then, well, the
architect has to be very practical to think about the people who’ll actually be living in the house or working in the office
building, whatever, so for the architect, it’s all about the users not about showing off how creative you can be.
Professor
Good, of course, for a Cape Cod house, it might be even more accurate to say that form also follows climate. Who
knows what the climate’s like on Cape Cod?
Student 1
Cold in the winter…
Student 2
93And whenever I visit my grandparents, it’s really wet. It’s usually either raining or snowing or foggy and windy, too. I
guess because it’s so exposed to the ocean?
Professor
That’s right. So take another look at this drawing, and you can imagine how this design might be particularly helpful in
that kind of climate. Notice how the house sits fairly low to the ground. This relatively low compact structure helps the
house withstand the strong winds blowing off the ocean.
And look at the
slope of the roof, the steep angle helps keep off all that rain and snow that accumulates in the winter.
Another thing, Cape Cod houses usually face south to take advantage of the sun’s warm through the windows. That’s
helpful in winter.
Now what can you tell me about the chimney, about its location?
Student 2
Well, it’s in the middle. Because, does that have something to do with heating the houses? I mean since the heat never
has to travel very far.
Student 1
That’d mean you can heat the house more efficiently, right?
Professor
Exactly, now see how the house has very little exterior decoration, that’s also typical of early Cape Cod houses. The
wind was one reason, nothing sticking out that might blow away in the harsh weather, but there was probably another reason,
not related to the climate, more a reflection of rural New England society back then, you see Cape Cod houses were not
built in the big cities, where all the rich people lived back then. These were modest dwellings, the people who built themsimply couldn’t afford lots of expensive decorative details. But it was more than just a matter of money. In these rural areas,
people depended on each other for survival. Neighbors had to help and support each other in a difficult environment, so you
didn't want to appear to be showing off. You’d want to avoid anything that might set you apart from your neighbors, the
same people you might need to help you someday. So all these help to create an attitude of conformity in the community,
and you can see why a modest, a very plain style would have become so widely imitated throughout rural New England.
Student 2
It is plain, but you know its nice looking.
Professor
Good point, and in fact it’s precisely that aesthetic appeal, the…the purity, the nearly perfect proportions of the
house…that’s another reason for the Cape Cod’s enduring popularity, even in places where the climate is so mild that its
functional design doesn't matter.

Narrator
Listen to a conversation between a student and a Professor.
94Student
Hi professor Atkins, you wanted to see me?
Professor
Hi Bill thanks for coming. I wanted to talk to you about …..
Student
Is there ... is there something wrong with my research paper?
Professor
No, not at all, in fact it's very good. That’s why I wanted to talk to you.
Student
Oh, thanks
Professor
I think you know the department is looking to hire a new professor, are you familiar with our hiring process?
Student
No, but what is that got to do with me?
Professor
Well, Bill, we have several qualified applicants we are serious about. And as part of the interview process, we have
them meet with a committee of professors and students in our department. They also have to give a talk.
Student
You mean like a lecture?
Professor
Yes, like a sample lecture on one of their academic interests
Student
Oh, so you can see their teaching style.
Professor
Exactly
Student
Uh-huh.…Make sense.
Professor
So I’d like to know if you’d be willing to join us as a student representatives on the interview committee. It’d be a
good experience for you. You could put it on your resume.
Student
Oh… that’d look good for my grad school application, I guess, so, what do I
have to do?
Professor
95The department secretary will give you a schedule of the applicants’ visits. If you are free, we’d like you to attend their
talks and then later you can give us your opinion. Oh, and we usually serve lunch or snacks depending on what time the talk
is.
Student
Cool, that’s another good reason to do this. Um… when is the next talk?
Professor
We actually haven't had any yet, the first one is next Friday, at 10 AM, then lunch, and then formal discussion with the
applicant right after.
Student
Oh well, I’m free on Fridays. If all the talks are on Fridays, I will be able to make it to all of them.
Professor
That’s great, now you should know that this job candidate is interested in the life cycles in the forest.
Student
That’s what my research about.
Professor
Yes, I know that’s why I feel it necessary to point out that even though this applicant’s research interests are similar to
yours; we want you to tell us what you think about the teaching of all these applicants. Your perspective as a student, how
the applicant teaches in the classroom, that what’s important to us.
Student
I understand. So how many applicants are there?
Professor
Let’s see, we have 4, all very good candidates, that we will be looking at over the next few weeks. It's going to be a
tough decision. But it'll be a good experience for you, especially if you’re going to grad school.
Student
Thank you. It’ll be cool to do this. I’ll get a copy of the schedule from the secretary on my way out.
Professor
You’re welcome, see you in class this afternoon
TPO11 Lecture 3 Environmental science
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an environmental science class.
Professor
When land gets developed for human use, the landscape changes. We don’t see as many types of vegetation, trees,
grasses and so forth. This in turn leads to other losses: the loss of animals that once lived there. Err…but these are the
96obvious changes, but there are also less obvious changes like the climate. One interesting case of this…uh…of changes in
the local land use causing changes in climate, specifically the temperature is in Florida. Now what comes to mind when you
think of the state of Florida?
Student A
Sunshine, beaches.
Student B
Warm weather, oranges…
Professor
Yes, exactly. Florida has long had a great citrus industry; large growth of oranges, lemons and the like. Florida’s winter
is very mild; the temperature doesn’t often get below freezing. But there are some areas of Florida that do freeze. So in the
early 1900s, farmers moved even further south in Florida, to areas that were even less likely to freeze. Obviously, freezing
temperatures are a danger to the crops. A bad bout of cold weather, a long spell of frosts could ruin a farmer’s entire crop,
anyway, before the citrus growers moved south, much of the land in south Florida, was what we called wetlands. Wetlands
are areas of marshy, swampy land, areas where water covers the soil, or is present either at or near the surface of the soil for
a large part of the year. Wetlands have their own unique ecosystems, with plants and animals with special and interesting
adaptations. Very exciting, but it’s not what we are talking about today. Emm…where was I?
Student A
Farmers moved south?
Professor
Oh, yes. Farmers moved south. But the land was not suitable for farming. You can’t grow oranges in wetlands, so
farmers had to transform the wetlands into land suitable for farming. To do that, you have to drain the water from the land,
move the water elsewhere, and divert the water sources such as rivers. Hundreds of miles of drainage canals were built in
the wetlands.
Now these areas, the new areas the farmers moved to, used to be warm and unlikely to freeze, however, recently the
area has become susceptible to freezes. And we are trying to understand why.
Student B
Is it some global temperature change or weather pattern like El Niño or something?
Professor
Well, there are two theories. One idea is as you suggest that major weather patterns, something like El Niño, are
responsible. But the other idea and this is the one that I personally subscribe to, is that the changes in the temperature
pattern have been brought about by the loss of the wetlands.
Student A
Well, how would loss of wetlands make a difference?
Professor
Well, think about what we’ve been studying so far. We’ve discussed the impact of landscapes on temperature, right?
What effects does a body of water have on an area?
Student A
Oh, yeah. Bodies of water tend to absorb the heat during the day, and then they release the heat at night.
97Professor
Yes, exactly. What you just said is what I want you all to understand. Bodies of water release heat and moisture back
into the environment. So places near large bodies of water are generally milder, err...slightly warmer than those without
water. And what I and others think is that the loss of the wetlands has created a situation where the local temperatures in the
area are now slightly different, slightly colder than they were 100 years ago, before the wetlands were drained.
Student B
Hmm…do we know what the temperature was like back then?
Professor
Well, we were able to estimate this. We have data about South Florida’s current landscape, uh…the plant cover. And
we were able to reconstruct data about its landscape prior to 1900. Then we enter those data, information about what the
landscape look like before and after the wetlands were drained. We enter the data into a computer weather model. This
model can predict temperatures. And when all of the data were entered, an overall cooling trend was predicted by the model.
Student B
How much colder does it get now?
Professor
Well, actually the model shows a drop of only a few degrees Celsius. But this is enough to cause dramatic damage to
crops. If temperatures overnight are already very close to the freezing point, then this drop of just a few degrees can take the
temperature below freezing. And freezing causes frosts, which kill crops. These damaging frosts wouldn’t happen if the
wetlands were still in existence, just a tiny temperature difference can have major consequences.
TPO11 Lecture 4 Business
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a Business Class.
Professor
Let's get started. Um, last time we were talking about the need for advertising. Now, let's look at how you can
successfully call attention to the service or product you want to sell. To succeed, you’ve got to develop a systematic
approach. If you don't come up with a system, um, a plan, you risk making decisions that waste money, or even drive away
potential customers.
But what
does a systematic advertising plan look like? Well, it covers what we call -- the ‘Four Ms’. The ‘Four Ms’: Market,
Media, Money, Message. All are important areas to focus on when creating your advertising plan. We will look at them one
by one.
The First step is to look at your Market, that’s the people who might become customers, buyers of your service or
product. You need to know all about your possible customers： Who are they？ What age group are they? What do they
like, or dislike? How do they shop? So, you got that? A market is a group of potential customers.
Next, Media… Obviously the major media are television, radio, newspapers, magazines, um, billboards, and so forth.
There are all avenues of communication. And you need to figure out: Which media you should advertise through? Which
98media will reach your intended audience -- your market? So, you do research, trying to determine which media will reach
the most potential customers for the lowest cost. For instance, if you have a product, that ... oh... say teachers would like,
then teachers are your market. So you ask yourself: What magazines do the majority of teachers read? What TV programs
do teachers watch? Do teachers listen to much radio? At what times of the day? Say, now your research turns up two
magazines that teachers read. And it also shows that the majority of teachers - say ages twenty to thirty - read the magazine
about classroom activities. While most teachers older than that read the other magazine, the one about, oh, let’s
say—‘Educational Psychology’. You think your product will appeal most to teachers ages twenty to thirty, so you decide to
put your advertisement in their favorite magazine, the one about classroom activities. You don't waste money advertising in
the ‘Educational Psychology’ magazine, you know the one that the younger teachers generally don't read. And since you’re
reaching the majority of the teachers in your target age group, you’re probably spending your money well, which bring us to
the third M -- Money.
You have an advertising budget to spend, but how do you to spend it wisely. Again, research is the key. Good research
gives you facts, facts that can help you decide, well, as we already mentioned, decide the right market to target, and the best
media to use. But also: When to advertise? or…or how to get the best rates? Like, maybe you’re advertising Sports
equipment, and you have been spending most of your budget during the holiday season when people buy gifts for each other.
Now, in theory, that would seem a great time to advertise, but maybe research shows that you’re wrong, that the customers
who buy sports equipment tend not to give it as a holiday gift, but want to use it themselves. In that case, advertising during
a different season of the year might give you better results. And, um, maybe at even lower, non-holiday rates, so you
actually save money. But you need to get the facts; facts that come from good research to be certain and know for sure that
you’re getting your money’s worth.
OK, finally, there is your message: What you want to say about your product? Why buying it will make the customer’s
life easier, or safer or better somehow. Whatever the message is, make sure you get it right.
Let me give you an example of not getting it right, Ha...ha...ha... you are going to love this one: There was this Soup
Shop, the soup was really tasty, but there weren't a lot of customers. The owner thought that maybe if they gave something
away for free with each purchase, then more people would come buy soup. So they got some cheap socks, and they
advertised to give a pair away with each bowl of soup. But, then even fewer people came to the restaurant. Well, you can
imagine why. People started to associate the soup with feet; they began to imagine the soup smelled like feet. The
advertising message, soup means free socks, was a bad choice; it was a waste of money. And worse, it caused the loss of
customers.
Now, I want everyone to get into small groups and come up with some examples, not of good advertising messages,
but of truly disastrous ones. Think of real examples or make some up, and talk about the reasons those messages are
unsuccessful. And then we’ll get back together and share.

Student
So Professor Tibbits, your notes said that you wanted to see me about my Hemingway paper. I have to say that grade
wasn’t what I was expecting. I thought I’d done a pretty good job.
99Professor
Oh, you did. But do you really want to settle for pretty good when you can do
something very good?
Student
You think it can be very good?
Professor
Absolutely!
Student
Would that mean you’d…I could get a better grade?
Professor
Oh, sorry! It’s not for your grade. It's…I think you could learn a lot by revising it.
Student
You mean, rewrite the whole thing? I’m really swamped. There’s deadlines wherever I turn and… and I don’t really
know how much time I could give it.
Professor
Well, it is a busy time, with spring break coming up next week. It’s your call.
But I think that with a little extra effort, you can really turn this into a fine essay.
Student
No… yeah…I mean, after I read your comments, I...I can see how it tries to do
too much.
Professor
Yeah. It’s just too ambitious for the scope of the assignment.
Student
So I should cut out the historical part?
Professor
Yes. I would just stick to the topic. Anything unrelated to the use of nature imagery has no place in the paper. All that
tangential material just distracts from the main argument.
Student
Yeah, I never know how much to include. You know…where to draw the line?
Professor
Tell me about it! All writers struggle with that one. But it’s something you can learn. That will become more clear with
practice. But I think if you just cut out the…um…
Student
The stuff about the history, but if I cut out those sections, won’t it be too short?
100Professor
Well, better a short well-structured paper than a long paper that’s poorly structured and wanders off topic.
Student
So all I have to do is delete those sections?
Professor
Well, not so fast. After you cut out those sections, you’ll have to go back and revise the rest, to see how it all fits
together. And of course, you’ll have to revise the introduction too, to accurately describe what you do in the body of the
paper. But that shouldn’t be too difficult. Just remember to keep the discussion focused. Do you think you can get it to me
by noon tomorrow?
Student
Wow…um…I have so much…er…but I’ll try.
Professor
OK, good! Do try! But if you can’t, well, shoot for after spring break, OK?
TPO12 Lecture 1 Biology
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a Biology Class.
Professor
As we learn more about the DNA in human cells and how it controls the growth and development of cells, then maybe
we can explain a very important observation, that when we try to grow most human cells in a laboratory, they seemprogrammed to divide only a certain number of times before they die.
Now this differs with the type of cell. Some cells, like nerve cells, only divide seven to nine times in their total life.
Others, like skin cells, will divide many, many more times. But finally the cells stop renewing themselves and they die. And
in the cells of the human body itself, in the cells of every organ, of almost every type of tissue in the body, the same thing
will happen eventually.
OK, you know that all of a person’s genetic information is contained on very long pieces of DNA called Chromosomes.
46 of them are in the human cells, that’s 23 pairs of these Chromosomes of various lengths and sizes.
Now if you’ll look at this rough drawing of one of them, one Chromosome about to divide into two. You see that it sort
of looks like, well actually it’s much more complex than this, but it reminds us a couple of springs linked together, two
coiled up pieces of DNA. And if you stretch them out you will find they contain certain genes, certain sequences of DNA
that help determine how the cells of the body will develop. When researchers look really carefully at the DNA in
Chromosomes though, they were amazed, we all were, to find that only a fraction of it, maybe 20-30%, converts into
meaningful genetic information. It’s incredible; at least it was to me. But if you took away all the DNA that codes for genes,
you still have maybe 70% of the DNA left over. That’s the so-called JUNK DNA. Though the word junk is used sort of
tongue-in-cheek.
The assumption is that even if this DNA doesn’t make up any of the genes, it must serve some other purpose. Anyway,
if we examine these ends of these coils of DNA, we will find a sequence of DNA at each end of every human Chromosome,
101called a telomere.
Now a telomere is a highly repetitious and genetically meaningless sequence of DNA, what we were calling JUNK
DNA. But it does have an important purpose; it is sort of like the plastic tip on each end of a shoelace. It may not help you
tie your shoe but that little plastic tip keeps the rest of the shoelace, the shoe string from unraveling into weak and useless
threads. Well, the telomeres at the ends of Chromosomes seem to do about the same thing--- protect the genes, the
genetically functional parts of the Chromosome, from being damaged. Every time the Chromosome divides, every time one
cell divides into two. Pieces of the ends of the Chromosome, the telomeres, get broken off. So after each division, the
telomeres get shorter and one of the things that may happen after a while is that pieces of the genes themselves get broken
off the Chromosomes. So the Chromosome is now losing important genetic information and is no longer functional. But as
long as the telomeres are a certain length, they keep this from happening. So it seems that, when the, by looking at the
length of the telomeres on specific Chromosomes, we can actually predict pretty much how long certain cells can
successfully go on dividing.
Now, there are some cells that just seem to keep on dividing regardless, which may not always be a good thing if it gets
out of control.
But when we analyze these cells chemically, we find something very interesting, a chemical in them, an enzyme called
telomerase. As bits of the telomere break off from the end of the Chromosome, this chemical, this telomerase can rebuild it,
can help reassemble the protective DNA, the telomere that the Chromosome has lost. Someday we may be able to take any
cell and keep it alive functioning and reproducing itself essentially forever through the use of telomerase. And in the future
we may have virtually immortal nerve cells and immortal skin cells or whatever, because this chemical, telomerase, can
keep the telomeres on the ends of Chromosomes from getting any shorter.
TPO12 Lecture 2 Business
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a Business Class
Professor
Ok, as we’ve talked about a key aspect of running a successful business is knowing, um, getting a good sense of what
the customer actually wants, and how they perceive your product. So with that in mind, I want to describe a very simple
method of researching customer preference, and it is becoming increasingly common, it's called----MBWA----which stands
for managing by wandering around. Now, MBWA, that's not the most technical sounding name you've ever heard, but it
describes the process pretty accurately. Here is how it works.
Basically, Um, the idea is that business owners or business managers just go out and actually talk to their customers,
and learn more about how well the business is serving their needs, and try to see what the customer experiences, because
that's a great way to discover for yourself, how your product is perceived, what its strengths and weaknesses are, you know,
how you can improve it... that sort of thing. You know Dortans, they make soup and canned vegetables and such. Well, the
head of the company had Dortans’ top executives walk around supermarkets, um, asking shoppers what they thought of
Dortans’ soups, and he used that data to make changes to the company's product, I mean, when Dortans of all the companies,
embraces something as radical as MBWA, it really shows you how popular the theory has become, yes, Lisa?
Student A
But isn’t it dangerous to base decisions on information from a small sample of people? Isn’t large scale market
research safer getting data on a lot of people?
102Professor
That's a good question, and well I don't want to pretend that W… MBWA is some sort of, um, replacement for other
methods of customer research. Now, market research data definitely can give you a good idea of, um, of the big picture, but
MBWA is really useful, it kind of filling in the blanks, you know, getting a good underground sense of how your products
are used, and how people need to respond to them, and Yes, the numbers of opinion you get is small so you do need to be
careful, but, good business managers will tell you that the big fear they have and.. .and one of the most frequent problems
they come across is well becoming out of touch with what their customers really want and need, you know, surveys and
market research stuff like that, they can only tell you so much about what the customers actually want in their day-to-day
lives. Managing by wandering around, on the other hand, well, that gets you in there and gives you a good sense of what
customers need. So ... so when using combination then, MBWA and market research, well, they are powerful tools.
Oh, here is another example for you, uh, senior executives for a clothing manufacturer. It was, um, Lken, Lken jeans
you know, they went and worked in a store for a few days, selling Lken's cloths. Now that gave them a very different idea
about their product, they saw how people responded to it; they could go up to customers in the store and ask them questions
about it, uh, yes Mike?
Student B
Well, I would think that a lot of customers would be bothered by, you know, if I'm shopping, I don't know if I’d want
some business representative coming up to me and asking me questions, it's.. It's like when I get phone calls at home frommarket researchers, I just hang up on them Professor Oh, well, it's certainly true that well no one likes getting calls at home
from market researchers or people like that, but I will tell you something. Most customers have the exact opposite reaction
when it comes to MBWA. Now, don't ask me why, because I really have no idea, but the fact is that customers tend to
respond really well to MBWA, which is the key reason for its success.
In fact, the techniques of MBWA work so well, they have actually been extended to all kinds of different contexts, like
politics for instance, Um, a few years back, the mayor of Baltimore, Um.. I think his name was Sheaffer or something like
that. Anyway, he decided that the best way to serve the people of the city, of his city, was to actually get out there in it and
experience the things that they experienced, so he’d ride around the city in, well, you know, in all parts of it, and he’d see all
the potholes; he’d see how the trash was sometimes, um, not picked up off the side of the street and then he’d go back to his
office and he’d write these memos, now they were memos to his staff about the problems he had seen, and how they needed
to be fixed, you know that sort of thing, but the thing is he got all this information just by going around and seeing the
different Baltimore neighborhoods and talking to the people in them. Now he called it--- smart politics, we'd call it MBWA,
or just, playing good customer service.

Hi Brad, how are you?
Student
103I’m fine; except I have a question about my paycheck.
Secretary
Sure. What’ up?
Student
Well it’s already been several weeks into the semester and my paycheck was supposed to go directly into my bank
account, but there haven’t been any deposits.
Secretary
That’s odd.
Student
Yea, I thought graduate teaching assistants will automatically put on the payroll at the beginning of the semester.
Secretary
They are. Let’s see did you complete all the forms for payroll?
Student
I filled in whatever they sent me, and I returned like at the end of
August.
Secretary
Hmm, well, you definitely should have been paid by now. At least two pay periods have passed since then.
Student
I asked the bank and they didn’t know anything. Who should I talk to about this, payroll?
Secretary
I’m going to contact them for you. There was a problem in processing some of the graduate student payroll paperwork.
‘Cause their computer program crashed after all the information was processed. And some people’s information couldn’t be
retrieved.
Student
Oh. But why didn’t anyone let me know?
Secretary
I don’t know how they work over there, ‘cause they couldn’t even figure out whose information was missing. And this
isn’t the first time, seems like something like this happens every semester.
Student
So how do I find out if my information was lost?
Secretary
I will contact them tomorrow morning to see if you’re in the system.
But you’re probably not.
Student
Well, then, what will I need to do?
104Secretary
Sorry but you will need to fill out those forms again and then I will fax
them over to the payroll office.
Student
And then what… Well, what I really need to know is how long till I get some money, I’m already a month behind in
my bills and my tuition’s due soon.
Secretary
They’ll get you into the system the same day they receive your paperwork.
So if you do that tomorrow, you’ll get paid next Friday.
Student
That’s a long time from now. Will that paycheck include all the money I am owed?
Secretary
It should. I will double check with the payroll department.
Student
And another thing, Is there any way I could get paid sooner, I have been teaching all these weeks…
Secretary
I know it’s not fair but I don’t think they can do anything; all the checks are computed automatically in the system.
They can’t just write checks.
Student
But they are the ones that made a mistake. And they never told me!
Woman
I understand how you feel. If I were you, I’d be upset too. I’ll tell you what: when I call them, I will explain the
situation and ask if there is any way you could be paid sooner. But I have to tell you that based on past experiences you
shouldn’t count on it.
Student
(Sigh) I understand thanks. I know it’s’ not your fault and that you’re
doing everything you can.
Secretary
Well, what I CAN do is make sure that your first check for the total amount that the university owes you.
Student
That’ll be great! Thank you. I will be on campus about 10 tomorrow morning and I will come by to see you then.
TPO 12 Lecture 3 Music history
Narrator
105Listen to part of a lecture in a music history class. The professor has been
discussing Opera.
Professor
The word opera means work, actually it means works. It’s the plural of the word opus from the Latin. And in Italian it
refers in general to works of art. Opera Lyrica or lyric opera refers to what we think of as opera, the musical drama.
Opera was commonplace in Italy for almost a thousand years before it became commercial as a venture. And during
those years, several things happened, primarily linguistic or thematic and both involving secularization.
Musical drama started in the churches. It was an educational tool. It was used primarily as a vehicle for teaching
religion and was generally presented in Latin, the language of the Christian Church which had considerable influence in
Italy at that time. But the language of everyday life was evolving in Europe and at a certain point in the middle ages it was
really only merchants, aristocrats and clergy who could deal with Latin. The vast majority of the population used their own
regional vernacular in all aspects of their lives. And so in what is now Italy, operas quit being presented in Latin and started
being presented in Italian.
And once that happened, the themes of the opera presentations also started to change. And musical drama moved fromthe church to the plaza right outside the church. And the themes again, the themes changed. And opera was no longer about
teaching religion as it was about satire and about expressing the ideas of society or government without committing yourself
to writing and risking imprisonment or persecution, or what have you.
Opera, as we think of it, is of course a resurrected form. It is the melodious drama of ancient Greek theater, the term‘melodious drama’ being shortened eventually to ‘melodrama’ because operas frequently are melodramatic, not to say
unrealistic. And the group that put the first operas together that we have today then, were, well…it was a group of men that
included Galileo’s father Vincenzo, and they met in Florence he and a group of friends of the count of Bardi and they
formed what is called the Camerata dei Bardi. And they took classical theater and reproduced it in the Renaissance time.
This…uh…this produced some of the operas that we have today.
Now what happened in the following century is very simple. Opera originated in Italy but was not confined to Italy any
more than Italians were. And so as Italians migrated across Europe, they carried theater with them and opera specifically
because it was an Italian form.
What happened is that the major divide in opera that endures today took place. The French said opera ought to reflect
the rhythm and cadence of dramatic literature, bearing in mind that we are talking about the golden age in French literature.
And so the music was secondary, if you will, to the dramatic cadence of language, to the way the rhythm of language was
used to express feeling and used to add drama and of course as a result instead of arias or solos, which would come to
dominate Italian opera. The French relied on what the Italians called recitativo or recitative in English. The lyrics were
spoken, frequently to the accompaniment of a harpsichord.
The French said you really can’t talk about real people who lived in opera and they relied on mythology to give themtheir characters and their plots, mythology, the pastoral traditions, the novels of chivalry or the epics of chivalry out of the
middle Ages. The Italians said, no this is a great historical tool and what better way to educate the public about Nero or
Attila or any number of people than to put them into a play they can see and listen to.
The English appropriated opera after the French. Opera came late to England because all theaters, public theaters were
closed, of course, during their civil war. And it wasn’t until the restoration in 1660 that public theaters again opened and
opera took off. The English made a major adjustment to opera and exported what they had done to opera back to Italy.
106So that you have this circle of musical influences, the Italians invented opera, the French adapted it, the English
adopted it, the Italians took it back.
It came to America late and was considered to elitist for the general public. But Broadway musicals fulfilled a similar
function for a great long while.
John Jay Chapman wrote about opera, quote, “If an extraterrestrial being were to appear before us and say, what is your
society like, what is this Earth thing all about, you could do worse than take that creature to an opera.” End quote. Because
opera does, after all, begin with a man and a woman and an emotion.

Professor
All right folks, let’s continue our discussion of alternative energy sources and move on to what’s probably the most
well-known alternative energy source--- solar energy. The sun basically provides Earth with virtually unlimited source of
energy everyday, but the problem has always been how do we tap this source of energy. Can anyone think of why it’s so
difficult to make use of solar energy?
Student A
Because it is hard to gather it?
Professor
That’s exactly it. Solar energy is everywhere, but it’s also quite diffused. And the thing is the dream of solar energy is
not a new one. Humanity has been trying to use the sun’s light as a reliable source of energy for centuries. And around the
beginning of the 20th century there were actually some primitive solar water heaters on the consumer market. But they
didn’t sell very well. Any of you wanna guess why?
Student A
Well, there were other energy choices like oil and natural gas, right?
Professor
Yeah. And for better or for worse, we chose to go down that path as a society. When you consider economic factors, it’s
easy to see why. But then in the 1970s, there was an interest in solar energy again. Why do you think that happened?
Student B
Because oil and natural gas were...err...became scarce?
Professor
Well, not exactly. The amount of oil and natural gas in the Earth was still plentiful, but there were other reasons. It’s a
political thing really and I’m gonna get into that now. So what happened in the 1970s was oil and natural gas became very
expensive very quickly, and that spurred people to start looking into alternative forms of energy, solar energy probably
being the most popular. But then in the 80s, this trend reversed itself when the price of oil and natural gas went down.
Alright, let’s shift our focus now to some of the technologies that have been invented to overcome the problem of
107gathering diffused solar energy. The most basic solution is simply to carefully place windows in a building, so that the sun
shines into the building and then it’s absorbed and converted into heat. Can anyone think of where this is most commonly
used?
Student A
Greenhouses.
Professor
Yep, greenhouses where plants are kept warm and provided with sunlight, because the walls of the building are made
entirely of glass. But we do also have more complex systems that are used for space heating and they fall into two
categories, passive and active heating systems.
Passive systems take advantage of the location or design of a house. For example, solar energy is gathered through
large glass panels facing the sun. The heat is then stored in water-filled tanks or concrete. No mechanical devices are used in
passive heating systems. They operate with little or no mechanical assistance.
With active systems, on the other hand, you collect the solar energy at one location, and then you use pumps and fans
to move heat from the collectors through a plumbing system to a tank, where it can be used to heat a home or to just provide
hot water.
Student B
Excuse me, professor, but I’ve got to ask, how can solar energy work at night or on cloudy days?
Professor
That’s...Well...that is a really good question. As a matter of facts, science is still working on it, trying to find ways of
enhancing energy storage techniques so that the coming of night or cloudy days really wouldn’t matter. That is the biggest
drawback to solar energy. The problem of what do you do in cases where the sun’s light is weak or virtually non-present. So
the storage of solar energy, lots of solar energy, is a really important aspect.
Student A
Does that mean that solar energy can only be used on a small scale, like heating a home?
Professor
Well actually, there have been some attempts to build solar energy power plants. The world’s largest solar power plant
is located in Kremer Junction California. It can generate 194 megawatts of electric power, but that’s just a drop in the bucket.
Right now the utility companies are interested in increasing the capacity of the Kremer Junction Plant, but only time will
tell if it will ever develop into a major source of power for that region, considering the economic and political factors
involved.

Conversation 1
Narrator
Listen to a conversation between a student and his psychology professor.
Professor:
Good afternoon, Alex, can I help you with something?
108Student:
Well, I wanted to talk with you about the research project you assigned today. I um…I hope you could clarify a few
things for me.
Professor:
I’ll certainly try.
Student:
Ok, all we have to do is do two observations and take notes on them, right?
Professor:
Ur, that’s a start, but you’ll need to do some research, too. Then you will write a paper that is not so much about the
observations, but a synthesis of what you have observed and read.
Student:
Ok….And what about the children I am supposed to observe?
Professor:
Not children, a single child observed twice.
Student:
Oh…Ok, so I should choose a child with the permission of the child’s parent of course and then observe that child a
couple of times and take good notes, then?
Professor:
Actually after your first observation, you’ll go back and look through your textbook or go to a library and find a few
sources concerning the stage of development this particular child is in. And then, with that knowledge, you will make a
second observation of the same child to see if the expected developmental behaviors are exhibited.
Student:
Can you give me an example?
Professor:
Well, um, if you observed a four-year-old child, for example, my daughter is 4 years old; you might read up on Piaget’s
stages of cognitive development we covered those in class.
Student:
Uh-huh.
Professor:
Uh, most likely, what stage would a child of that age be in?
Student:
Um… the pre-operational stage?
Professor:
Exactly, if that’s the case, her language use would be maturing and her memory and imagination would be developed.
109Student:
So she might play pretend like she can pretend when driving her toy car across a couch that the couch is actually a
bridge or something.
Professor:
That is right. In addition, her thinking would be primarily egocentric.
Student:
So she would be thinking mostly about herself and her own needs, and might not be able to see things from anyone
else’s perspective?
Professor:
Hmm..huh.
Student:
But what if she doesn’t? I mean, what if she doesn’t demonstrate those behaviors?
Professor:
That’s fine; you’ll note that in your paper. See, your paper should compare what is expected of children at certain
stages of development with what you actually observed.
Student:
Ok, I have one more question now.
Professor:
And what’s that?
Student:
Where can I find a child to observe?
Professor:
Um, I suggest you contact the education department secretary. She has a list of contacts at various schools and with
certain families who are somehow connected to the university. Sometimes they are willing to help out students with projects
like yours.
Student:
Ok, I’ll stop by the education department office this afternoon.
Professor:
And if you have any trouble or any more questions, feel free to come by during my office hours.
TPO 13 Lecture 1 City planning
Narrator:
Listen to part of a lecture in a city planning class.
Professor:
110In the last 50 years or so, many American cities have had difficulties in maintaining a successful retail environment.
Business owners in the city centers or the downtown areas have experienced some financial losses, because of a steady
movement of people out of the cities and into the suburbs. In general, downtown areas, just don’t have that many residential
areas, not that many people live there. So what have city planners decided to do about it? Well, one way they’ve come up
with some ways to attract more people, to shop downtown was by creating pedestrian malls.
Now, what is a pedestrian mall? It’s a pretty simple concept really, it is essentially an outdoor shopping area designed
just for people on foot. And… well, unlike many other shopping malls that are built in the suburbs nowadays, these
pedestrian malls are typically located in the downtown area of the city. And...oh... there are features like white sidewalks,
comfortable outdoor seating and maybe even fountains, and... you know, art. There are variations on this model of course,
but the common denominator is always the idea of creating a shopping space that will get people to shop in the city without
needing their cars. So I am sure you can see how having an area that’s off-limits to automobile traffic would be ideal for a
heavily populated city where, well, the streets would otherwise be bustling with noisy, unpleasant traffic congestion.
Now the
concept which originated in Europe was adopted by American city planners in the late 1950s. And since then, a number
of Unites States’ cities have created pedestrian malls. And many of them have been highly successful. So what have city
planners learned about making these malls succeed?
Well, there are two critical factors to consider when creating a pedestrian mall--- location and design. Both of which
are equally important. Now let's start with the location. In choosing a specific location for a pedestrian mall, there are in fact
two considerations. Proximity to potential customers, um…that's we’d call a customer base and accessibility to public
transportation which we will get to in just a moment.
Now, for a customer base, the most obvious example would be a large office building since the employees could
theoretically go shopping after work or during their lunch hour, right? Another really good example is convention center
which typically has a hotel and large meeting spaces to draw visitors to the city for major business conferences and events.
But ideally, the pedestrian mall would be used by local residents, not just people working in the city or visiting the area. So
that's where access to public transportation comes in, either ...um...either the designers plan to locate the mall near a central
transportation hub, like a bus terminal, a major train or subway station or they work with city officials to create sufficient
parking areas, not too far from the mall, which makes sense because if people can’t drive into the mall area, well, then they
need to have easy access to it. OK, so that's location, but ... but what about design? Well, design doesn't necessarily include
things like sculptures or decorative walkways or… or even eye-catching window displays, you know, art. Although I would
be the first to admit those things are aesthetically appealing, however, visually pleasing sights, well, they are not a part of
the pedestrian mall design that matter than most. The key consideration is a compact and convenient layout. One which
allows pedestrians to walk from one end of the mall to the other in just a few minutes, so they can get to the major stores,
resaurants and other central places without having to take more than one or two turns. Now, this takes careful and creative
planning.
But now what if one ingredient to this planning recipe is missing? There could quite possibly be long-lasting effects.
And I think a good example is the pedestrian mall in the Louisville Kentucky for instance. Now when the Louisville mall
was built, oh, it had lots of visual appeal, it was attractively designed, right in the small part of downtown and it pretty much
possessed all of the other design elements for success. But ... uh, now, here is where my point about location comes into
play. There wasn't a convention center around to ... to help draw in visitors, and well, the only nearby hotel eventually
closed down for that same reason. Well, you can imagine how this must have affected local and pedestrian mall business
owners. Sort of what was we call a chain reaction. It wasn't until a convention center and a parking garage were built about
a decade later that the mall started to be successful.
111TPO 13 Lecture 2 Ecology
Narrator:
Listen to part of a lecture in an ecology class.
Professor:
So, continuing our discussion of ecological systems--- whole systems. The main thing to keep in mind here is the
interrelationships. The species in a system uh…. and even the landscape itself, they are interdependent. Let’s take what you
read for this week and see if we can apply this interdependence idea. Mike?
Student:
Well, um…, how about beavers--- ecosystems with beavers and waterways.
Professor:
Good, good, go on.
Student:
Like, well, you can see how it's so important, ‘cause if you go back before European settled in north America, like
before the 1600s, back when native Americans were the only people living here, well, back then there were a lot of beavers,
but later on, after Europeans…
Professor:
OK, wait, I see where you are heading with this, but before we go into how European settlement affected the
ecosystem, tell me this--- what kind of environment do beavers live in? Think about what it was like before the Europeans
settlers came, we’ll come back to where you were headed.
Student:
OK, well, beavers live near streams and rivers and they block up the streams and rivers with like logs and sticks and
mud. You know, they build dams that really slow down the flow of the stream. So then the water backs up, and creates like a
pond that floods the nearby land.
Professor:
And that creates wetlands. OK, tell me more.
Student:
Well with wetlands, it's like there is more standing water, more still water around, and that water is a lot cleaner than
swiftly flowing water, because the dirt and sediment and stuff has a chance to sink to the bottom.
Professor:
More important for our discussion, wetland areas support a lot more varieties of life than swiftly flowing water. For
example, there are more varieties of fish, or insects, lots of frog spices, and then species that rely on those species start to
live near the wetlands too.
Student:
Yes, like birds and mammals that eat the fish and insects, and you get trees and plants that begin to grow near the
standing water that can't grow near the running water. Oh, and there's something about wetlands and groundwater too.
Professor: OK, good. Wetlands have a big effect on groundwater, the amount of water below the surface of the land.
112Think of wetlands as, Umm, like a giant sponge, the earth soaks up a lot of this water that's continually flooding the surface,
which increases the amount of water below. So where there’re wetlands, you get a lot of groundwater, and groundwater
happens to be a big source of our own drinking water today.
Alright… So, back to the beavers, what if the beavers weren't there?
Student:
You just have a regular running stream, because there is no dam, so the ecosystem would be completely different, there
would be fewer wetlands.
Professor:
Exactly, so, now let's go back to where you were headed before, Mike. You mentioned a change that occurred after
Europeans came to North America.
Student:
Yeah, well, there used to be beavers all over the place, something like 200 million beavers, just in the continental
United States. But when Europeans came, they started hunting the beavers for their fur, because beaver fur is really warm,
and it was really popular for making hats in Europe. So the beavers were hunted a lot, overhunted, they are almost extinct
by the 1800s, so… that meant fewer wetlands, less standing water.
Professor:
And what does that mean for the ecosystem? Kate?
Student:
Well if there is less standing water, then the ecosystem can’t support as many species, because a lot of insects and fish
and frogs can't live in running water, and then the birds and animals that eat them, lose their food supply.
Professor:
Precisely, so the beaver in this ecosystem is what we call a keystone species. The term keystone kind of explains itself.
In architecture, a keystone in an archway or doorway is the stone that holds the whole thing together, and keeps it fromcollapsing. Well, that's what a keystone species does in an ecosystem. It's the crucial species that keeps the system going.
Now, beaver populations are on the rise again, but there is something to think about. Consider humans as part of these
ecosystems, you've probably heard about water shortages or restrictions on how much water you can use, especially in the
summer time, in recent years. And remember what I said about groundwater; imagine if we still have all those beavers
around, all those wetlands. What would our water supply be like then?
TPO 13 Conversation 2
Narrator:
Listen to a conversation between a student and the language lab manager.
Student:
Hi, I'm not sure, but um... is this the Carter language lab?
Manager:
Yes, it is. How can I help you?
113Student:
I'm taking first year Spanish this semester. Our professor says we need to come here to view a series of videos. I think
it is called Spanish-- Working on Your Accent?
Manager:
Yes, we have that. Um....They are on the wall behind you.
Student:
OK. So, I can just take....err.....Can I take the whole series home? I think there are
three of them.
Manager:
I guess you haven't been here before.
Student:
No, no I haven't.
Manager:
Ok, well, you have to watch the videos here. You need to sign in to reserve an open room and sign out the video you
need, just start with the first one in the series, each video is half an hour long.
Student:
So, it is a video library, basically?
Manager:
Yes, but unlike the library, you can't take any videos out of the lab.
Student:
OK, so how long can I use a video room for?
Manager:
You can sign up for two hours at a time.
Student:
Oh, good, so I can watch more than one video when I come up here. Is the lab pretty busy all the time?
Manager:
Well, rooms are usually full right after dinner time, but you can sign up the day before to reserve a room if you want.
Student:
Err...the day before....But, I can just stop in too, to see if there’s any rooms open, right?
Manager:
Sure, stop in any time.
Student:
What about copies of the videos? Is there just one copy of each in the series?
I don't want to miss out if everyone comes in at once.
Manager:
114Oh, no, we have several copies of each tape in the Spanish Accent series. We usually have multiple copies of
everything for each video collection.
Student:
Super. So...how many rooms are there total in the lab?
Manager:
20. They are pretty small. So, we normally get one person or no more than a small group of people in there watching a
video together. Actually, someone else from your class just came in and took the first Spanish video in to watch. You could
probably run in there and watch it with him. Of course, you are welcome to have own room. But, sometimes students like to
watch with a classmate, so they can review the material with each other afterwards. For example, if there was some content
they didn't really understand.
Student:
I guess I prefer my own room. I concentrate better by myself and I don't want to miss anything, you know, and he’s
probably already started watching it...
Manager:
No problem, we've got a lot of rooms open right now. When you come in, you sign your name on the list and you’re
assign a room number, or if you call in advance, then the attendant will tell you your room number, if you forget, just come
in and take a look at the list. The videos are over there.
Student:
Great, thanks.
TPO 13 Lecture 3 Poetry
Narrator:
Listen to part of a lecture in a poetry class, the professor is discussing
medieval poetry.
Professor:
OK, so the two poems we are looking at today fall into the category of ... uh ... medieval
times, which was how long ago?
Student:
Almost a thousand years ago, right?
Professor:
Yes, that’s right.
Student:
But, professor, are you sure these are poems? I mean I thought poems were shorter; these are more like long stories. I
mean one of them was all about love, but the other one, the Chan…Chan…whatever it’s called, the other one; well, it was
all about fighting and battles. I mean can both of them be considered poems?
Professor:
115Well, think back to the very beginning of this course.
Student:
Uh-huh.
Professor:
Remember how we, we define poetry? In the very broadest sense, we said it’s written to evoke, to make you, the
audience, have some kind of the emotional experience through the use of imagery, um, some kind of predictable rhythm.
And usually, but not always, there’s more than one meaning implied with the words that are used.
Let’s start with the Chanson poetry first. That’s Chanson. Chanson poems became popular in Europe, particularly in
France, and the term is actually short for a longer French phrase that translates to um ... uh… songs of deeds.
Now, they were called songs of deeds because strangely enough, they were written to describe the heroic deeds or
actions of warriors, the knights during conflicts. We don’t know a lot about the authors, it’s still contested somewhat. But
we are pretty sure about who the Chanson poems were written for. That is---they were written for knights and the lords---the
nobility that they served. The poems were sung, performed by a minstrel, a singer who travelled from castle to castle,
singing to the local lord and his knights. Uh… well, would someone summarize the main features of the Chanson poem you
read?
Student:
Well, there’s a hero, a knight, who goes to battle, and he is admired for his courage, bravery and loyalty, loyalty to the
lord he serves, his country and his fellow warriors in the field. He’s ....um... he has a, he’s a skilled fighter, willing to face
the most extreme dangers, sacrificial, willing to sacrifice anything and everything to protect his king and country.
Professor:
Ok, now, given that the intended audience for these poems were knights and lords. What can we say about the purpose
of Chanson poetry? What kinds of feelings was it meant to provoke?
Student:
I guess they must’ve been really appealing to those knights and lords who were listening to them. Hearing the songs
probably made them feel more patriotic, made them feel like it was a good and noble thing to serve their countries in
whatever way they could.
Professor:
Good, we’ve got a pretty good picture of what the Chanson hero was like. Now let’s compare that to the hero in the
other poem. The other poem is an example of what’s called Romance Poetry. And the hero in the Romance poem was also a
knight. But what made the knight in Romance Poetry different from the knight in Chanson poetry?
Well, first the purpose of the hero’s actions was different. The hero in Romance Poetry is independent, purely solitary
in a way, not like the Chanson poet who was always surrounded by his fighting companions. He doesn’t engage in conflict
to protect his lord or country. He does it for the sake of adventure, to improve himself, to show he’s worthy of respect and
love from his lady. He’s very conscious of the particular rules of social behavior he has to live up to somehow. And all of his
actions are for the purpose of proving that he is an upright, moral, well-mannered, well-behaved individual. You may have
noticed that in Chanson poetry, there isn’t much about the hero’s feelings. The focus is on the actions, the deeds. But the
Romance Poetry describes a lot of the inner feelings, the motivations, psychology you could say, of a knight trying to
improve himself, to better himself, so that he’s worthy of the love of a woman.
What explains this difference? Well, uh, digging into the historical context tells us a lot. Romance Poetry emerged a
116few generations after Chanson, and its roots were in geographic regions of France that were calmer, where conflict wasn’t
central to people’s lives. More peaceful times meant there was more time for education, travel, more time for reflection.
Another name for Romance Poetry that’s often synonymous with it is troubadour poetry.
Troubadours were the authors of these new Romance poems. And we know a lot more about the troubadours than we
do about the Chanson authors, because they often had small biographical sketches added to their poems that gave pretty
specific information about their social status, geographical location and a small outline of their career. These information
wasn’t particularly reliable because they were sometimes based on fictitious stories of great adventure or scraped together
from parts of different poems. But there is enough there to squeeze or infer some facts about their social class. The political
climate had settled down enough so that troubadours had the luxury of being able to spend most if not all of their time,
creating, crafting or composing their love songs for their audiences. And yes these poems were also sung; many troubadours
were able to make a living being full-time poets which should tell you something about the value of that profession during
medieval times.
TPO 13 Lecture 4 Astronomy
Narrator:
Listen to part of a lecture in an astronomy class.
Professor:
OK, I wanna go over the different types of meteorites, and what we've learned from them about the formation of Earth,
and the solar system. Uh… the thing is what's especially interesting about meteorites is that they come from interplanetary
space, but they consist of the same chemical elements that are in matter originating on Earth, just in different proportions.
But that makes it easier to identify something as a meteorite, as opposed to…to just a terrestrial rock.
So to talk about where meteorites come from, we need to talk about comets and asteroids, which basically...they’re
basically made up of debris left over from the origin of the solar system 4.6 billion years ago.
Now I'm going a bit out of a order here…um…I'm not going to go into any depth on comets and asteroids now, but
we'll come back later and do that. For now, I'll just cover some basic info about them.
OK, comets and asteroids. It might help if you think of...remember we talked about the two classes of planets in our
solar system? And how they differ in composition? The terrestrial planets--like Mars and Earth--composed largely of rocks
and metals, and the large gas giants, like Jupiter. Well, the solar system also has two analogous classes of objects, smaller
than planets--namely, asteroids and comets.
Relatively near the sun, in the inner solar system, between Jupiter and Mars to be precise, we’ve got the asteroid belt,
which contains about 90 percents of all asteroids orbiting the sun. These asteroids are…uh…like the terrestrial planets, in
that they're composed mostly of rocky material and metals.
Far from the sun, in the outer solar system, beyond Jupiter's orbit, temperatures are low enough to permit ices to formout of water and…and out of gases like methane and carbon dioxide. Loose collections of these ices and small rocky
particles form into comets. So comets are similar in composition to the gas giants.
Both comets and asteroids are...typically are smaller than planets. An even smaller type of interplanetary debris is the
meteoroid. And it's from meteoroids that we get meteors and meteorites. "Roids" are, for the most part anyway, they are just
smaller bits of asteroids and comets. When these bits enter Earth’s atmosphere, well, that makes them so special that they
117get a special name. They're called meteors. Most of them are very small, and they burn up soon after entering Earth’s
atmosphere. The larger ones that make it through the atmosphere and hit the ground are called meteorites. So meteorites are
the ones that actually make it through.
Now we've been finding meteorites on Earth for thousands of years, and we've analyzed enough of them to learn a lot
about their composition, most come from asteroids, though a few may have come from comets. So essentially they are rocks,
and like rocks, they're mixtures of minerals. They are generally classified into three broad categories--stones, stony irons
and irons.
Stone meteorites, which we refer to simply as, uh, stones, are almost entirely rock material. They actually account for
almost all of the meteorite material that falls to earth. But even so, it's rare to ever find one. I mean, it's easier to find an iron
meteorite or a stony iron. Anyone guess why? Look at their names. What do you think iron meteorites consist of?
Student:
Mostly iron?
Professor:
Yeah… iron and some nickel, both of which are metals. And, if you're trying to find metal?
Student:
Oh! Metal detectors!
Professor:
Right, thank you. At least that's part of it. Stone meteorites, if they lie around exposed to the weather for a few years,
well, they're made of rock, so they end up looking almost indistinguishable from common terrestrial rocks--ones that
originated on earth. So it's hard to spot them by eye. But we can use metal detectors to help us find the others, and they're
easier to spot by eye. So most of the meteorites in collections, uh, in museums, they'll be...they're iron meteorites, or the
stony iron kind, even though they only make up about 5 percent of the meteorite material on the ground.

Conversation 1
Narrator:
Listen to a conversation between a student and the librarian employee.
Student:
Hi, I am looking for this book---the American judicial system. And I can’t seem to find it anywhere. I need to read a
chapter for my political science class.
Librarian:
Let me check in the computer. Um… doesn’t seem to be checked out and it’s not on reserve. You’ve checked the
shelves I assume.
Student:
Yeah, I even checked other shelves and tables next to where the book should be.
118Librarian:
Well, it’s still here in the library. So people must be using it. You know this seems to be a very popular book tonight.
We show six copies. None are checked out. And, yet you didn’t even find one copy on the shelves. Is it a big class?
Student:
Maybe about Seventy Five?
Librarian:
Well, you should ask your professor to put some of the copies on reserve. You know about the ‘Reserve system’, right?
Student:
I know that you have to read reserve books in the library and that you have time limits. But I didn’t know that I could
ask a professor to put a book on reserve. I mean I thought the professors make that kind of decisions at the beginning of the
semester.
Librarian:
Oh… they can put books on reserve at anytime during the semester.
Student:
You know reserving book seems a bit unfair. What if someone who is not in the class wants to use the book?
Librarian:
That’s why I said some copies.
Student:
Ah, well, I’ll certainly talk to my professor about it tomorrow. But what I am gonna do tonight?
Librarian:
I guess you could walk around the Poli-Sci (Political Science) section and look at the books waiting to be re-shelved.
Student:
There do seem to be more than normal.
Librarian:
We are a little short-staffed right now. Someone quit recently, so things aren’t getting re-shelved as quickly as usual. I
don’t think they’ve hired a replacement yet, so, yeah, the un-shelved books can get a bit out of hand.
Student:
This may sound a bit weird. But I’ve been thinking about getting a job. Um… I’ve never worked in a library before,
But…..
Librarian:
That’s not a requirement. The job might still be open. At the beginning of the semester we were swamped with
applications, but I guess everyone who wants a job has one by now.
Student:
What can you tell me about the job?
119Librarian:
Well, we work between six and ten hours a week, so it’s a reasonable amount. Usually we can pick the hours we want
to work. But since you’d be starting so late in the semester, I’m not sure how that would work for you. And… Oh… we get
paid the normal university rates for student employees.
Student:
So who do I talk to?
Librarian:
I guess you talk to Dr. Jenkins, the head librarian. She does the hiring.
TPO 14 Lecture 1 Psychology
Narrator:
Listen to part of a lecture in a psychology class
Professor:
We’ve said that the term “Cognition” refers to mental states like: knowing and believing, and to mental processes that
we use to arrive at those states. So for example, reasoning is a cognitive process, so is perception. We use information that
we perceive through our senses to help us make decisions, to arrive at beliefs and so on. And then there are memory and
imagination which relate to the knowledge of things that happen in the past or may happen in the future. So perceiving,
remembering, imagining are all internal mental processes that lead to knowing or believing.
Yet, each of these processes has limitations and can lead us to hold mistaken beliefs or make false predictions.
Take memory for example, maybe you have heard of studies in which people hear a list of related words. Um…, let`s
say a list of different kinds of fruit. After hearing this list, they are presented with several additional words. In this case,
we`ll say the additional words were “blanket” and “cherry”. Neither of these words was on the original list, and while
people will claim correctly that “blanket” was not on the original list, they’ll also claim incorrectly that the word “cherry”
was on the list. Most people are convinced they heard the word “cherry” on the original list. Why did they make such a
simple mistake? Well, we think because the words on the list were so closely related, the brain stored only the gist of what it
heard. For example, that all the items on the list were types of fruit. When we tap our memory, our brains often fill in details
and quite often these details are actually false.
We also see this “fill-in” phenomenon with perception. Perception is the faculty that allows us to process information
in the present as we take it in via our senses. Again, studies have shown that people will fill in information that they thought
they perceived even when they didn`t. For example, experiments have been done where a person hears a sentence, but it is
missing the word that logically completes it. They’ll claim to hear that word even though it was never said. So if I were to
say…er…the Sun rises in the…and then fail to complete the sentence, people will often claim to have heard the word
“east”.
In cognitive psychology, we have a phrase for this kind of inaccurate “filling in of details”--- it’s called: A Blind Spot.
The term originally refers to the place in our eyes where the optic nerve connects the back of the eye to the brain. There are
no photoreceptors in the area where the nerve connects to the eye. So that particular area of the eye is incapable of detecting
images. It produces “A Blind Spot” in our field of vision. We aren’t aware of it, because the brain fills in what it thinks
belongs in the image, so the picture always appears complete to us. But the term “blind spot” has also taken on a more
120general meaning--- it refers to people being unaware of a bias that may affect their judgment about a subject.
And the same “blind-spot phenomenon” that affects memory and perception also affects imagination. Imagination is a
faculty that some people use to anticipate future events in their lives. But the ease with which we imagine details can lead to
unrealistic expectations and can bias our decisions.
So…um…Peter, suppose I ask you to imagine a lunch salad, no problem, right? But I bet you imagine specific
ingredients. Did yours have tomatoes, Onion, Lettuce? mine did. Our brains fill in all sorts of details that might not be part
of other people’s image of a salad, which could lead to disappointment for us. If the next time we order a salad in a
restaurant, we have our imagined salad in mind, that’s not necessarily what we’ll get on our plate. The problem is not that
we imagine things, but that we assume what we’ve imagined is accurate. We should be aware that our imagination has this
built-in feature, the blind spot, which makes our predictions fall short of reality.
TPO 14 Lecture 2 Biology
Narrator:
Listen to part of a lecture in a biology class.
Professor:
Almost all animals have some way of regulating their body temperature; otherwise they wouldn’t survive extreme hot
or cold conditions---sweating, panting, swimming to cooler or warmer water; ducking into somewhere cool like a burrow or
a hole under a rock; these are just a few. And that spot is colder or warmer than the surrounding environment, because it’s a
microclimate.
A microclimate is a group of climate conditions that affect a localized area, weather features like temperature, wind,
moisture and so on. And when I say localized, I mean really localized, because microclimates can be, as the name suggests,
pretty small, even less than a square meter. And microclimates are affected by huge number of other variables. Obviously
weather conditions in the surrounding area are a factor. But other aspects of the location like, um… the elevation of the land,
the plant life nearby, and so on, have a substantial effect on microclimates. And of course the human development in the
area, um, a road will affect a nearby microclimate. It’s also interesting to note that microclimates that are near each other
can have very different conditions. In the forest for example, there can be a number of very different microclimates close to
each other, because of all the variables I just mentioned.
Student:
So how does a hole in the ground, a burrow, stay cool in a hot climate?
Professor:
Well, since cold air sinks, and these spots are shaded, they are usually much cooler than the surrounding area. And
these spots are so important because many animals rely on microclimates to regulate their body temperature. Um, for
instance, there is a species of squirrel, in the Western part of the United States that can get really hot when they are out
foraging for food. So they need a way to cool down. So what do they do? They go back to their own burrow. Once they get
there, their body temperatures decrease very, very quickly. The trip to the burrow prevents the squirrel from getting too hot.
121Student:
But squirrels are mammals, right? I thought mammals regulated their temperature
internally.
Professor:
Mammals do have the ability to regulate their body temperature, but not all can do it to the same degree, or even the
same way. Like when you walk outside on a hot day, you perspire, and your body cools itself down, a classic example of
how a mammal regulates its own body temperature. But one challenge that squirrels face, well many small mammals do, is
that because of their size, sweating would make them lose too much moisture. They dehydrate. But on the other hand, their
small size allows them to fit into very tiny spaces. So for small mammals, microclimates can make a big difference. They
rely on microclimates for survival.
Student:
So cold-blooded animals, like reptiles, they can’t control their own body temperature, so I can imagine the effect a
microclimate would have on them.
Professor:
Yes, many reptiles and insects rely on microclimates to control their body temperature. A lot of reptiles use burrows or
stay under rocks to cool down. Of course with reptiles, it’s a balancing act. Staying in the heat for too long can lead to
problems, but staying in the cold can do the same. So reptiles have to be really precise about where they spend their time,
even how they position their bodies. And when I say they’re precise, I mean it--- some snakes will search out a place under
rocks of a specific thickness, because too thin a rock doesn’t keep them cool enough, and too thick a rock will cause them to
get too cold. That level of precision is critical to the snake for maintaining its body temperature.
And even microscopic organisms rely on microclimates for survival. Think about this, decomposing leaves create heat
that warms the soil; the warm soil in turn affects the growth, the conditions of organisms there. And those organisms then
affect the rate of decomposition of the leaves. So a microclimate can be something so small and so easily disturbed that
even a tiny change can have a big impact. If someone on a hike knocks a couple of rocks over, they could be unwittingly
destroying a microclimate that an animal or organism relies on.
TPO 14 Conversation 2
Narrator:
Listen to a conversation between a student and his faculty adviser
Advisor:
Hi, Steve. I scheduled this appointment ‘cause it has been a while since we touched base.
Student:
I know I have been really busy--- a friend of mine works on the school paper. He asks me if I would like to try
reporting so I did and I really love it.
122Advisor:
Hey…that's sounds great!
Student:
Yeah… the first article I wrote, it was a profile of the chemistry professor---the one who was named Teacher of the
Year. My article ran on the front page. When I saw my name, I mean my byline in print, I was hooked. Now I know this is
what I want to do--- be a reporter.
Advisor:
Isn't it great to discover something that you really enjoy? And I read that the article too? It was very good.
Student:
To be honest, the article got lots of editing. In fact I barely recognized a couple of paragraphs. But the editor explained
why the changes were made. I learned a lot and my second article didn't need nearly as many changes.
Advisor:
Sounds like you’ve got a real knack for this.
Student:
Yeah… anyway, I am glad you scheduled this meeting ‘cause I want to change my major to journalism now.
Advisor:
Um... the university doesn't offer a major in journalism.
Student:
Oh no…
Advisor:
But….
Student:
I… I mean… should I transfer to another school, or major in English?
Advisor:
Well… wait a minute. Let me explain why the major isn’t offered. Editors at newspaper… editors… I mean when you
apply for a reporting job, editors look at two things--- they want to see clips, you know, some of your published articles,
they’ll also want you to try out, they’ll give you an assignment like… covering a press conference or some other event, then
see if you can craft a story about it, accurately, on deadline.
Student:
123So they don't even look at my major?
Advisor:
It is not that they don't look at it… it is… well, having a degree in something other than journalism should actually
work to your advantage.
Student:
How?
Advisor:
Most journalists specialize these days. They only write about science or business or technology for example. Is there a
type of reporting you think you may like to specialize in?
Student:
Well… I think it’d be really cool to cover the Supreme Court. I mean… their decisions
affect so many people.
Advisor:
That is really a goal worth striving for. So, why not continue major in political science? And as electives, you could
take some Pre-Law classes like Constitutional Law, and as for your work on the student newspaper, maybe they’d let you
cover some local court cases--- ones that students and professors here would want to read about.
Student:
Do you know of any？
Advisor:
I do. Actually, there is case involving this computer software program that one of our professors wrote. The district
court is deciding if the university is entitled to any of the professor’s profits?
Student:
Wow…. I will definitely follow up on that!
TPO 14 Lecture 3 Astronomy
Narrator:
Listen to part of a lecture in an astronomy class.
Professor:
OK, last time we talked about ancient agricultural civilizations that observed the stars and then used those observations
to keep track of the seasons. But today I want to talk about the importance of stars for early seafarers, about how the fixed
124patterns of stars were used as navigational aids.
OK, you’ve all heard about the Vikings and their impressive navigation skills, but the seafaring peoples of the Pacific
islands, the Polynesians and the Micronesians, were quite possibly the world’s greatest navigators. Long before the
development of, uh, advanced navigational tools in Europe, Pacific islanders were travelling from New Zealand to Hawaii
and back again, using nothing but the stars as their navigational instruments.
Um, the key to the Pacific islanders’ success was probably their location near the equator. What that meant was that the
sky could be partitioned, divided up, much more symmetrically than it could farther away from the equator. Unlike the
Vikings, early observers of the stars in Polynesia or really anywhere along the equator would feel that they were at the very
center of things, with the skies to the north and the skies to the south behaving identically, they could see stars going straight
up in the east and straight down in the west. So it was easier to discern the order in the sky than farther north or farther
south, where everything would seem more chaotic.
Take the case of the Gilbert Islands, they are part of Polynesia, and lie very close to the equator. And the people there
were able to divide the sky into symmetrical boxes, according to the main directions, north, east, south and west. And they
could precisely describe the location of a star by indicating its position in one of those imaginary boxes. And they realized
that you had to know the stars in order to navigate. In fact there was only one word for both in the Gilbert Islands, when you
wanted the star expert, you ask for a navigator.
Um, islanders from all over the Pacific learned to use the stars for navigation, and they passed this knowledge down
from generation to generation. Some of them utilized stone structures called stone canoes, uh, and these canoes were on
land, of course, and you can still see them on some islands today. They were positioned as if they were heading in the
direction of the points on the sea horizon where certain stars would appear and disappear during the night, and, um, young,
would-be navigators sat by the stones at night and turned in different directions to memorize the constellations they saw, so
they could recognize them and navigate… by them later on when they went out to sea.
One important way the Polynesians had for orienting themselves was by using zenith stars. A zenith star was a really
bright star that would pass directly overhead at a particular latitude…at a particular distance from the equator, often at a
latitude associated with some particular Pacific island. So the Polynesians could estimate their latitude just by looking
straight up, by observing whether a certain zenith star passed directly overhead at night, they’d know if they have reached
the same latitude as a particular island they were trying to get to.
Um, another technique used by the Polynesians was to look for a star pair, that’s two stars that rise at the same time, or
set at the same time, and navigators could use these pairs of stars as reference points, because they rise or set together only
at specific latitudes. So navigators might see one star pair setting together. And, uh…would know how far north or south of
the equator they were. And if they kept on going, and the next night they saw the pair of stars setting separately, then they
would know that they were at a different degree of latitude. So looking at rising and setting star pairs is a good technique.
Um… actually it makes more sense with setting stars; they can be watched instead of trying to guess when they’ll rise.
Uh, OK, I think all this shows that navigating doesn’t really require fancy navigational instruments; the peoples of
Pacific islands had such expert knowledge of astronomy as well as navigation that they were able to navigate over vast
stretches of open ocean. Uh, it's even possible that Polynesian navigators had already sailed to the Americas, centuries
before Columbus.
125TPO 14 Lecture 4 Archeology
Narrator:
Listen to part of a lecture in an archaeology class
Professor:
When we think of large monumental structures built by early societies, an Egyptian pyramid probably comes to mind.
But there are some even earlier structures in the British Isles also worth discussing, and besides the well-known circle of
massive stones of Stonehenge, which don’t get me wrong is remarkable enough, well, other impressive Neolithic structures
are found there too. Oh, yes, we are talking about the Neolithic period here, also called new Stone Age, which was the time
before stone tools began to be replaced by tools made of bronze and other metals. It was about 5000 years ago, even before
the first Egyptian pyramid that some amazing Neolithic monuments---tombs, were erected at various sites around Ireland,
Great Britain and coastal islands nearby.
I am referring particular to structures that in some cases, look like ordinary natural hills but were definitely built by
humans, well-organized communities of humans to enclose a chamber or room within stone walls and sometimes with a
high, cleverly designed ceiling of overlapping stones. These structures are called Passage Graves, because the inner
chamber, sometimes several chambers in fact, could only be entered from the outside through a narrow passageway.
Michael:
Excuse me, professor, but you said Passage Graves. Were these just monuments to honor the dead buried there or were
they designed to be used somehow by the living?
Professor:
Ah, yes! Good question, Michael. Besides being built as tombs, some of these Passage Graves were definitely what we
might call Astronomical Calendars, with chambers that were flooded with sunlight on certain special days of the year, which
must’ve have seemed miraculous and inspired a good deal of religious wonder. But research indicates that not just light but
also the physics of sound helped enhance
this religious experiences.
Michael:
How so?
Professor:
Well, first the echoes. When a religious leader started chanting with echoes bouncing off the stonewalls over and over
again, it must’ve seemed like a whole chorus of other voices, spirits of Gods maybe, joining in.
But even more intriguing is what physicists called
Standing Waves. Basically, the phenomenon of Standing Waves occurs when sound waves of the same frequency
reflect off the walls and meet from opposite directions. So, the volume seems to alternate between very loud and very soft.
You can stand quite near a man singing in loud voice and hardly hear him. Yet step a little further away and his voice is
almost deafening. As you move around the chamber, the volume of the sound goes way up and way down, depending on
where you are in these standing waves. And often the acoustics make it hard to identify where sounds are coming from. It’s
as if powerful voices are speaking to you or chanting from inside your own head. This had to engender a powerful sense of
awe in Neolithic worshipers.
And another bit of physics at play here is something called Resonance. I am no physicist, but well I imagine you have
126all blown air over the top of an empty bottle and heard the sound it makes. And you’ve probably noticed that depending on
its size--- each empty bottle plays one particular musical note. Or as a physicist might put it, each bottle resonates at a
particular frequency. Well, that’s true of these chambers too. If you make a constant noise inside the chamber, maybe by
steadily beating drum at a certain rate, a particular frequency of sound will resonate, will ring out intensely, depending on
the size of the chamber. In some of the larger chambers though, these intensified sound may be too deep for us to hear, we
can feel it. We are mysteriously agitated by it….but it is not a sound our ears can hear.
The psychological effects of all these extraordinary sounds can be profound, especially when they seem so
disconnected from the human doing the drumming or chanting. And there can be observable physical effects on people too.
In fact, the sounds can cause headaches, feelings of dizziness, increased heart rate, that sort of thing, you see. Anyway, what
was experienced inside one of these Passage Graves clearly could be far more intense than the everyday reality outside,
which made them very special places.
But back to your question, Michael, as to whether these Graves were designed to be used by the living. Well, certainly,
with regard to astronomical or calendar function. That seems pretty obvious, and I wanna go into more detail on that now.

Oh, great! I'm Peter Murphy. You probably don't remember me, but …
Advisor
No! No! I remember you . You were interested in working for the paper.
Student
Yeah, as a reporter .
Advisor
That's right. You're taking a journalism class and you’ve done some reporting before in high school, right?
Student
Wow, you have a good memory.
Advisor
Well we haven ’ t had many students applying lately so … so anyway, you still want to do some reporting for us?
Student
Yeah, if you have room for me on the staff .
Advisor
Well we always need more reporters, but you know, we don't pay anything, right?
Student
127Yeah, I know, but I ...uh.. . I'd like the experience. It would look good on my resume .
Advisor
Absolutely! Let's see . I think I told you that we ask prospective reporters to turn in some outlines for possible articles .
Student
Yeah, I sent them in about a week ago, but I haven't heard anything back yet, so, so I thought I'd stop by and see, but I
guess you haven't looked at them yet .

WeII, you turned in an outline on something to do with the physics department?
Student
Yeah, they're trying to come up with ways to get more students to take their introductory courses.
Advisor
Right, well , apparently, nobody else is covering that story , so he wants you to follow up on it.
Student
OK. Uh … what about the other outline I sent in, about the proposed increase in tuition fees?
Advisor
Oh, it looks like we've got that covered

128TPO 15 Lecture 1 Psychology
Narrator:
Listen to part of a lecture in a psychology class
Professor
For decades, psychologists have been looking at our ability to perform tasks while other things are going on, how we
are able to keep from being distracted and what the conditions for good concentration are.
As long ago as 1982, researchers came up with something called the CFQ - the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire. This
questionnaire asks people to rate themselves according to how often they get distracted in different situations, like um … ..
forgetting to save a computer file because they had something else on their mind or missing a speed limit sign on the road.
John?
John
I've lost my share of computer files, but not because I’m easily distracted. I just forget to save them.
Professor
And that's part of the problem with th e CFQ. It doesn ’ t take other factors into account enough, like forgetfulness.
Plus you really can ’ t say you are getting objective scientific results from a subjective questionnaire where people report on
themselves.
So it ’ s no surprise that someone attempted to design an objective way to measure distraction. I t ’ s a simple computer
game designed by a psychologist named, Nilli Lavie. In Lavie ’ s game, people watch as the letters N and X appear and
disappear in a certain area on the computer screen. Every time they see an N, they press one key, and every time they see an
X they press another, except other letters also start appearing in the surrounding area of the screen with increasing frequency
which creates a distraction and makes the task more difficult. Lavie observed that people ’ s reaction time slowed as these
distractions increased.
Student 2
Well that’s not too surprising, is it?
Professor
No, it's not. It's the next part of the experiment that was surprising. When the difficulty really increased, when the
screen filled up with letters, people got better at spotting the Xs and Ns . Why do you think that happened?
John
Well, maybe when we are really concentrating, we just don't perceive irrelevant information . Maybe we just don't take
it in, you know?
Professor
Yes, and that's one of the hypotheses that was proposed, that the brain simply doesn't admit the unimportant
information. The second hypothesis is that, yes, we do perceive everything, but the brain categorizes the information, and
whatever is not relevant to what we are concentrating on gets treated as low priority.
So Lavie did another experiment, designed to look at this ability to concentrate better in the face of increased difficulty.
This time she used brain scanning equipment to monitor activity in a certain part of the brain, the area called V5, which is
part of the visual cortex, the part of our brains that processes visual stimuli. V5 is the area of the visual cortex that's
responsible for the sensation of movement. Once again, Lavie gave people a computer-based task to do.
They have to distinguish between words in upper and lower-case letters or even harder, they had to count the number
129of syllables in different words. This time the distraction was a moving star field in the background, you know, where it looks
like you are moving through space, passing stars. Normally area of V5 would be stimulated as those moving stars are
perceived and sure enough, Lavie found that during the task area of V5 was active, so people were aware of the moving star
field. That means people were not blocking out the distraction.
Student
So doesn't that mean that the first hypothesis you mentioned was wrong, the one that says we don't even perceive
irrelevant information when we are concentrating?
Professor
Yes that's right, up to a point, but that’s not all. Lavie also discovered that as she made the task more difficult , V5
became less active, so that means that now people weren ’ t really noticing the star field at all. That was quite a surprise and
it proved that the second hypothesis – that we do perceive everything all the time but the brain categorizes distractions
differently, well, that wasn't true either.
Lavie thinks the solution lies in the brai ’s ability to accept or ignore visual information. She thinks its capacity is
limited. It’s like a highway. When there are too many cars, traffic is stopped. No one can get on. So when the brain is loaded
to capacity, no new distractions can be perceived .
Now that may be the correct conclusion for visual distractions, but more research is needed to tell us how the brain
deals with, say, the distractions of solving a math problem when we are hungry or when someone is singing in the next
room.
TPO 15 Lecture 2 Geology
Narrator:
Listen to part of a lecture in a geology class .
Professor
As geologists, we examine layers of sediment on the Earth' s surface to approximate the dates of past geologic time
periods. Uh... sediment as you know, is material like sand , gravel, fossil fragments that is transported by natural processes
like wind , water flow or the movement of glaciers. So sediment is transported and then deposited and it forms layers on the
Earth’s surface over time. We examine these layers to learn about different geologic time periods including when they began
and ended.
For example, from about 1.8 million years ago to around 11 thousand years ago was the Pleistocene Epoch. The
Pleistocene Epoch was an ice age. During this Epoch, sediment was made by the kind of erosion and weathering that
happens when the climate is colder, and part of those sediments are fossils of plants and animals that lived at that time.
The Holocene Epoch followed the Pleistocene Epoch when the Earth ’ s climate warmed up around 11 thousand years
ago. The Holocene Epoch is characterized by different sediments, ones that form when the climate is warmer. Because the
climate changed, the types of plants and animals changed also. Holocene sediments contain remnants of more recent plants
and animals, so it's pretty easy to differentiate geologically between these two Epochs.
Now there is growing evidence that the presence of humans has altered the Earth so much that a new Epochc of
geologic history has begun – the Anthropocene Epoch, a new human-influenced Epoch. This idea that we’ve entered a new
Anthropocene Epoch was first proposed in 2002. The idea is that around the year 1800 CE the human population became
130large enough, around a billion people, that its activities started altering the environment.
This was also the time of the industrial revolution, which brought a tremendous increase in the use of fossil fuels such
as coal. The exploitation of fossil fuels has brought planetwide developments: industrialization, construction, uh, mass
transport. And these developments have caused major changes like additional erosion of the Earth’s surface and
deforestation. Also, things like the damming of rivers , has caused increased sediment production, not to mention the
addition of more carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere. Naturally all these changes show up in recent sediments.
And these sediments are quite different from pre year 1800 sediment layers.
Interestingly there's some speculation that humans started having a major impact on Earth much earlier, about 8000
years ago. That's when agriculture was becoming widespread. Early farmers started clearing forests and livestock produced
a lot of extra methane. But I want to stress this is just a hypothesis. The idea that early humans could have had such a major
effect, well I'm just not sure we can compare it with the industrial age.
Geologists in the far future will be able to examine the sediment being laid down today, whereas right now we can say
that yes, human impact on the Earth is clear: It'll be future researchers who have a better perspective and will be able to
really draw a line between the Holocene and the Anthropocene Epochs

Listen to part of a conversation between a student and her biology professor .
Professor
Hi Samantha, how did your track meet go?
Samantha
Great! I placed first in one race and third in another.
Professor
Congratulations ! You must practice a lot.
Samantha
Three times a week pre-season, but now that we’re competing every weekend, we practice 6 days a week from 3:30 till
5:00.
Professor
Athletics place a heavy demand on your time, don ’ t they?
Samantha
Yeah, but I really love competing, so …
Professor
You know I played soccer in college and my biggest challenge, and I didn ’ t always succeed, was getting my studying
in during soccer season. Are you having a similar …
Samantha
No, I … I really do make time to study. And I actually study more for this class than I do for all my other classes. But I
didn ’ t see the grade I expected on my mid-term exam, which is why I came by.
Professor
Well, you didn't do badly on the exam, but I agree it did not reflect your potential. I say this because your work on the
lab project was exemplary. I was so impressed with the way you handle the microscope and the samples of onion cells, and
with how carefully you observed and diagramed and interpreted each stage of cell division. And I don't think you could
131have done that if you hadn't read and understood the chapter. I mean it seemed like you really had a good understanding of
it.
Samantha
I thought so too, but I missed some questions about cell division on the
exam.
Professor
So what happened?
Samantha
I just sort of blanked out, I guess. I had a hard time remembering details.
It was so frustrating.
Professor
Alright, let's back up. You say you studied, where, at home?
Samantha
At my kitchen table actually.
Professor
And that's supposed to be a quiet environment?
Samantha
Not exactly. My brother and parents try to keep it down when I am studying, but the phone pretty much rings off the
hook, so …
Professor
So you might try a place with fewer distractions, like the library …
Samantha
But the library closes at mid-night, and I like to study all night before a test, you know, so everything is fresh in my
mind. I studied six straight hours the night before the mid-term exam . That ’ s why I expected to do so much better.
Professor
Oh ok. You know that studying six consecutive hours is not equivalent to studying one hour a day for six days.
Samantha
It isn’t?
Professor
No. There is research that shows that after about an hour of intense focus, your brain needs a break. It needs to, you
know, shift gears a little. Your brain's ability to absorb information starts to decline after about the first hour. So if you are
dealing with a lot of new concepts and vocabulary, anyway, if you just review your notes, even 20 minutes a day, it'd be
much better than waiting until the night before an exam to try and absorb all those details.
Samantha
Oh, I didn't realize.
Professor
Think of your brain as a muscle. If you didn't practice regularly with your track team, and then tried to squeeze in three
weeks worth of running practice the day before a track meet, how well do you think you'd perform in your races?
TPO 15 Lecture 3 Art History
Narrator:
Listen to part of a lecture in an art history class.
Professor:
Now in Europe in the Middle Ages before the invention of printing and the printing press, all books, all manuscripts
were hand-made. And the material typically used for the pages was parchment, which is animal skin that’s stretched and
132dried under tension, so it become s really flat and can be written on . During the 1400s, when printing was being developed,
paper became the predominant material for books in Europe, but prior to that, it was parchment. Parchment is durable, much
more so than paper, and it could be reused which came in handy since it was a costly material and in short supply, so it
wasn ’ t uncommon for the scribes or monks who produced the manuscripts .
Ah, remember before printing books were made mainly in monasteries . Well, the scribes often recycled the parchment
that’d been used for earlier manuscripts. They simply
erased the ink off the parchment and wrote something new in its place
A manuscript page that was written on, erased and then used again is
called a palimpsest.
Palimpsests were created, well, we know about two methods that were used for removing ink from parchment. In the
late Middle Ages, it was customary to scrape away the surface of the parchment with an abrasive, which completely wiped
out any writing that was there. But earlier in the Middle Ages, the original ink was usually removed by washing the used
parchment with milk. That removed the ink. But with the passing of time, the original writing might reappear. In fact , it
might reappear to the extent that scholars could make out and even decipher the original text.
Perhaps, the most famous example is the Archimedes' palimpsest.
Archimedes lived in Greece around 200 BCE, and as you probably know, he's considered one of the greatest
Mathematicians who ever lived, even though many of his writings had been lost , including what many now think to be his
most important work called The Method .
But in 1998, a book of prayers from the Middle Ages sold in an art auction for a lot of money, more money than
anyone would pay for a damaged book from the 12th century. Beautiful or not, why? It had been discovered that the book
was a palimpsest, and beneath the surface writing of the manuscript laid, guess what? Mathematical theorems and diagrams
from Archimedes.
Archimedes' writings were originally done on papyrus scrolls. Then in the 10 th century, a scribe made a copy on
parchment of some of his texts and diagrams including, as it turns out, The Method . This was extremely fortunate, since
later on, the original papyrus scrolls disappeared. About 200 years later in the 12 th century, this parchment manuscript
became a palimpsest when a scribe used the parchment to make a prayer book. So the pages, the pieces of parchment
themselves, had been preserved. But the Archimedes' text was erased and written over, and no one knew it existed.
It wasn't until 1906 that a scholar came across the prayer book in a library and realized it was a palimpsest, and that the
underlying layer of texts could only have come from Archimedes. That was when his work The Method was discovered for
the first time.
Um... the palimpsest then went through some more tough times, but eventually it ended up in an art auction where was
bought and then donated to an art museum in Baltimore, for conservation and study. To avoid further damage to the
manuscript, the research team at the art museum has had to be extremely selective in the techniques they used to see the
original writing. They've used ultraviolet light and some other techniques, and if you're interested in that sort of thing, you
can learn more about it in an art conservation class.
But actually, it was a physicist who came up with a method that was a breakthrough. He realized that the iron in the
ancient ink would display if exposed to a certain X-ray imaging method, and except for small portions of the text that
couldn't be deciphered, this technique's been very helpful in seeing Archimedes' texts and drawings through the medieval
overwriting.
133TPO 15 Lecture 4 Biology
Narrator:
Listen to part of a lecture in a biology class.
Professor:
OK. We've been talking till now about the two basic needs of a biological
community – an energy source to produce organic materials, you know
uh, food for the organisms, and the waste recycling or breakdown of
materials back into inorganic molecules, and about how all this requires
photosynthesis when green plants or microbes convert sunlight into
energy, and also requires microorganisms, bacteria, to secrete chemicals
that break down or recycle the organic material to complete the cycle.
So, now we are done with this chapter of the textbook, we can just
review for the weekly quiz and move on to the next chapter, right? Well,
not so fast. First, I ‘d like to talk about some discoveries that have
challenged one of these fundamental assumptions about what you need
in order to have a biological community.
And, well, there actually were quite a few surprises. It all began in 1977 with the exploration of hydrothermal vents on
the ocean floor. Hydrothermal vents are cracks in the Earth’s surface that occur, well, the ones we are taiking about here are
found deep at the bottom of the ocean. And these vents on the ocean floor, they release this incredibly hot water, 3 to 4 times
the temperature that you boil water at, because this water has been heated deep within the Earth.
Well about 30 years ago, researchers sent a deep-sea vessel to explore the ocean’s depth, about 3 kilometers down, way
deep to the ocean floor, No one had ever explored that far down before. Nobody expected there to be any life down there
because of the conditions.
First of all, sunlight doesn't reach that far down so it ’ s totally dark. There couldn’t be any plant or animal life since
there's no sunlight, no source of energy to make food. If there was any life at all, it’d just be some bacteria breaking down
any dead materials that might have fallen to the bottom of the ocean . And?
Student 1
And what about the water pressure? Didn ’ t we talk before about how the deeper down into the ocean you go, the
greater the pressure?
Professor
Excellent point! And not only the extreme pressure, but also the extreme temperature of the water around these vents.
If the lack of sunlight didn't rule out the existence of a biological community down there then these factors certainly would,
or so they thought.
Student 2
So you are telling us they did find organisms that could live under those conditions?
134Professor:
They did indeed, something like 300 different species.
Student 1
But... but how could that be? I mean without sunlight, no energy, no no …
Protessor:
What they discovered was that microorganisms, bacteria, had taken over both functions of the biological community -
the recycling of waste materials and the production of energy. They were the energy source. You see, it turns out that certain
microorganisms are chemosynthetic - they don't need sunlight because they take their energy from chemical reactions.
So, as I said, unlike green plants which are photosynthetic and get their energy from sunlight, these bacteria that they
found at the ocean floor, these are chemosynthetic, which means that they get their energy from chemical reactions. How
does this work?
As we said, these hydrothermal vents are releasing into the ocean depth this intensely hot water and here is the thing,
this hot water contains a chemical called hydrogen sulfide, and also a gas , carbon dioxide. Now these bacteria actually
combine the hydrogen sulfide with the carbon dioxide and this chemical reaction is what produces organic material which is
the food for larger organisms. The researchers had never seen anything like it before.
Student 2 :
Wow! So just add a chemical to a gas, and bingo, you ’ ve got a food supply?
Professor
Not just that! W hat was even more surprising were all the large organisms that lived down there. The most distinctive
of these was something called the tube worm. Here, let me show you a picture . The tube of the tube worm is really, really
long. They can be up to one and a half meters long , and these tubes are attached to the ocean floor, pretty weird looking,
huh?
And another thing, the tube worm has no mouth or digestive organs. So you are asking how does it eat? Well, they
have these special organs that collect the hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide and then transfer it to
another organ, where billions of bacteria live. These bacteria that live
inside the tube worms, the tube worms provide them with hydrogen
sulfide and carbon dioxide. And the bacteria, well the bacteria kind of
feed the tube worms through chemosynthesis, remember, that chemical
reaction I described earlier.

Conversation1
Narrator:
Listen to a conversation between a Student and a facilities Manager at the university.
Student:
Hi. I’m Melanie, the one who’s been calling.
135Manager:
From the singing group, right?
Student:
From the choir.
Manager:
Right, the choir. It’s nice to finally meet you in person. So, you are having problems with...
Student:
Noise. Like I explained on the phone we’ve always had our rehearsals in the Lincoln Auditorium every day at 3
o’clock and it’s always worked just great. But the past few weeks with the noise, it’s been a total nightmare since
construction started next door on the science hall.
Manager:
Oh, that’s right. They’re building that addition for new laboratories.
Student:
Exactly. Anyway, ever since they started working on it, it’s been so noisy we can barely hear ourselves think.
Manager:
Let alone sing.
Student:
Forget about singing. I mean, we keep the windows down and everything, but once those bulldozers get going, I mean
those machines are loud. We’ve already had to cut short two rehearsals and we’ve got a concert in 6 weeks.
Manager:
Well, that’s not good. I’m assuming you’ve tried to reschedule your rehearsals. They don’t do construction work at
night.
Student:
I ran that by the group, but there were just too many... I mean evenings are really hard. It seems like everyone in the
choir already has plans and some even have classes at night.
Manager:
And what about the music building?
Student:
You know, originally we were booked in one of the rehearsal rooms in the music building, but then we switched with
the jazz ensemble. They’re a much smaller group and they said the acoustics, the sound in that room, was better for them.
So having us move to a bigger space like the Lincoln Auditorium seemed like a reasonable idea.
Manager:
But now...
Student:
All that noise. I don’t know. I just wonder if the jazz ensemble knew what was going to happen.
136Manager:
Well, that wouldn’t be very nice.
Student:
No. But it really was quite a coincidence. Anyway, now the music building’s fully booked, mornings, afternoons,
everything, we just need a quiet space. And it has to have a piano.
Manager:
A piano. Of course some of the other auditoriums have pianos, but that’s not going to be
easy.
Student:
You think they’re pretty booked up?
Manager:
Probably. But it can’t hurt to check. What about Bradford Hall? I remember a piano in
the old Student center there.
Student:
At this point, we’d be grateful for any quiet place.
Manager:
Can you... How flexible can you be on times? You said no evenings, but what if can’t find something open at 3 o’clock?
Can you move earlier or later?
Student:
I wish I could say another time would be okay, but you know how it is, everybody’s already got commitments for the
whole semester. 2:30 or 3:30 would probably be okay, but I don’t think we could go much outside that
Manager:
Well, check with me tomorrow morning. I should’ve found something by then. It might
not be ideal...
Student:
As long as it’s got a piano and nobody’s putting up a building next door, we’ll be happy.
TPO 16 Lecture 1 geology
Narrator:
Listen to a part of lecture in a geology class.
Professor:
Now there are some pretty interesting caves in parts of the western United States, especially in national parks. There is
one part that has over a hundred caves, including some of the largest ones in the world. One of the more interesting ones is
137called Lechuguilla Cave. Lechuguilla has been explored a lot in recent decades. It’s a pretty exciting place I think. It was
mentioned only briefly in your books. So can anyone remember what it said? Ellen?
Male Student:
It’s the deepest limestone cave in the U.S.?
Professor:
That’s right. It’s one of the longest and deepest limestone caves not just in the country but in the world. Now, what
else?
Male Student:
Well, it was formed because of sulfuric acid, right?
Professor:
That’s it. Yeah, what happens is you have deep underground oil deposits and there are
bacteria. Here let me draw a diagram.
Part of the limestone rock layer is permeated by water from below. Those curly lines are supposed to be cracks in the
rock. Below the water table and rock is oil. Bacteria feed on this oil and release hydrogen sulfide gas. This gas is hydrogen
sulfide, rises up and mixes with oxygen in the underground water that sits in the cracks and fissures in the limestone. And
when hydrogen sulfide reacts with the oxygen in the water, the result of that is sulfuric acid, Ok? Sulfuric acid eats away at
limestone very aggressively. So you get bigger cracks and then passageways being formed along the openings in the rock
and it’s all underground. Ah yes, Paul?
Male Student:
So that water... It’s not flowing, right? It’s still?
Professor:
Yes, so there’s two kinds of limestone caves. In about 90 percent of them, you have water from the surface, streams,
waterfall or whatever - moving water that flows through cracks found in the limestone. It’s the moving water itself that
wears away at the rock and makes passageways.
Also, in surface water, there is a weak acid, carbonic acid, not sulfuric acid, but carbonic acid that helps dissolve the
rock. With a little help from this carbonic acid, moving water forms most of the world’s limestone caves. When I was
researching this for a study a few years ago, I visited a couple of these typical limestone caves, and they were all very wet,
you know, from streams and rivers. This flowing water
carved out the caves and the structures inside them.
Male Student:
But not Lechuguilla?
Professor:
Dry as a bone. Well, that might be a bit of an exaggeration. But it’s safe to say that it’s sulfuric acid and not moving
water that formed Lechuguilla cave and those few other ones like it. In fact, there is no evidence that flowing water has even
gone in or out of the cave. So, it’s like a maze. You have passageways all around. There are wide passages, narrow ones at
all different depths, like underground tunnels in the limestone. And, since they were created underground and not fromflowing surface water, not all these passageways have an opening to the outside world.
And.. .and there is other evidence that
flowing water wasn’t involved in Lechuguilla. We’ve said that sulfuric acid dissolves limestone, right, and forms the
138passageways? What else does sulfuric acid do? Paul?
Male Student:
Ah, leaves a chemical residue ... um...
FeMale Student:
Gypsum, right?
Professor:
Yep, you’ll find lots of gypsum deposited at Lechuguilla. And, as we know, gypsum is soluble in water. So if there
were flowing water in the cave, it would dissolve the gypsum. This is part of what led us to the realization that Lechuguilla
is in that small group of waterless caves.
And Lechuguilla is pretty much dormant now. It’s not really forming any more. But, there is other ones like it, for
example, in Mexico, that are forming. And when cave researchers go to explore them, they see and smell, the sulfuric acid
and gases of...er...phew...now, something else, think of rotten eggs. And, it’s not just the smell. Explorers even need to wear
special masks to protect themselves from the gases in these caves. OK? Paul.
Male Student:
Yeah, how about what these caves look like on the inside?
Professor:
Well, the formations.. .there is really something. There’s such variety there, like nothing anywhere else in the world,
some of them are elaborate looking, like decorations. And a lot of them are made of gypsum and could be up to 20 feet long.
It’s pretty impressive.
TPO 16 Lecture 2 music history
Narrator:
Listen to part of a lecture in a music history class.
Professor:
Up until now in our discussions and readings about the Baroque and early classical periods,
we’ve been talking about the development of musical styles and genres within the
relatively narrow social context of its patronage by the upper classes. Composers, after all, had to earn a living and
those who were employed in the services of a specific patron, well, I don’t have to spell it out for you, the likes and dislikes
of that patron, this would’ve had an effect on what was being composed and performed. Now, of course, there were many
other influences on composers, um, such as the technical advances we’ve seen and the development of some of the
instruments, uh, you remember the transverse flute, the clarinet and so on.
But I think if I were asked to identify a single crucial development in European music of this time, it would be the
invention of the piano, which, interestingly enough also had a significant effect on European society of that time. And I’ll
get to that in a minute.
139Now, as we know, keyboard instruments existed long before the piano - the organ, which dates back to the Middle
Ages, as do other keyboard instruments, such as the harpsichord which is still popular today with some musicians. But none
of these has had as profound an impact as the piano.
Uh, the piano was invented in Italy in 1709. The word piano is short for pianoforte, a combination of the Italian words
for soft and loud. Now, unlike the harpsichord which came before it, the piano is a percussion instrument. You see, the
harpsichord is actually classified as a string instrument, since pressing a key of a harpsichord causes a tiny quill that’s
connected to the key to pluck the strings that are inside the instrument, much the same as a guitar pick plucks the strings of
a guitar But pressing the keys of a piano causes tiny felt-covered hammers to strike the strings inside the instrument, like
drumsticks striking the head of a drum. This striking action is why the piano is a percussion instrument instead of a string
instrument.
Okay, so why is this so important? Well, the percussive effect of those little hammers means that the pianist, unlike the
harpsichordist, can control the dynamics of the sound - how softly or loudly each note is struck, hence the name, pianoforte,
soft and loud.
Now, artistically for both composers and performers this was a major turning point. This brand new instrument,
capable of producing loud and soft tones, greatly expanded the possibilities for conveying emotion. This capacity for
increased expressiveness, in fact, was essential to the Romantic style that dominated 19th century music. But I’m getting
ahead of myself.
Um, before we get back to the musical impact of this development, I wanna take a look at the social impact that I
mentioned earlier.
Now, in the late 1700s and the earlier 1 800s, the development of the piano coincided with the growth of the middle
class in Western Europe. Of course folk music, traditional songs and dances had always been part of everyday life. But as
mass production techniques were refined in the 19th century, the price of pianos dropped to the point that a larger proportion
of the population could afford to own them. As pianos became more available, they brought classical music, the music
which previously had been composed only for the upper classes, into the lives of the middle class people as well.
One way in particular that we can see the social impact of this instrument is its role in the lives of women of the time.
Previously, it was quite rare for a woman to perform on anything, but maybe a harp or maybe she sang. But suddenly in the
19th century it became quite acceptable, even, to some extent, almost expected for a middle-class European woman to be
able to play the piano, partly because among upper-middle class women it was a sign of refinement. But it was also an
excellent way for some women to earn money by giving piano lessons.
And some women, those few who had exceptional talent and the opportunity to develop it, their lives were
dramatically affected. Later we’ll be listening to works by a composer named Robert Schumann. But let’s now talk about
his wife Clara Schumann. Clara Schumann was born in Germany in 1819. She grew up surrounded by pianos. Her father
sold pianos and both her parents were respected piano teachers. She learned to play the instrument when she was a small
child and gave her first public recital at age 9. Clara grew up to become a well-known and respected piano virtuoso, a
performer of extraordinary skill who not only gave concerts across Europe, but also was one of the first important female
composers for the instrument.

Listen to a conversation between a Professor and a Student .
Professor
Jeff, I’m glad you drop by. I’ve been meaning to congratulate you on the class leadership
award.
Student
Thanks Professor Brownson, I was really happy to get it and a little surprised. I mean, there were so many other people
nominated.
Professor
Well, I know the award was well deserved. Now, what can I do for you today?
Student
I needed to talk to you about the medieval history test you know, the one scheduled for
Friday afternoon.
Professor
Yes?
Student
Well, there is this trip that my French class is taking. We are going to Montreal for the weekend.
Professor
Montreal? That’s my favorite city. What’ll you be seeing there?
Student
I’m not sure yet. Well, the reason, the main reason I wanted to go is that we’ll be rooming with French speaking
Students there, you know, so we can get a chance to use our French, to actually talk with real French speakers.
Professor
It sounds like a good opportunity. But then, there is that test...
Student
Yeah... but.. well, the thing is the bus leaves right in the middle of when our history class meets this Friday. So, well, I
was thinking maybe I could take the test on a different day like Monday morning during your office hours?
Professor
Eh...Monday morning...um...that would not be...oh wait, let me just see one thing. Aha, okay. That’s what I thought. So,
for your class, I was planning a take-home exam so you could just take the test along with you. Let’s see, I guess you could
come to class Friday just to pick up the test. That way you’d still make your bus, and then find some quiet time during your
trip to complete it and you can bring it to class Wednesday when I’ll be collecting everyone else’s.
Student
141Hmm.. . um...during the trip, well, I guess I could. So I should plan to take my books and
stuff with me.
Professor
You’ll definitely need your class notes. I’m giving you several short essay questions to make you think critically about
the points we’ve discussed in class, to state.. .uh state and defend your opinion, analyze the issues, speculate about how
things might have turned out differently. So, you see, I don’t care if you look updates and that kind of thing. What I want is
for you to synthesize information to reflect back on what we’ve read and discussed and to form your own ideas, not just
repeat points from the textbook. Does that make sense?
Student
Yeah, I think so. You are looking for my point of view.
Professor
That’s right. The mid-term exam showed me that you know all the details of who, where and when. For this test, I want
to see how you can put it all together to show some original thinking.
Student
That’s sounds pretty challenging, especially trying to work it into this trip. But, yeah, I think I can do it.
Professor
I’m sure you can.
Student
Thank you, Professor Brownson.
Professor
Have a great time in Montreal.
TPO 16 Lecture 3 biology
Narrator:
Listen to a part of a lecture in a biology class.
Professor
OK. Let’s continue our discussion about animal behavior by talking about decisions that animals face, complex ones.
Animals, even insects, carry out what look like very complex decision making processes.
The question is how. I mean no one really thinks that, say a bee goes through weighing the pros and cons of pollinating
this flower or that flower. But then how do animals solve complex questions, questions that seem to require decision making.
The answer we’ll propose of course is that their behavior is largely a matter of natural selection. As an example, let’s look at
foraging behavior among beavers.
Beavers eat plants, mostly trees. And they also use trees and tree branches to construct their homes in streams and lakes.
142So when they do forage for food and for shelter materials, they have to leave their homes and go up on land where their
main predators are. So there are a number of choices that have to be made about foraging.
So for example, um... they need to decide what kind of tree they should cut down. Some trees have higher nutritional
value than others, and some are better for building material, and some are good for both... um...aspen trees. Beavers peel off
the bark to eat and they also use the branches for building their shelters. So aspens do double duty. But ash trees, beavers
use ash trees only for construction.
Another decision is when to forage for food. Should they go out during the daytime when it’s hotter outside and they
have to expend more energy, or at night when the weather is cooler but predators are more active? Ok, but there are two
more important issues, really the most central, the most important, OK?
First, let’s say a beaver could get the same amount of wood from a single large tree, one that has lots of branches, as it
could get from three small trees. Which should it choose? If it chooses one large tree, it’ll have to carry that large piece of
wood back home, and lugging a big piece of wood 40 or 50 yards is hard work, takes a lot of energy. Of course it’ll have to
make only one trip to get the wood back to the water. On the other hand, if it goes for three small trees instead, it will take
less energy per tree to get the wood back home, but it’ll have to make three trips back and forth for the three trees. And
presumably, the more often it wanders from home, the more it’s likely to be exposed to predators. So which is better, a
single large tree or three small trees?
Another critical issue and it’s related to the first, to the size issue, is how far from the water should it go to get trees.
Should it be willing to travel a greater distance for a large tree, since it’ll get so much wood from it? Beavers certainly go
farther from the water to get an aspen tree than for an ash tree. That reflects their relative values. But what about size? Will
it travel farther for a larger tree than It will for a smaller tree?
Now I would have thought the bigger the
tree, the farther the beaver would be willing to travel for it. That would make sense, right?
If you’re going to travel far, make the trip worth it buy bringing back most wood possible.
But actually, the opposite is true. Beavers will cut down only large trees that are close to the water. They will travel far
only to cut down certain small trees that they can cut down quickly and drag back home quickly. Generally, the farther they
go from the water, the smaller the tree they will cut down. They’re willing to make more trips to haul back less wood, which
carries a greater risk of being exposed to predators. So it looks as though beavers are less interested in minimizing their
exposure to predators and more interested in saving energy when foraging for wood, which may also explain why beavers
forage primarily during the evenings.
OK, so why does their behavior indicate more of a concern with how much energy they expend than with being
exposed to predators? No one believes a beaver consciously weighs the pros and cons of each of these elements. The answer
that some give is that their behavior has evolved over time. It’s been shaped by constraints over vast stretches of time, all of
which comes down to the fact that the best foraging strategy for beavers isn’t the one that yields the most food or wood. It’s
the one that results in the most descendants, the most offspring. So let’s discuss how this idea works.
TPO 16 Lecture 4 art history
143Narrator:
Listen to part of a lecture in an art history class.
Professor
OK, now um, a sort of paradigmatic art form of the Middle Ages was stained glass art. Stained glass of course is
simply glass that has been colored and cut into pieces and re-assembled to form a picture or a decorative design. To truly
experience the beauty of this decorative glass you should see it with light passing through it, especially sunlight, which is
why stained glass is usually used for windows. But of course it has other uses, especially nowadays.
Um, anyway the art of making stained glass windows developed in Europe, urn, during the Middle Ages and was
closely related to church building. In the early 1100s a church building method was developed that reduced the stress on the
walls so more space could be used for window openings allowing for large and quite elaborate window designs.
Back then, the artists made their own glass, but first they came up with the design. Paper was scarce and expensive, so
typically they drew the design onto a white tabletop. They’d draw the principal outline but also outline the shape of each
piece of glass to be used and indicate its color.
Now in the window itself the pieces of glass would be held together by strips of lead. So in the drawing the artists
would also indicate the location of the lead strips. Then you could put a big piece of glass on the tabletop and see the design
right through it and use it to guide the cutting of the glass into smaller pieces.
Student
And the lead that was just to hold the pieces of glass together?
Professor
Well, lead is strong and flexible so it’s ideal for joining pieces of glasses cut in different shapes and sizes. But up to the
15th century the lead strips also helped create the design. They were worked into the window as part of the composition.
They were used to outline figures to show boundaries just like you might use solid lines in a pencil drawing.
Student
How did they get the color’? I mean how did they color the glass?
Professor
Well up until the 16th century stained glass was colored during the glass making process itself. You got specific colors
by adding metallic compounds to the other glass making ingredients.
So if you wanted red you added copper, if you wanted green you added iron. You just added these compounds to the
other ingredients that the glass was made of.
Student
So each piece of glass is just one color?
Professor
Yes, at least up until the 16th century. Then they started... um.. .you started to get painted glass. Painted glass windows
are still referred to as stained glass but the colors were actually painted directly onto clear glass after the glass was made. So
um ... with this kind of stained glass, you could paint a piece of glass with more than one color.
Student
And with painted glass they still used the lead strips?
Professor
144Yes, with really large windows it took more than one piece of glass, so you still needed lead strips to hold the pieces
together. But the painters actually tried to hide them. So it was different from before when the lead strips were part of the
design. And it is different, because with painted glass the idea of light corning through to create the magical effect wasn’t
the focus any more. The paintwork was.
And painted glass windows became very popular. In the 19th century, people started using them in private houses and
public buildings. Unfortunately, many of the original stained glass windows were thought to be old fashioned and they were
actually destroyed, replaced by painted glass.
Student
They actually broke them? That showed good judgment, real foresight, didn’t it?
Professor
Yes, if only they had known. Uh, and it’s not just that old stained glass is really valuable today, we lost possibly great
artwork. But luckily there was a revival of the early techniques in the mid-I 800s and artists went back to creating colored
glass and using the lead strips in their designs. The effects are much more beautiful.
In the 19th century, Louis Tiffany came up with methods to create beautiful effects without having to paint the glass.
He layered pieces of glass and used thin copper strips instead of lead, which let him make these really intricate flowery
designs for stained glass, which he used in lampshades. You’ve heard of Tiffany lampshades, right? These of course took
advantage of the new innovation of electric lighting. Electric light bulbs don’t give quite the same effect as sunlight
streaming through stained glass, but it’s close. So layered glass, Tiffany glass, became very popular and still is today.
So let’s look at some examples of different types of stained glass from each era.

OK, let’ s see. Right, Modern Stagings of a Shakespearian Classic. Well, like I told you last week, I think that’s a great
topic for you paper. So the title would be something like ... uh ...

I am not really sure, probably something like 20th
century stagings of A Midsummer
Night’s Dream.
Professor
Yes, I like that. Straightforward and to the point. So how is the research going?
Student
Well, that’s what I came to talk to you about. I was wondering if you happen to have
145a copy of the Peter Brook production of A Midsummer Night’s Dream in your video
collection. I’ve been looking for it everywhere and I am having a really hard time
tracking it down.
Professor
That’s because it doesn’t exist.
Student
You mean in your collection ? Or at all?
Professor
I mean at all. That particular production was never filmed or recorded.
Student
Oh no. I had no idea. From what I read, that production, like, it influenced every other production of the play that came
after it. So I just assumed it had been filmed or videotaped.
Professor
Oh, It definitely was a landmark production. And it’s not like it ran for just a week, but either it was never filmed or if
it was the film’s been lost. And it’ s ironic because there’s even a film about the making of the production, but none of the
production itself.
Student
So now what do I do? If there is no video.
Professor
Well, think about it. This is the most important 20th century staging of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, right?
Student
But how can I write about Brook’s interpretation of the play if I can’t see his
production.
Professor
Just because there’s no recording doesn’t mean you can’t figure out how it influenced other productions.
Student
Yeah, I guess there’s enough material around, but it will be a challenge.
Professor
True. But think about it, you are writing about dramatic arts, the theater, and that ’s the nature of theater, isn’t it?
Student
You mean because it is live, when the performance is finished ...
Professor
That’s it. Unless it’ s filmed, it’s gone. But that doesn’t mean we can’t study it. And of course some students in this
class are writing about productions in the 19th century, there are no videos of those. You know, one of the challenges for
people who study theater is to find way of talking about something that ’s really so transient, about something that, in a
146sense, doesn’t exist.
147TPO 17 Lecture 1 Art History(Prehistoric Art Dating)
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an art history class.
Professor
Good morning, ready to continue our review of prehistoric art? Today, we will be covering the Upper Paleolithic
Period, which I am roughly defining as the period from 35,000 to 8,000 BC. A lot of those cave drawings you have all seen
come from this period. But we are also be talking about portable works of art, things that could be carried around from place
to place. Here is one example. This sculpture is called the Lady with the Hood1 , and it was carved from ivory, probably a
mammoth’s tusk. Its age is a bit of a mystery. According to one source, it dates from 22,000 BC. But other sources claimed
it has been dated closer to 30,000 BC. Amy?
Amy
Why don’t we know the exact date when this head was made?
Professor
That’s a fair question. We are talking about prehistory here. So obviously the artists didn’t put a signature or a date on
anything they did. So how do we know when this figure was carved?
Tom
Last semester I took an archaeology class and we spent a lot time on, studying ways to date things. One technique I
remember was using the location of an object to date it, like how deep it was buried.
Professor
That would be Stratigraphy. Stratigraphy is used for dating portable art. When archaeologists are digging at a site, they
make very careful notes about which stratum(strata), which layer of earth they find things in. And, you know, the general
rule is that the oldest layers are at the lowest level. But this only works if the site hasn’t been touched, and the layers are
intact. A problem with this dating method is that an object could have been carried around, used for several generations
before it was discarded. So it might be much older than the layer or even the site where it was found. The stratification
technique gives us the minimum age of an object, which isn’t necessarilly its true age. Tom, in your archaeology class, did
you talk about radiocarbon dating?
Tom
Yeah, we did. That had to do with chemical analysis, something to do with measuring the amount of radiocarbon that’s
left in organic stuff. Because we know how fast radiocarbon decays, we can figure out the age of the organic material.
Professor
The key word there is organic. Is art made of organic material?
Tom
Well, you said the lady with the hood was carved out of ivory. That ’s organic.
Professor
Absolutely. Any other examples?
Amy
148Well, when they did those cave drawings. Didn’t they use, like chacoal or maybe
colors, dyes made from plants?
Professor
Fortunately, they did, at least some of the time. So it turns out that radiocarbon
dating works for a lot of prehistoric art. But again there’s a problem. This technique destroys what it analyzes, so you
have to chip off bits of the object for testing. Obviously we are reluctant to do that in some cases. And apart from that,
there’s another problems. The date tells you the age of the material, say, a bone or a tree, the object is made from, but not
the date when the artist actually created it. So, with radiocarbon dating, we get the maximum possible age for the object, but
it could be younger.
Ok, let’ s say our scientific analysis has produced an age range. Can we narrow it
down?
Amy
Could we look for similar styles or motives? You know, try to find things common to one time period.
Professor
We do that all the time. And when we see similarities in pieces of art, we assume some connection in time or place. But
is it possible that we could be imposing our own values on that analysis?
Tom
I am sorry. I don’t get your point.
Professor
Well, we have all kinds of pre-conceived ideas about how artistic styles develop. For example, a lot of people think the
presence of details demonstrates that the work was done by a more sophisticated artist. While a lack of detail suggests a
primitive style. But trends in art in the last century or so certainly challenge that idea. Don’t get me wrong though,
analyzing the styles of prehistoric art can help dating them. But we need to be careful with the idea that artistic development
occurs in a straight line, from simple to complex representations.
Amy
What you are saying is, I mean, I get the feeling that this is like a legal process, like building a legal case, the more
pieces of evidence we have, the closer we get to the truth.
Professor
Great analogy. And now you can see why we don’t have an exact date for our sculpture, the lady with the hood.
149TPO 17 Lecture 2 Environmental Science(Milankovitch Hypothesis)
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an environmental science class.
Professor
Ok, so we have been talking about theories that deal with the effects of human activity on the climate. But today I’d
like to talk a little bit about other theories that can explain variations in climate. And one of the best-known is called the
Milankovitch Hypothesis.
Now what the Milankovitch Hypothesis is about? It says that variations in earth’s movements, specifically in its orbit
around the sun, these variations lead to differences in the amount of solar energy that reaches the earth. And it is these
differences in the amount of energy that’s reaching earth from the sun, it is what causes variations in earth’s climate.
Ok, a lot of people think of earth’s orbit around the sun as being perfectly circular, as smooth and as regular as, say, the
way that hands move on a well -made watch, but it just doesn’t work that way. You are probably aware that the earth’s orbit
around the sun, it is not shaped like a perfect circle. It is more of an oval, it is elliptical. But the shape of this orbit isn’t
consistent, it varies over time, over a period of about a thousand years. Sometimes it is a little more circular, sometimes it is
more elliptical. And when earth’s orbit is more elliptical, earth is actually closer to the sun during part of the year. Which
makes earth, and in particular, the northern hemisphere, warmer. And why is that important? well, because most of the
planet’s glaciers are in the northern hemisphere, and if it gets too warm, then glaciers will stop forming. And we’ve already
talked about how that affects earth’s overall temperature.
The second movement involved in the hypothesis has to do with axial tilt. The tilt of earth’s axis, that imaginery pole
that runs through the center of the earth. And depending on the angle it tilts at, the seasons can be more or less severe. It
makes winters cooler and summers warmer, or what some might say it is doing now, it makes summers less hot, and more
importantly, the winters less cold. Which just like what I mentioned before, can also stop, prevent glaciers from forming, or
cause them to melt.
There is a third movement the hypothesis covers called precession. Precession, basically is the change in the direction
of earth’s axis of rotation. It will take me a million years to explain even just the basics of this movement as precession is
quite complex. And all these details are way beyond our scope. What’s important for you to understand is that these three
movements, well, they are cyclical, and they work together to form, to produce complex but regular variations in earth’s
climate, and lead to the growth or decline of glaciers.
Now, when Milankovitch first proposed this theory in the 1920s, many of his colleagues were skeptical. Milankovitch
didn’t have any proof. Actually there wouldn’t be any evidence to support his hypothesis until the 1970s, when
oceanographers were able to drill deep into the seafloor and collect samples, samples which were then analyzed by
geologists. And from these samples they were able to put together a history of ocean temperatures going back hundreds of
thousands of years, and this showed that earth’s climate had changed pretty much the way Milankovitch’s hypothesis
suggested it would. So this evidence was pretty strong support for the Milankovitch Hypothesis. And by the 1980s, most
people accepted this theory.
However, in the late 1980s, some scientists were exploring Devil’ s Hole, which is basically an extensive water-filled
cave, far from the ocean, in Nevada2
, in the
western United States. Over millions of years, groundwater left deposits of a mineral
150called calcite3
, on the rock within Devil’s Hole. And by studying these clacite deposits,
we can determine the climate conditions, the temperatures over the last half million
years. Well, the Devil’ s Hole findings contradicted the ones obtained during the
1970s, so basically the question was, were the ages of one or both the samples were
wrong, or were scientists misunderstanding the significance of the evidence.
Well, in the 1990s, a new study was done on the two samples. And the ocean floor
samples were found to be correct, as were the samples from Devil’s Hole. And now it
is generally believed that the sample from Devil’s Hole correspond to variations in
local climate, in the western United States, rather than global climate changes.
151TPO 17 Conversation 2
Narrator
Listen to a conversation between a student and a food service manager.
Student
Excuse me, Mrs. Hanson. My name is John, John Grant. I work as a waiter in the campus dining hall, in the faculty
dining room.
Manager
What can I do for you, John?
Student
Well, I work week nights, except for Friday. I was wondering if I could switch from working the dinner service to
working at lunch.
Manager
That’s going to be a problem. I am afraid we don’t have any openings at lunch time. A lot of students want to work
then, so it is really rare for us to have an open spot at that time of day.
Student
Oh, you see, I have joined this group, the University Jazz Band, and the band’s practice time is right around dinner
time. You know, it is so hard to get into this group, I must have auditioned like ten times since I have been at the school, so I
am ... Anyway, so I was really hoping to have the dinner hour free so I can go to practice.
Manager
Well, we do have other open times, like breakfast.
Student
Eh, that won’t work, I am sorry. I mean that, I can’t work that early. I have this very important music class I got to take,
and it is like, first thing in the morning.
Manager
Well, if you don’t mind working in the kitchen, we’ve got some pretty flexible hours for students doing food-prep work,
anything from early morning to late afternoon.
Student
What’s prep work?
Manager
You prepare food for the cooks. You know, like cutting up vegetables for soup, or cleaning greens for salads.
Student
Oh, that doesn’t sound, I mean... Being a waiter, I get to see a lot of the professors, like in a different light, we joke
around a little you know. In the classroom, they always have to be pretty formal, but ...
152Manager
Well, the money is no different since we pay students the same amount for any of the jobs here in food service, so it’s
up to you.
Student
Oh, man. I always thought that sacrificing for my art, that’d mean working long hours as a musician for, like, no money.
I didn’t think it’d mean, peeling carrots.
Manager
Let me see, I am offering you something that has the hours you want, it is right here on campus, and you make as much
money as you did being a waiter, quite a sacrifice.
Student
I am sorry, I know you are just trying to help. I guess I should look into the food-prep
job.
Manager
Ok, then, I’ll tell the kitchen manager that you will stop by tomorrow to talk about the job and schedule your hours.
And I will let the dining hall manager know that he needs to find a new waiter for the evening.
Student
Oh, ok, I guess that’ s it. Thanks, Mrs. Hanson.
153TPO 17 Lecture 3 History(Ancient Egyptian Calendar)
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a history class. The professor has been discussing ancient
Egypt.
Professor
Ok, so one of the challenges that faced ancient civilizations like Egypt was timekeeping, calendars. When you have to
grow food for whole cities of people, it is important to plant your crops at the right time. And when you start having
financial obligations, rents, taxes, you have to keep track of how often you pay.
So today we will look at how the Egyptians adressed these problems. In fact, they ended up using two calendars, one to
keep track of the natural world, or their agriculture concerns, and another one, that was used to keep track of the business
functions of the Kingdom. So let’s take a look at the hows and whys of one ancient Egyptian calendar system, starting with
the Nile River.
Why the Nile? Well, there’s no other way to put it. Egyptian life basically revolved around the mysterious rise and fall
of the river. The success of their agriculture system depended upon them knowing when the river would change. So,
naturally, their first calendar was divided up into three seasons, each based on the river ’s changes: inundation, subsidence
and harvest.
The first season was the flooding, or inundation, when the Nile valley was essentially submerged in water for a few
months or so. And afterwards during the season of subsidence, the water would subside, or recede, revealing a new layer of
fertile black silt and allowing for the planting of various crops. And finally the time of the year would arrive when the valley
would produce crops, such as wheat, barley, fruit, all ready to harvest. Ok, so it was important to the ancient Egyptians to
know when their Nile based seasons would occur, their way of life depended upon it.
Now, the way they used to count time was based on the phases of the moon, which, regularly and predictably, goes
through a cycle, starting with a new moon, then to a full moon, and back again to the new moon. Now this cycle wes then
used to determine the length of their month. So, um, one lunar cycle was one Egyptian month, and about four of the months
would constitute a season. Now, 12 of these months was an approximately 354-day year. So they had a 354-day agricultural
calendar that was designed to help them determine when the Nile would inunadate the land.
Well, of course it had to be more complicated than that. The average amount of time between floodings wasn’t actually
354 days. I mean, although it varies, the average was clearly longer than 354 days. So how did they keep this short calendar
in step with the actual flooding of the Nile?
Well, their astronomers had discovered that at a certain time of year the brightest star, Sirius, would disappear. Actually,
it’d be hidden in the glare of the Sun. And then, a couple of months later, one morning in the eartern sky just before dawn,
Sirius would reappear. And it happened regularly, about every 365 days. Even more significantly, the reappearance of Sirius
would occur around the same time as the Nile’s flooding. And this annual event is called a heliacal rising4
.The heliacal rising was a fair indicator of when the Nile would flood. The next new moon, after the heliacal rising of
Sirius, which happened in the last month of the calendar year, marked the New Year. And because the ancient Egyptians
were using the lunar cycle in combination with this heliacal rising, some years ended up having 12 lunar months, while
others had 13 lunar calender months, if Sirius didn’t rise in the 12th month.
154Even though the length of the agricultural calendar still fluctuated, with some years having 12 months and others
having 13, it ended up being much more reliable than it was before. They continually adjusted it to the heliacal rising of
Sirius, ensuring that they never got too far off in their seasons. This new calendar was ideal, because, well,
it worked well for agricultural purposes as well as for knowing when to have
traditional religious festivals. So, that was their first calendar.
But was it any way to run a government? They didn’t think so. For administrative purposes, it was very inconvenient to
have years of different lengths. So another calendar was introduced, an administrative one. Probably soon after 3,000 BC,
they declared a 365-day year, with 12 months per year, with exactly 30 days each month, with an extra 5 days at the end of
each year. This administrative calendar existed alongside the earlier agricultural and religious calendar that depended on the
heliacal rising of Sirius. This administrative calendar was much easier to use for things like scheduling taxes and other
things that had to be paid on time. Over time, the calendar got out of step with seasons and the flooding of the Nile, but for
bureaucratic purposes, they didn’t mind.
155TPO 17 Lecture 4 Biology(Octopus)
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a biology class.
Professor
Ok, now I want to talk about an animal that has a fascinating set of defense mechanisms. And that’s the octopus, one of
the unusual creatures that live in the sea. The octopus is prey to many species, including humans, so how does it escape its
predators? Well, let me back up here a second. Anyone ever heard of Proteous? Proteus was a
God in Greek mythology who could change form. He could make himself look like a lion or a stone or a tree, anything
you wanted, and he could go through a whole series of changes very quickly. Well, the octopus is the real world version of
Proteus. Just like Proteus, the octopus can go through all kinds of incredible transformations. And it does this in three ways:
by changing color, by changing its texture, and by changing its size and shape. For me, the most fascinating transformation
is when it changes its color. It’s a normal skin color, the one it generally presents, is either red or brown or even grey, and
it ’s speckled with dark spots. But when it wants to blend in with its environment to hide from its enemies, it can take on the
color of its immediate surroundings: the ocean floor, a rock, a piece of coral, whatever. Charles?
Student
Do we know how that works, I mean, how they change colors?
Professor
Well, we know that the reaction that takes place is not chemical in nature. The color changes are executed by two
different kinds of cells in the octopus ’ skin, mainly by color cells on the skin’s surface call chromatophores
5
.Chromatophores consist of tiny sacks filled with color dye. There might be a couple hundred of these color sacks per
square millimeter of the octopus ’ skin, and depending on the species, they can come in as many as five different colors.
Each one of these sacks is controlled by muscles. If the muscles are relaxed, the sack shrinks, and all you see is a little white
point. But if the muscle’s contract, then the sack expands, and you can see the colors. And by expanding different
combinations
Student
And just with various combinations of those five colors, they can recreate any color in their environment?
Professor
Well, they can no doubt create a lot with just those five colors, but you are right, maybe they can’t mimic every color
around them, so that’s where the second kind of cell comes in.
Just below the chromatophores is a layer of cells that reflect light from the environment, and these cells help the
octopus create a precise match with the colors that surround them. The colors from the color sacks are supplemented with
colors that are reflected from the environment, and that ’s how they are able to mimic colors with such precision. So, that’s
how octopus mimic colors.
But they don’t just mimic the colors in their environment; they can alos mimic the texture of objects in their
environment. They have these little projections on their skin that allow them to resemble various textures. The projections
are called
papillae6
. If the octopus wants to have a rough texture, it raises the papillae. If it wants to have a smooth texture, it flattens out
the papillae, so it can acquire a smooth texture to blend in with the sandy bottom of the sea. So the octopus has the ability to
156mimic both the color and the texture of its environment. And it’s truly amazing how well it can blend in with its
surroundings. You can easily swim within a few feet of an octopus and never see it.
Student
I read that they often hide from predators by squirting out a cloud of ink, or
something like that.
Professor
Yes. The octopus can release a cloud of ink if it feels threatened. But it doesn’t hide behind it, as is generally believed.
Um, the ink cloud is ... it serves to distract a predator while the octopus makes its escape. Um, now there’s a third way that
octopus can transform themselves to blend in with or mimic their environment, and that’s by changing their shape and size,
well, at least their apparent size. The muscular system of the octopus enables it to be very flexible to assume all sorts of
shapes and postures. So it can contract into the shape of a little round stone, and sit perfectly still on the seafloor. Or it can
nestle up in the middle of a plant and take the shape of one of the leaves. Even Proteus would be impressed, I think.

Conversation 1
A: Hi ! I hope you can help me . I just transferred from Northeastern State University near Chicago.
B: Well welcome to Central University .But Chicago is such a great city. Why did you leave?
A: Everyone asks that. It’s my hometown. And it was sure convenient to go to a school nearby. But Northeastern is still
fairly small. And it doesn’t have the program I’m interested in. I want to major in international studies. And the only
program int the State is here.
A: We do have a great program. Well how did you get interested in international studies?
B: My family hosted a few foreign exchange students while I was growing up. Then I took part in an international summer
program after I graduated from high school. I thought I really I like meeting people from all over, getting to know them.
A: OH! Ok! And that led you to our program. Right now though I think you are looking for a job.
B: Yeah, a part time job on campus. I thought I’d save money ,being away from the big city. But it doesn’t seem to be
working that way .Anyway I’m not having much luck.
A: I’m not surprised. Most of our campus jobs are taken in the first week or two of the semester. What work experience
have you had?
B: Well, I worked in the university library last year. But I already checked at the library here. They said their remaining
positions were for work-study students getting financial aid. I’ve never run into that before.
A: Well, I guess each school has its own policies. Uh, we really don’t have much right now. You might be better. If you
really want something, how are your computer skills?
B: About average I’d say. I helped teach some of the basic computer classes. Northeastern offers for new users, if that helps
any.
A: OK, The technology support department needs people to work its helpdesk. It’s basically a customer service job,
answering questions, helping people solve their computer proplems,give you a chance to develop your people skills.
B: Something every diplomat needs. But is there some problem? I mean why is the job still open?
A: Well, they have extended hours, from 6am to 2am every day. So they need a large staff. But right now they only need
people early mornings, late nights, and weekends. You’d probably end up with a bit of everything rather than a regular
spot. On the bright side you’ll probably be able to get some studying done between calls. At least it could be a start and
then you can try for better hours next semester .
B: Um, I see why the hours might be a problem. But I guess I can’t afford to be too picky if I want a job. Still maybe we can
work something out..
TPO 18 Lecture 1 Astronomy
We are going to start a study of sunspots today, and I think you’ll find it rather interesting. Now I’m going to assume
that you know that sunspots, in the most basic terms, are dark spots on the Sun’s surface. That will do for now. The ancient
158Chinese were the first to record observations of sunspots as early as the year 165. When later European astronomers wrote
about sunspots, they didn’t believe that the spots were actually on the Sun. That’s because of their belief at the time that the
heavenly bodies, the Sun, Moon, Stars, and Planets, were perfect, without any flaws or blemishes. So the opinion was the
spots were actually something else, like shadows of planets crossing the Sun’s face. And this was the thinking of European
astronomers until the introduction of the telescope, which brings us to our old friend, Galileo. In the early 1600s, based on
his observations of sunspots. Galileo proposed a new hypothesis. He pointed out that the shape of sunspots, well, the
sunspots weren’t circular. If they were shadows of the planets, they would be circular, right? So that was a problem for the
prevailing view. And he also noticed that the shape of the sunspots changed as they seemed to move across the Sun’s surface.
Maybe a particular sunspot was sort of square, then later it would become more lopsided, then later something else. So there
is another problem with the shadow hypothesis, because the shape of a planet doesn’t change. What Galileo proposed was
that sunspots were indeed a feature of the Sun, but he didn’t know what kind of feature. He proposed that they might be
clouds in the atmosphere, the solar atmosphere, especially because they seemed to change shape and there was no predicting
the changes, at least nothing Galileo could figure out. That random shape changing would be consistent with the spots being
clouds. Over the next couple hundred years, a lot of hypotheses were tossed around. The spots were mountains or holes in
the solar atmosphere through which the dark surface of the Sun could be seen. Then in 1843, astronomer named Heinrich
Schwa be made an interesting claim, Trobe had been watching the Sun every day that it was visible for 17 years, looking for
evidence of a new planet. And he started keeping tracks of sunspots, mapping them, so he wouldn’t confuse them, so he
wouldn’t confuse them with any potential new planet. In the end, there was no planet, but there was evidence that the
number of sunspots increased and decreased in a pattern, a pattern that began repeating after 10 years, and that was a huge
breakthrough. Another astronomer named Wolf kept track of the Sun for an even longer period, 40 years actually. So Wolf
did 40 years of research, and Trobe did 17 years of research. I think there is a lesson there. Anyway, Wolf went though all
records from various observatories in Europe and put together a history of sunspot observations going back about 100 years.
From this information, he was able to confirm the existence of a pattern, a repeating cycle but Wolf detected an 11-year
cycles? Dose that sound familiar to anyone? No? Well, geomagnetic activity, the natural variations in Earth’s magnetic field,
it fluctuates in 11-year cycles. Well, we’ll cover this later in this semester, but for now, well, scientists in the late 19th
century were aware of geomagnetic cycles, so when they heard that the sunspots’ cycle was also 11 years, well, they just
had to find out what was going on. Suddenly, everyone was doing studies of the possible relationship between the Sun and
the Earth. Did the sunspots cause the geomagnetic fields or did the geomagnetic fields cause the sunspots? Or is there some
other thing that caused both? And astronomers did eventually figure out what sunspots had to do with magnetic fields. And
the fact that sunspots are magnetic fields accounts for their dark appearance. That’s because magnetic fields reduce the
pressure exerted on the gases inside of them, making the spots cooler than the rest of the Sun’s surface. And since they are
cooler, they are darker.
159TPO 18 Lecture 2 Art History
A: Today we’ll continue our examination of ancient Roman sculpture. We’ve already looked at portrait sculpture which are
busts created to commemorate people who had died, and we’ve looked at relief sculpture, or sculpting on walls. And
today we’ll look at yet another category of sculpture-made copies of famous Greek sculptures.
B: Why did they do that?
A: Well no one knows for sure. You see, in the late 4th century B.C., the Romans began a campaign to expand the Roman
Empire, and in 300 years they had conquered most of the Mediterranean area and parts of Europe. You know the saying,
copies. Roman sculptors often “To the victor belong the spoils”? Well, the Roman army returned to Rome with many
works of Greek art. It’s probably fair to say that the Romans were impressed be Greek art and culture and they began
making copies of the Greek statues. Now the dominant view in traditional art his that Roman artists lacked creativity
and skill especially compared to the Greek artists who came before them. Essentially, the traditional view, a view that’s
been prevalent for over 250 years, is that the Romans copied Greek sculptures because they couldn’t create sculpture of
their own. But finally some contemporary art historians have challenged this view. One is Elaine Gazda . Gazda says
that there might be other reasons that Romans made copies. She wasn’t convinced that it was because of a lack of
creativity. Can anyone think of another possible reason? Well maybe they just admired these sculptures. You know, they
liked the way they looked. Yes. That’s one of Gazda’s points. Another is that while nowadays reproduction is easy, it
was not so easy in Roman times. Copying statues required a lot of skill, time and effort. So Gazda hypothesizes that
copying didn’t indicate a lack of artistic imagination or skill on the part of Roman artists, but rather the Romans made
copies because they admired Greek sculpture. Classical Greek statues represented an idealization of the human body and
were considered quite beautiful at the time. Gazda also believes that it’s been a mistake to dismiss the Roman copies as,
well, copies for copy’s sake and not to consider the Roman function and meaning of the statues.
B: What do you mean the Roman function? Weren’t they just for decoration?
A: Well, not necessarily. Under the Emperor Augustus at the height of the Roman Empire, portrait statues were sent
throughout the empire. They were supposed to communicate specific ideas about the emperor and the imperial family
and to help inhabitants of the conquered areas become familiar with the Roman coins were also distributed throughout
the empire. Anybody care to guess what was on them?
The emperor’s face? That’s right! The coins were easy to distribute and they allowed people to see the emperor or at least
his likes and served as an additional reminder to let them know, well, who was in charge. And the images helped people
become familiar with the emperor. Statues of him in different roles were sent all over the empire. Now, actually some
Roman sculptures were original but others were exact copies of Greek statues and some Roman sculptures were
combinations of some sort. Some combined more than one Greek statue and others combined a Greek god or an athlete
with a Roman’s head. At the time of Julius Caesar, I wasn’t uncommon to create statues that had the body of a god and
the head of an emperor. And the Romans were clever. What they did was they made plaster casts from molds of the
sculptures. Then they shipped these plaster casts to workshops all over the empire, where they were replicated in marble
or bronze. And on some statues the heads were removable. They could put an emperor’s head on different bodies,
showing him doing different things. And then later when then time came they could even use the head of the next
160emperor on the same body.
161TPO 18 Conversation 2
A: Well, I’m glad you redid your outline. I fed a few comments, but nothing you have to act on. It’s in good enough shape
for you to start writing you paper.
B: Thanks! At first I was afraid all that prep work would be a waste of time.
A: Well, especially with a challenging topic like yours: factors leading to the emergence of sociology as an academic
discipline. There’s just so much history to consider; you could get lost without a solid outline. So did you have a
question?
B: Yeah, it’s about…you mentioned needing volunteers for a research study?
A: Yep, it’s not my study. It’s my colleague’s in the marketing department. She needs people to watch various new TV
programs that haven’t been broadcast yet, then indicate on a survey whether they liked it, why, if they’d watch another
episode. It’d be kind of fun plus participants get a $50 gift certificate.
B: Wow, well I like the sound of that. But…so they are trying to predict if the shows are gonna succeed or fail, right, based
on students’ opinions? Why would they care what we think?
A: Hey, don’t sell yourself short. People your age are a very attractive market for advertisers who promote their products on
television. The study is sponsored by a TV network. If enough students don’t like the show, the network may actually
reconsider putting it on the air.
B: OK, well, how do I sign up?
A: You just add your name and phone number to this list and check a time slot, although it looks like the only times left are
next Monday morning and Thursday evening.
B: Oh, well, I have marketing and economics Monday mornings and Thursday.
A: OH, you are taking the marketing class? Who’s teaching it?
B: It’s Professor Largin - Intro to Marketing. Hr hasn’t mentioned the study though.
A: Oh, well, the marketing department’s pretty big. I happen to be friends with a woman who is doing the TV study. Ok,
well, we don’t want you missing class. How’s Thursday?
B: Oh, I work from 5 till 9 that night. Hmm, no flexibility with your schedule? Where do you work?
A: Oh, I like Fox’s. I eat there every week. Maybe you could switch shifts with someone.
B: I’m still in training. And the only night my trainer works is Thursday. Look!
A: I know the owners there really well. Why don’t you let me give them a call and explain the situation?
B: OK! It’d be cool to be part of a real research study. And the gift certificate wouldn’t hurt either.
TPO 18 Lecture 3 European History
In order to really study the social history of the Middle Ages, you have to understand the role of spices. Now, this
might sound a little spurring, even a little strange. But what seem like little things now were back then actually rather big
things. So first let’s define what a spice is. Technically speaking, a spice is part of an aromatic plant that is not a leaf or herb.
162Spices can come from tree bark like cinnamon, plant roots like ginger, flower buds like cloves. And in the Middle Ages.
Europeans were familiar with lots of different spices, most important being pepper, cloves, ginger, cinnamon, maize and
nutmeg. These spices literarily dominated the way Europeans lived for centuries, how they traded and even how they used
their imaginations. So why this medieval fascination with spices? We can boil it down to there general ideas briefly. One
was cost and rarity. Uh two was exotic taste and fragrance. And third, mysterious origins and kinds of mythical status. Now
for cost and rarity, spices aren’t native to Europe and they had to be imported. Spices only grew in the East Indies and of
course transportation costs were incredibly valuable even from the very beginning. Here is an example. In 408 AD, the
Gothic General who captured Rome demanded payment. He wanted 5000 pounds of gold among other things but he also
wanted 3000 pounds of pepper. Maybe that would give you an idea of exactly where pepper stood at the time. By the
Middle Ages, spices were regarded as so important and expensive they were used in diplomacy, as gifts by heads of state
and ambassadors. Now for the taste. The diet then was relatively bland, compared to today’s. There wasn’t much variety.
Especially the aristocracy who tended to eat a lot of meat, they were always looking for new ways to prepare it, new sources,
new tastes and this is where spices came in. Now, this is a good point to mention one of the biggest myths about spices. It’s
commonly said that medieval Europeans wanted spices to cover up the taste of spoiled meat. But this isn’t really true.
Anyone who had to worry about spoiled meat couldn’t afford spices in the first place. If you could afford spices, you could
definitely afford fresh meat. We also have evidence that various medieval markets employed a kind of police to make sure
that people did not sell spoiled food, and if you were caught doing it, you were subject to various fines, humiliating public
punishments. So what actually was true was this: In order to have meat for the winter, people would preserve it in salt, not a
spice. Spices actually aren’t very effective as preservatives. And throughout winter, they would eat salted meat, but the taste
of the stuff could grow really boring and depressing after a while. So the cook started looking for new ways to improve the
taste and spices were the answer, which brings us to mysterious origins and mythical status. Now the ancient Romans had a
thriving spice trade and they sent their ships to the east and back. But when Rome collapsed in the fifth century and the
Middle Ages began, direct trade stopped, and so did that kind of hands-on knowledge of travel and geography. Spices now
came by way of the trade routes with lots of intermediaries between the producer and the consumer. So these spices took on
an air of mystery. Their origins were shrouded in exotic travels. They had the allure of the unknown, of wild places. Myths
grew up of fantasy lands, magical faraway places made entirely of food and spices. And to that, spices themselves had
always been considered special or magical not just for eating and this was already true in the ancient world where legends
about spices were abundant. Spices inspired the medieval imagination. They were used as medicines to ward off diseases,
and mixed into perfumes, incent. They were used in religious rituals for thousands of years. They took on a life of their own
and they inspired the medieval imagination, spurred on the age of discovery in the 145th and 16th centuries. When famous
explorers like Columbus and da Gama and Magellan left Europe in their ships, they weren’t looking for a new world.; they
were looking for spices. And we know what important historical repercussions some of those voyages had.
163TPO 18 Lecture 4 Biology
A：Well, it’s finally looking like spring is arriving. The last of the winter snow would be melting away in a few days. So
before we close today, I thought I’d mention a biological event that’s a part of the transition from winter to spring,
something you can go outside and watch if you have some patience. There is a small creature that lives in this area;
you’ve probably seen it. It’s the North American wood frog. Now the wood frog’s not that easy tosspot since it stays
pretty to close to the ground, under leaves and things and it blends in really well with its background as you can see.
But they are worth the effort because they do something very unusual, something you might not have even thought
possible. OK North American wood frogs live over a very broad territory or range. They’re found all over the
northeastern United States and all through Canada and Alaska, even inside the Arctic Circle. No other frog is able to
live that far and north. But wherever they live, once the weather starts to turn cold and the temperature starts to drop
below freezing, as soon as the frog even touches an ice crystal or a bit of frozen ground, well, it begins to freeze.
Yeah...yes to me. You look a little bit taken aback.
B: Wait, you mean it’s still alive but it freezes, solid?
A: Well, almost. Ice forms in all the spaces outside the cells but never within a cell.
B: But… then how does its heart beat?
A: It doesn’t.
B: But…then how could it…….
A: You are gonna do such a thing? Well, that first touch of ice apparently triggers a biological response inside the frog. That
first of all starts drawing water away from the center of its body, so the middle part of the frog, its internal organs, its
heart, lungs, liver, these start getting drier and drier while the water that’s being pulled away is forming a puddle around
the organs just underneath the skin. And then that puddle of water starts to freeze. OK, up to known, the frog’s heart is
still beating, right? Slower and slower but…and in those last few hours before it freezes, it distributes glucose, a blood
sugar throughout its body, its circulatory system, sort of acts like an an antifreeze.
B: A solution of antifreeze like you put in your car in the winter?
A: Well, you tell me. In frogs, the extra glucose makes it harder for the winter inside the cells to freeze. So the cells stay just
slightly wet, enough so that they can survive the winter. Then after that, the heart stops beating altogether. So is that the
same?
B: I don’t really know, but how long dose it stay that way?
A: Well, it could be days or months, all winter in fact but umm, see the heart really doesn’t need to do any pumping now
because the blood is frozen too.
B: I just, I guess I just don’t see how it isn’t, you know, clinically dead.
A: Well, that’s the amazing thing and how it revives is pretty amazing too. After months without a heartbeat, spring time
came around again, the earth starts to warm up and suddenly one day, ping, a pulse, followed by another one, then
another until maybe ten, twelve hours later, the animal is fully recovered.
B: And does the thawing process have some kind of trigger as well?
A: Well, we are not sure actually, the clearer thing is even though the sun is warning the frog up on the outside, its inside
164thaw out first, the heart and brain and everything. But somehow it all just happens that way every spring.
B: But after they thaw does it affect them like their lifespan?
A: Well, hmm, we really don’t know a lot about how long a wood frog normally lives, probably just a few years but there is
no evidence its longevity. It does have some other impacts though. In studies, we found that when it comes to
reproduction, freezing diminishes the mating performance of males. After they’ve been frozen and thawed of course,
they don’t seem quite as vocal. They move slower and they seem to have a harder time recognizing a potential mate. So
if the male frog could manage not to go through this freezing cycle, he’d probably have more success in mating.

Conversation 1
Listen to a conversation between a student and the professor.
Student
Hi, professor Handerson. That was a really interesting lecture in class today.
Professor
Thanks, Tom. Yeah, animals’ use of deception, ways they play tricks on other animals, that’s a fascinating area. One we are really just starting to understand.
Student
Yeah, you know, selective adaptations over time are one thing. Oh, like, non-poisonous butterflies, that have
come to look like poisonous ones. But the idea that animals of the same species intentionally deceive each other,
I have never heard that before.
Professor
Right, like, there are male frogs who lower their voices and end up sounding bigger than they really are.
Student
So they do that to keep other frogs from invading their territory ?
Professor
Right, bigger frogs have deeper voices, so if a smaller frog can imitate that deep voice. Well ...
Student
Yeah, I can see how that might do the trick. But, anyway, what I wanted to ask was, when you started talking
about game theory. Well, I know a little bit about it, but I am not clear about its use in biology.
Professor
3
Yeah, it is fairly new to biology. Basically, it uses math to predict what an individual would do under certain
circumstances. But for example, a buisness sells, oh computer, say, and they want to sell their computers to a big
university. But there is another company bidding too. So, what should they do?
Student
Well, try to offer the lowest price so they can compete, but still make money.
Professor
Right, they are competing, like a game, like the frogs. There are risks with pricing too high, the other company
might get the sale, there is also the number and types of computers to consider. Each company has to find a
balance between the cost and benefits. Well, game theory creates mathematical models that analyze different
conditions like this to predict outcomes.
Student
Ok, I get that. But how does it apply to animals ?
166Professor
Well, you know, if you are interested in this topic, it would be perfect for your term paper.
Student
The literature review ?
Professor
Yeah, find three journal articles about this or another topic that interests you and discuss them. If there is a
confict in the conclusions or something, that would be important to discuss.
Student
Well, from what I have looked at dealing with game theory, I can’t say I understand much of the statistics end.
Professor
Well, I can point you to some that presents fairly basic studies, that don’t assume much background knowledge.
You’ll just need to answer a few specific questions: What was the researchers’ hypothesis? What did they want to find
out? And how did they conduct their research? An then the conclusions they came to. Learning to
interpret these statistics will come later.
167TPO 19 Lecture 1 Linguistics(Proto-Indo-European)
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a linguistics class.
Professor
All right, so far we have been looking at some of the core areas of linguistics, like syntax, phonology, semantics,
and these are things that we can study by looking at one language at a time, how sounds, and words, and
sentences work in a given language. But the branch of historical linguistics, involves the comparison of several
different languages, or the comparison of different stages of a single language.
Now, if you are comparing different languages, and you notice that they have a lot in common. Maybe they have
similar sounds and words that correspond to one another that have the same meaning and that sound similar.
Let’s use a real-world example. In the 18th century, scholars who have studied the ancient languages, Sanskrit, Latin
and Greek, noticed that these three languages had many similarities. And there might be several reasons why languages such
as these had so much in common. Maybe it happened by chance, maybe one language was heavily influenced by borrowed
words from the other. Or maybe, maybe the languages developed from the same source language long ago, that is, maybe
they are genetically related, that was what happened with Sanskrit, Latin and Greek. These languages had so many
similarities that it was concluded that they must have all come from the same source. And talk about important discoveries
in linguistics, this was certainly one of them.
The scholars referred to that source language as Proto-Indo-European, Proto-Indo-European is a reconstructed
language. Meaning, it is what linguists concluded a parent language of Sanskrit, Latin and Greek would have to be like. And
Proto-Indo-European branched out into other languages, which evolved into others, so in the end, many languages spoken
all over the world today can trace their ancestry back to one language, Proto-Indo-European, which was spoken several
thousand years ago.
Now, one way of representing the evolution of languages, showing the way languages are related to each other, is with
the family tree model. Like a family tree that you might use to trace back through generations of ancestors, only it’s
showing a family of geneticall related languages instead of people. A tree model for a language family starts with one
language, which we call a mother language, for example, Proto-Indo-European. The mother language, is the line on the top
of this diagram, over time, it branches off into new daughter languages, which branch into daughter languages of their own,
and languages that have the same source, the same mother, are called sisters, they share a lot of characteristics, and this
went on until we are looking at a big upside down tree languages like this. It is incomplete of course, just to give you an
idea. So that’s the family tree model, basically.
Now, the tree model is a convenient way of representing the development of a language family and of showing how
closely related two of more languages are. But it is obviously very simplified, having a whole language represented by just
one branch on a tree doesn’t really do justice to all the variations within that language. You know, Spanish that spoken in
Spain isn’t exactly the same as Spanish that is spoken in Mexico, for example.
Another issue is that languages evolve very gradually, but the tree model makes it look like they evolve over night,like
there was a distinct moment in time when a mother language clearly broke off into daughter languages. But it seems to me it
probably wasn’t quite like that.
168TPO 19 Lecture 2 Astronomy(Radio Astronomy & Optical Astronomy)
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an astronomy class.
Professor
So how many of you have seen the Milky Way, the Milky Galaxy in the sky? You, you have?
Student
Yeah, I was camping, and there was no moon that night, it was super dark.
Professor
Anybody else? Not too many. Isn’t that strange that the Milky Way is the galaxy that the planet earth is in, and most of
us have never seen it? Now, what’s the problem here?
Student
Light pollution, right? From street lights and stuff ...
Professor
Yes, Especially unshielded street light, you know, ones that aren’t pointed downward. Now, here’s an irony, the buiding
we are in now, the astronomy building not far from our observatory, has unshielded lights.
Student
So the problem is pretty widespread.
Professor
It is basically beyond control, as far as expecting to view the night sky anywhere near city, I mean. I have lived around
here my whole life. And I have never seen the Milky Way within city limits, and I probably never will. There is a price for
progress, eh? But let’s think beyond light pullution, that’s only one kind of a technological advance that has interfered with
astronomical research.
Can anyone think of another? No? Ok, let’s look at it this way, we don’t only gain information by looking at the stars,
for the past 70 years or so, we have also used radio astronomy1 , which lets us study radio waves from the sky.
Student
How can you observe radio waves? I mean, tell anything about the stars from that.
Professor
Well, in optical astronomy, using a telescope and observing the stars that way, we rely on visible light waves. What we
are seeing from earth is actually electromagnetic radiation that’s coming from stars. And just one part of it is visible light.
But there are problems with that. When photons2 and light waves hit objects in our atmosphere, water droplets, oxygen and
nitrogen molecules, dust particles and so on. These objects are illuminated, they are lit up, and those things are also being lit
by all our street lights, by the moon, all these ambient light. And on top of that, when that visible radiation bounces off those
molecules, it scatters in all directions. And well, light from stars, even nearby in our own galaxy, doesn’t stand a chance
against that. Basically the light bouncing off all these objects close to earth is brighter than what’s coming from the stars.
Now, radiowaves are electromagnetic radiation that we can’t see. Nearly all astronomical objects in space emit radio
169waves, whether nearby stars, objects in far away galaxies, they all give off radio waves. And unlike visible light waves,
these radio waves can get through the various gases and dusts in space, and through our own earth’s atmosphere
comparatively easily.
Student
Ok, then we might as well give up on optical astronomy and go with radio astronomy.
Professor
Well, the thing is, with the radio astronomy, you can’t just set up a telescope in you backyard and observe stars.
One problem is that radio waves from these far away objects, even though they can get through, are extremely
faint. So we need to use radio telescopes, specially designed to receive these waves and then, well, we can use
computers to create pictures based on the information we receive.
Student
That sounds cool. So, how do they do that?
Professor
Well, it is kind of like the same way a satellite dish3
receives its signal, if you are familiar with that. But radio
telescopes are sometimes grouped together, is the same effect as having one big telescope to increase radio
wave gathering power. And they use electronics, quite sophisticated. Yeah, it is neat how they do it, but for now
why don’t we just stick with what we can learn from it. Some very important discoveries have been made by this
technology, especially you consider that some objects in space give off radio waves but don’t emit any light. We
have trouble discovering those sorts of bodies, much less studying them using just optical telescopes.
Student
Well, If the radio waves are so good at getting throught the universe, what’s the problem?
Professor
Well, answer this. How come people have to turn off their cell phones and all our electronic devices when an
airplane is about to take off?
Student
The phones interfere with the radio communication at the airport, right?
Student
Oh, so our radio waves here on earth interfere with the waves from space?
Professor
Yes, signal from radios, cell phones, TV stations, remote controls, you name it. All these things cause interference.
We don’t think about that as often as we think about light pollution. But all those electrical gauges pollute the
skies, just in a differen way.
170TPO 19 Conversation 2
Narrator
Listen to a conversation between a student and the director of the student cafeteria.
Student
Hi, I... I am sorry to interrupt, could I ask you a few questions?
Director
Sure, but if it is about you meal plan, you’ll need to go to Room 45, just down the hall.
Student
Eh, no, I am OK with my meal plan. I am actually here about the food in the student cafeteria.
Director
Oh, we do feed a lot of students, so we can’t always honor individual requests. I am sure you understand.
Student
Of course. It is just that I am a little concerned, I mean, a lot of us are, that a lot of the food you serve isn’t really that
healthy. Like there are so many deep-fried foods.
Director
As a matter of fact, we recently changed the type of oil we use in our fryer . It is the healthiest available. And would
you believe that at least ten students have already complaint that their french fries and fried chicken don’t taste as good
since we switched?
Student
Oh, I try not to eat too many fried foods anyway. I am just aware that, eh...You see, I used to work in a natural food
store. They had all these literature4 advising people to eat fresh organic growing food. Working there really open my eyes.
Director
Did you come to the organic food festival we had to celebrate Earth Day?
Student
Oh, sorry, I must have missed that.
Director
We served only certified organic food, most of which was from local farms. It is not something we can afford to do on
a daily basis, and there aren’t too many organic farms around here. But sometime the produce we offer is organically grown.
It depends on the season and the prices of course.
Student
That’s good to know. I like the fact that organic farms don’t use chemical pesticides or anything that can pollute the
soil or the water.
Director
I do too. But let me ask you this. Is it better to buy locally grown produce that is not certified as organic or is it better to
171get organically grown fruits and vegetables that must be trucked in from California, three thousand mile away. What about
fossile fuels burned by the trucks’ engine. Plus the expense of shipping food across long distances. And nutritionally
speaking, an apple is an apple however it is grown.
Student
I see your point. It is not so clear-cut.
Director
Why don’t you visit our cafeteria’s website? We list all our food suppliers. You know, where we buy the food that we
serve. And the site also suggests ways to make your overall diet a healthy one. You can also find some charts listing fat and
calorie content for different types of seafood, meat and the other major food groups.
Student
I didn’t realize you thought about all these things so carefully, I just noticed the high-calorie food in the cafeteria.
Director
Well, we have to give choices so everyone is satisfied. But if you wish to pursue this further, I suggest that you talk to
my boss.
Student
That’s OK, seems like you are doing what you can.
172TPO 19 Lecture 3 Marine Biology(Plant Life in Salt Marshes)
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a marine biology class.
Professor
Ok, today we are going to continue our discussion of plant life in coastal salt marshes
5 of North America. Salt marshes are among the least inviting environments for plants. The water is salty, there is little
shade and the ocean tide comes in and out, constantly flooding the marsh, so the variety of plants found in salt marshes is
limited, but there is a plant genus that thrives there, the Spartina. In fact, the Spartina genus is the dominant plant found in
salt marshes. You can find one type of the Spartina, Saltmarsh Cordgrass, growing in low marsh areas. In higher marsh
areas, you are likely to find a Spartina commonly called Salt-meadow Hay. So how is the Spartina able to survive in an
envrionment that would kill most plants? well, it is because salt marsh grasses have found ways to adapt to the conditions
there.
First of all, they are able to withstand highly saline conditions. One really interesting adaptation is the ability to reverse
the process of osmosis6
. Typically, the process of osmosis works... Well, when water moves through the wall of a plant cell, it will move fromthe side containing water with the lowest amount of salt into the side containing the highest amount of salt. so imagine what
would happen if a typical plant suddenly found itself in salt water, the water contained in the plant cells, that is water with
very little salt would be drawn out toward the seawater, water with a lot of salt. So you can see the fresh water contained in
the plant will be removed and the plant will quickly lose all its water and dehydrate. But what about the Spartinas, well,
they allow a certain amount of salt to enter their cells, bringing the salt content of the water within the plant, to a slightly
higher concentration than that of the surrounding seawater. So instead of fresh water moving out of the plant cells, salt fromthe seawater enters, reverse osmosis, and this actually strengthens the cells.
Another adaptation to the salty environment is the ability to excrete excess salt back to the environment. That’s why
you might see a Spartina shimmering in the sunlight. What’s reflecting the light is not salt from seawater that has evaporated,
although that’s a good guess. But it is actually the salt that came from within the plant. Pretty cool, eh? You can really
impress your friends and family with that little ? the next time you are in a salt marsh.
But coping with salt is not the only challenge for plants in the salt marsh. Soil there is dense and very low in oxygen,
so Spartinas have air tubes, air enters through tiny openings on the leaves, the tubes provide direct pipe line for oxygen,
carrying it down the leaves through the stems and into the roots, where it is needed. If you pull up a Spartina, you might
even notice some reddish mud on some of the roots, this is caused by oxygen reacting with iron sulfide in the soil, and it
produces iron oxide or rust.
Now, although the Spartinas have adapted several chemical and physical mechanisms that allow them to thrive in salt
water and to feed oxygen to their roots. There is yet another aspect of the harsh environment that they have to adapt to, the
force of tides and occasional violent storms. Wind and water are constantly crashing into these plants. So as you might have
guessed, they have developed a means of solidly anchoring themselves into the soil. How? They have tough sort of
underground stems called rhizome, rhizomes from one plant grow through the muddy soil and interlock with those of other
nearby plants, the plants form a kind of colony, a community that will thrive and perish together. Because alone as single
plants, they cannot survive. \
173Of course the plants in these colonies also need tough resilient stems above the soil, stems that can bent a lot but not
break as water constantly crashes into them. So in addtion to the interlocking underground rhizomes, they have yet another
adaptation, and it is ... well, we are back to reverse osmosis again, by adjusting the osmotic pressure so that the cells are
always fully inflated, the plant is able to withstand great pressure befor snapping, so Spartinas may look like simple marsh
grass, but they are really a wonder of chemistry, physics and structural engineering that allows them to survive and even
thrive in an evironment in which most plants will wilt7 and die within hours.

174TPO 19 Lecture 4 Art History(Cecilia Beaux)
Narrator: Listen to part of a discussion in an art history class.
Professor: All right, let’s continue our discussion of portrait artists(portraitist) and portraiture. Who remembers any of
the important points we made last time? Sandra?
Student: Well, artists have done portraits of people for centuries, of famous people and regular people, and most
portraits convey the artists’ personal vision, like their feelings and insights about a person.
Professor: Great, that’s a crucial point, and I’d like to explore that a little today. A great example of that, that vision in
portraiture, is Cecilia Beaux. Cecilia Beaux was born in 1854, and after learning to paint and studying with several
important artists of the time, Beaux became known as one of the best portrait painters in the United States. She was very
successful. She even had portraits of the wife and children of Theodore Roosevelt, while he was president. Some did not get
much more prestige than that. Now, those portraits also reflect the kind of subjects that Beaux tended to use, which were
mostly women and children. For example, in her first major work, her subjects were ..., the painting featured her sister and
her nephew. Yes, Mark?
Student
Yeah, it just seems interesting. I was wondering if that was unusual to have a portrait artist who is a woman become so
well-known and successful in the 19th century.
Professor
Great question. Yeah, she really stood out back in the 1800s. And today, she is still considered one of the greatest
portrait painters of her time, male or female. In fact, she was the first full-time female instructor at the Pennsylvania
Academy of the Fine Arts, and she was a full member of the National Academy of Design. These are pretty important
institutions, so, yeah, she definitely made headway for women artists. Ok, so let’s look at one of her portraits now, this
painting is called The Dreamer. It is one of my favorites. And I think it is especially characteristic of Beaux’s work. So what
you see here is a portrait of a close friend of Cecilia Beaux. So tell me what’s the first thing that draws you to this painting?
What catches your eye first.
Student
Well, for me, it is her face and hands, I think they are really expressive, and also, they make the woman seem very
comtemplative, seems like she is thinking pretty seriously about something.
Student
Yeah, her eyes kind of draw you in. But what strikes me is the contrasting colors, the white dress and the dark
background. It kind of reminds me of that painting we discussed a few weeks ago, by ...eh... John Singer Sargent. I think it
was called MadameX?
Professor
I agree, good point. Yes, Beaux had high regard for Sargent’s work. And this is something, a technique you will find in
both of their work. Ok, but the painting is called The Dreamer. What do you see is dreamlike about it?
Student
Well, the background behind the woman is pretty vague. Like, maybe there is no real context, like no definite
surroundings, expecially compared to the woman herself, since she is so clear and well-defined.
175Professor
Yes, the unclear background definitely contributes to that dreaminess. It is meant to show a sense of isolation I think.
With the woman is deep in a daydream and not really aware of anything eale. This painting shows how insightful Cecilia
Beaux was as a portrait artist. Besides her excellent technical skills, like her use of brush strokes and color to make an
impression, both respectives come through. Her portraits reveal her own interpretation of her subject’s state of mind. This is
what it is all about, not just likenesses
8
.Now, the undefined background also shows how Cecilia Beaux was influenced by the French Impressionists, who
believed, like Beaux, in a personal rather than conventional approach to their subject matter. Beaux used some impressionist
techniques and share much of their phylosophy, but her style, it was all her own.

176Eh... Ok, yeah. It’s been recalled. You can keep it all year as long as no one else requests it, but someone else has, it
looks like one of the professors in the sociology department. So you have to bring it back. You can check it out again when
it is returned in a couple of weeks.
What if the person renews it? And I really need it right now.
Librarian
All of it? Or is there a certain section or chapter you are working with?
Student
Well, there’s one chapter in particular I am working with, but why?
Librarian
Well, we normally don’t do this, but because of the circumstances we can photocopy up to one chapter for you. Why
don’t you do that for the one you are working with right now? And by the time you need the rest of the book, maybe it’ll
have been returned.
Student
Oh, that would be great.
Librarian
Do you have it with you?
Student
Eh... no, it’s in my dorm room. These are books I want to check out today. Is it OK if I bring that one by in a couple of
days?
Librarian
Actually, the due day is tomorrow. After that, there’ll be a two dollar per day fine. But you need to return it today if
you want to check out any books today. That’s our policy.
Student
Oh, I see.
Librarian
Yeah, not a lot of people realize that. In fact, every semester we get a few students who would have their borrowing
privileges suspended completely because they haven’t returned books. They are allowed to use books only in the library.
They are not allowed to check anything out because of unreturned books.
That’s not good. I guess I should head back to the dorm right now.
Librarian
But before you go, what you should do is fill out a form requesting the book back in two weeks. Then the person who
requested it won’t be able to renew it. You’ll get it back quickly.
Student
I’ll do that right now.
177TPO20 Lecture1-Linguistics(Gricean Maxims)
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a linguistics class.
Professor
Ok, the conventions or assumptions that govern conversation, these may vary from one culture to another , but
basically, for people to communicate, there is a ... they have to follow certain rules. Like if I am talking with you and I start
saying things that are not true, if you can’t tell when I am lying and when I am telling the truth, well, we are not going to
have a very satisfactory conversation, are we? Why? Because it violates one of the Gricean Maxims, that’s a set of rules or
maxims a philosopher name H.P .Grice came up with in 1970s. One of these Gricean Maxims is... well, I’ve already given
you a hint.
Student
Oh, you just can’t go around telling lies.
Professor
Right, or as Grice put it, “Do not say what you believe to be false.” That’s one of Grice’s Maxims of Quality as he
called it. So that’s pretty obvious. But there are others just as important. Like, eh... suppose you would ask me what time it
was and I replied ‘my sister just got married’ , what would you think?
Student
You are not really answering my question.
Professor
No, I am not, am I? There is no connection at all, which feels wrong because you generally expect to find one. So one
important maxim is simply: be relevant. And using the so-called Maxim of Relevance we can infer things as well, or rather
the speaker can imply things and the listener can make inferences. For instance, suppose you say you would really love to
have a cup of coffee right now, and I say ‘there’s a shop around the corner’ . Now, what can you infer from what I said?
Student
Well, the shop sells coffee for one thing.
Professor
Right, and that I believe it is open now. Because if I won’t implying those things, my response would not be relevant.
It’d have no connection with what you said before. But according to the maxim, my response should be relevant to your
statement, meaning, we should assume some connection between the statement and the response. And this maxim of
relevance is quite efficient to use. Even if I don’t spell out all the details, you can still make some useful logical inferences,
namely, the shop is open and it sells coffee. If we actually have to explain all these details, conversations would move along
pretty slowly, wouldn’t they?
OK, then there’s the maxims of manner, including things like be clear , and avoid ambiguity.
178And another more interesting maxims is one of the so-called maxims of quantity, quantities of information, that is. It
says, to give as much as is required in the situation. So suppose you asked me what I did yesterday and I say ‘I went to the
Art Museum.’ You would likely infer that I saw some works of art. Suppose, though, that I did not go inside the museum, I
just walked up to it then left. Then I violated the quantity maxim by not giving enough information. So you can see how
important implications are to our ability to carry on a conversation.
But there are times when people will violate these maxims on purpose. Let’s say a boss is asked to write a letter of
recommendation for a former employee seeking an engineering job. The letter he writes is quite brief. Something like, uh,
Mr . X is polite and always dresses quite neatly. So what does this really mean?
Student
Oh, I see. By not mentioning any important qualities related to the job, the boss is ... like, implying that this is best that
can be said about Mr . X that he is really not qualified.
Professor
Exactly. It’s a written letter not a conversation, but the principle is the same. The boss is conveying a negative
impression of Mr . X without actually saying negative about him. So, by violating the maxims, we ...eh... but ... it can be a
way to be subtle or polite, or to convey humor through sarcasm or irony.
Sometimes though people will violate maxims for another purpose: to deceive. Now, can you imagine who might do
such a thing?
Student
Some politicians.
Student
Or advertisers.
Professor
Right. Anyone who may see an advantage in implying certain things that are untrue without explicitly saying
something untrue. They think, hey, don’t blame us if our audience happens to draw inferences that are simply not true. So
next time you see an advertisement saying some product could be up to 20% more effective, think of these maxims of
quantity and relevance, and ask yourself what inferences you are being led to draw. Think, more effective than what exactly?
And why do they use those little phrases ‘could be’ and ‘up to’? These claims give us a lot less information than they seemto.
TPO20 Lecture2-Environmental Science(Interglacial Periods)
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an environmental science class.
179Professor
I’d like to take you back about 11 thousand years ago when Earth entered the latest interglacial period. Interglacial
periods are, typically periods of time between Ice Ages, when the climate warms, and the glacial ice retreats for a time,
before things cool off again and another Ice Age begins. And for over the past several million years, Earth’s sort of default
climate has actually been Ice Age, but we have experienced periodic regular thaws, and the last one, the one we are in now,
started about 11 thousand years ago.
Now, the typical pattern for an interglacial period, and we have studied several, is that the concentration of carbon
dioxide and methane gas actually reaches it... its peak, that is, there is the most carbon dioxide and methane gas, uh,
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere just after the beginning of the interglacial period. And then, for reasons which are not
entirely clear , the concentration of greenhouse gases gradually goes down. Now, the climate continues to warm for a while
because there is a lag effect. But uh, gradually as the concentration of greenhouse gases goes down, Earth starts to cool
again, and eventually you slip back into an Ice Age.
Um, however , for the latest interglacial period, the one we are in now, this pattern did not hold, that is, the
concentration of carbon dioxide and methane dipped1 a little bit after, uh, uh, after peaking at the beginning, near the
beginning of the interglacial period, but then it began to rise again. Um ... What was different about this interglacial period
than the other ones?
Well, one of the big differences is human activity. People began to raise crops and animals for food instead of hunting
for them. This is the agricultural revolution. And it began to happen in the earliest stages about 11 thousand years ago.
Now, scientists have tended to regard ... the ... uh ... agricultural revolution as a beneficiary of the ... uh ... fortuitous
shift in climate. However , some new theories of climate, new theorists of climate have proposed that perhaps humanity was
having an effect on the climate as far back as the beginnings of the agricultural revolution. When you grow crops and uh,
pasture your animals , one of the things you do is you cut down the forests. If you cut down the forests, when you burn the
trees for fuel and don’t replace them with other trees, or when you just leave them to rot and don’t allow other trees to grow,
you end up with a lot more carbon in the form of carbon dioxide getting into the atmosphere.
Um ... another gas associated with the spread of agriculture is methane. Methane forms in large concentration above
wetlands, and as it turns out, the cultivation of certain grains creates vast areas of artificial wetlands, and probably
drastically increases the amount of methane getting into the atmosphere, over and above what would be there.
So, um... agriculture, the ... the spread of agriculture, you know we are talking over thousands of years, um... but this
could very well had a profound effect on the composition of Earth’s atmosphere. It’s kind of ironic to think that absent that
effect, it maybe that we would be heading into an Ice Age again. In fact, back in the 1970s, a lot of theorists were predicting
that, you know, the climate would start to cool and we’d slowly enter into the new Ice Age. And then they were puzzled as
to why it didn’t seem to be happening.
Umm... now, what are the implications for the future? Well, um... it is a little tricky. I mean, you could say, well, here is
an example of ... um ... human activity, the agricultural revolution which actually was beneficial, we altered the climate for
the better , perhaps, by preventing an Ice Age. But then industrialization, of course, has drastically increased the amount of
carbon dioxide that humans are putting into the atmosphere, the burning of fossil fuels tends to put a lot of CO2 into the
atmosphere. Um... so we are entering into uncharted territory now, in terms of the amount of carbon dioxide, the
concentrations of carbon dioxide that are now being put into the atmosphere as a result of industrialization and the use of
fossil fuels.
180TPO20 Section2 Conversation2-Student&Professor
Narrator
Listen to a conversation between a student and a professor .
Student
Professor Jennings, I hope I am not interrupting, but you wanted to see me?
Professor
Oh, hello, Suzane. Yes, yes, come right in. How are you doing?
Student
All right.
Professor
Well, good. The reason I wanted to talk to you was that while you were presenting you linguistics project in class the
other day, well, you know, I was thinking you are a perfect candidate for the dean’s undergraduate research fund.
Student
Um ... Professor , I am really sure what the... um ... dean ....
Professor
Undergraduate research fund is ... It is a mouthful I suppose. OK. Here’s the thing. Every year the school has a pool of
money to fund a number of research projects of undergraduate students. Because as you can imagine, indepth research often
requires monetary support.
Student
I would like to expand on my research.
Professor
Good. First a panel of professors reviews the applications for the grant. And then they decide which project should be
funded. The alloted money could be used for travel expenses, to attend a conference for example, or things like supplies,
research equipment, resources that are necessary to conduct the research.
Student I
see.
Professor
Right. And I think you should apply for this grant. Your project is definitely eligible
. And you can
expand it if you have the necessary resources. So, does it sound like something you would be interested in?
181Student
Oh, yeah, sounds great. I thought the topic I work on was very interesting, and it is certainly relevant to my linguistics
major . I assume it will also look good when I try to get into graduate school. But how do I apply for the grant?
Professor
It is pretty straightforward. A brief description of your proposed project, and an estimated budget. How much you need
to spend and what you intend to spend it on. Also a glowing letter of recommendation from a linguistics professor wouldn’t
hurt, which I’d be more than happy to write up for you.
Student
OK. Cool. I am pretty clear on how to carry out my project, but I am not sure where I can find more information on the
subject.
Professor
Well, I have already thought of that. There’s this private library at a university in Boston. By the way, because I
graduated from that school, I can get you access to it, no problem. You see, the library houses lots of unpublished
documents that are relevant to your topic.
Student
So I can put that on the application for the grant, that I plan on using material from that library for my research and
figure a trip to Boston into my budget?
Professor
Exactly. I really think judging from your work in class, and the relevance and clarity of this project, you really have a
good chance of getting the funding.
Student
OK. I’ll definitely apply then.
Professor
The sooner the better . It is due in a few weeks. Gook Luck! And I’ll get that letter written up right
away.
TPO20 Lecture3-Literature(Folktales)
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a literature class.
182Professor
All right, so now we’ve talked about folk legends and seen that their ... one of their key features is there’s usually some
real history behind them. They are often about real people, so you can identify with the characters, and that’s what engages
us in them. The particular stories might not be true and some of the characters or events might be made up. But there’s still a
sense that the story could have been true since it is about a real person. That’s distinct contrast from the other main branch
of popular storytelling, which is folk tales.
Folk tales are imaginative stories that ... um ... like folk legends, they have been passed down orally, from storyteller to
storyteller for ... since ancient times. But with folk tales you don’t ever really get the sense that the story might have been
true. They are purely imaginative and so quite revealing, I think anyway, about the culture and the connection between folk
tales and culture, which we’ll talk about.
But first let’s go over the various types of folk tale and focus specifically on Norwegian folk tales since they illustrate
the variety pretty well. There are in general three main types of Norwegian folk tales.
One is animal stories, where animals are the main characters. They can be wild animals or domestic, and a lot of times
they can talk and behave like humans, but at the same time, they retain their animal characteristics too. They tend to involve
animals like bears, wolves and foxes. The point of these stories, their, their internal objectives, so the speak, is usually to
explain some feature of the animal, how it arose. So there’s one about a fox who fools a bear into going ice fishing with his
tail. When the bear puts his tail into the water through a hole in the ice, to try and catch a fish, the ice freezes around it, and
he ends up pulling his tail off. So that’s why bears to this day have such short tails.
The second category of Norwegian folk tale is the supernatural. Eh ... stories about giants and dragons and trolls, and
humans with supernatural powers or gifts, like invisibility cloaks. Or where people are turned into animals and back again
into a person, those are called transformation stories.
There’s a well-known Norwegian supernatural folk tale, a transformation story called East of the Sun and West of the
Moon, which we’ll read. It involves a prince who is a white bear by night and a human by day. And he lives in the castle
that’s east of the Sun and west of the Moon, which the heroine in the story has to try to find. Besides being a good example
of a transformation story, this one also has a lot of the common things that tend to show up in folk tales. You will find the
standard opening, ‘once upon a time ... ’ . And it has stock characters like a prince, and a poor but beautiful peasant girl, she
is the heroine I mentioned. And ... um ... it has a very conventional form. So no more than two characters are involved in
any one scene. And it has a happy ending. And it’s ... the story is presented as though ... well, even though a lot of the
actions that occurred are pretty fantastic, so you’d never think of it as realistic. The characters still act like ... they resemble
real people. They are not real or even based on historical figures. But you might have a supernatural story involving a king,
and he’d act like you’d expect a Norwegian king to act.
OK. The third main kind of folk tale is the comical story. We’ll say more later about these, but for now, just be aware
of the category and that they can contain supernatural aspects, but they are usually more playful and amusing overall than
supernatural stories.
Now, as I said, traditionally, folk tales were just passed down orally. Each generation of storytellers had their own style
of telling a story. But ... um ... in Norway, before the 19th century, folk tales were just for kids. They weren’t seen as worthy
of analysis or academic attention. But this changed when the romantic movement spread throughout Europe in the mid-19th
century. Romantics looked at folk tales as sort of a reflection of the soul of the people. So there was something distinctly
Norwegian in folk tales from Norway. And there was renewed pride in the literature and art forms of individual countries.
As a result, the first collection of Norwegian folk tales is published in 1852. And there have been many new editions
published since then. For the people of Norway, these stories are now an important part of what it means to be Norwegian.
183TPO20 Lecture4-Biology(Snowshoe Hare)
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a biology class.
Professor
Now, James, you said you had been to the State of Maine, right?
Student
Yeah, actually I lived in western Maine until I was about sixteen.
Professor
Great. So why don’t you tell everybody what is like there in the winter?
Student
The winter? Well, it’s cold. And there’s lots of snow, you wouldn’t believe how much snow we
used to get.
Professor
Actually I would. I did field research up there a couple of winters. And it really is an incredible environment. And to
survive in that sort of environment, animals have to adapt, to evolve in response to their surroundings. As you recall, an
adaptation is any feature, um... physical or behavioral feature of a species that helps it survive and reproduce. And in
adapting to extreme climates, like Maine in the winter time, animals can evolve in pretty interesting ways. Take, for
example, the snowshoe hare.
Ok, the snowshoe hare, and of course, that’s H-A-R-E, like a rabbit. Although I probably should mention that
technically a hare is not exactly the same as a rabbit, even though it is very similar . The primary difference is that a rabbit’s
young are born blind and without fur , while a hare’s babies are born with a full coat and able to see.
Now, the snowshoe hare, tell me, what sort of adaptations do you think it has developed that help it survive the Maine
winters? I’ll give you a hint. Food isn’t an issue. The hare actually has abundant food in the small twigs it finds.
Student
Well, I don’t know. I mean, I know we used to try to look for these rabbits, eh... hares, when we went hiking in the
winter , but it was often hard to find them in the snow.
Professor
Yes. That’s exactly right. The major concern of the snowshoe hare in the winter is predators. And now that includes
humans. So one of its adaptations is basically camouflage. In other words, its coat, its fur , turns from brown in the summer
to white in the winter , which makes it harder for the hare’s predators to see it against the white snow.
Student
184Yeah, but I could swear I remembered seeing rabbits in the snow a couple of times, I means hares, that were brown.
Professor
Well, you may very well have. Timing is really important, but the snowshoe hare doesn’t always get it exactly right. Its
chances for survival are best if it turns white about the time of the first snowfall. And it’s the amount of daylight that
triggers the changing of the hare’s coat. As the days get shorter , that is, as the Sun is up for a shorter and shorter time each
day, the snowshoe hare starts growing white fur and shedding its brown fur . The hare does a pretty good job with its timing,
but sometimes when there’s a really early or late snow, it stands out. Plus, it takes about a month for the snowshoe hare’s
coat to completely change color . So if there’s a particularly early snowfall, it’s very likely that the hare’s fur would not yet
be totally white. And that would make this a particularly dangerous time for the hare.
OK. What else? Other adaptations? Susan?
Student
Well, it’s called the snowshoe hare, so are its feet somehow protect it from the cold?
Professor
Well, this animal’s name does have to do with an adaptation of its feet. Uh... though, not like it has warm furry boots or
something to keep its feet from getting cold. You’ve probably never needed to wear snowshoes. But, well, snowshoes are
not like thick furry shoes designed to keep the feet warm, they are actually quite thin, but very wide. What they do is spread
out the weight of the foot coming down on the snow. See, the problem with walking on snow is that you sink in with every
step. But with snowshoes, you don’t sink in, you walk on top of the snow. It makes walking through the Maine countryside
in the winter much easier .
Anyway, the snowshoe hare has an adaptation that plays on the same idea. It has hind feet that act like snowshoes. I
mean, it’s paws are wide and they allow the hare to hop and run just at the surface of deep snow. And this is a huge
advantage for the snowshoe hare since by contrast, the feet of its predators usually sink right down into the snow.
Now, another advantage related to this is that unlike many animals in winter, snowshoe hares can stay lean and light
weight. They accumulate essentially no body fat. Can anyone guess why this is so?
Student
They don’t eat very much?
Professor
Well, yes. But not because there isn’t enough food around. It’s because, like I said, food is almost always within reach,
and they don’t have to store up a lot of food energy for the harsh winters.
185TPO-21
Conversation1
Narrator
Listen to a conversation between a student and a professor.
Professor Excuse me, can I help you? You look a little lost.
Student Yeah, I am. This is my first day on campus, and I don’t know where anything is.
Professor Can’t find your orientation session?
Student Uh-huh. What a way to begin! Lost going to orientation
Professor Well, my guess is in the auditorium, that’s where they usually are.
Student You’re right, the general ones. I went to one of those sessions ealier today. But now I need the one for my
major, engineering. My schedule says the meeting room is in ... Johnson Hall? In the engineering department, which should
be right here in front of us, according to the map. But this building is called the Morgan Hall.
Professor Well, your map reading skills are fine actually. This used to be Johnson Hall, all right. Trouble is they
changed the name to Morgan Hall last spring. So they sent you a map with an old name? I am surprised.
Student Well, this was actually mailed out month and month ago. I got a second pack in the mail more recently with
another one of these maps in it. I guess they must have the updated name. I left that one in my dorm room.
Professor Well, things change fast around here. This building was renamed after one of our professors. She retired a
few months ago. She is very well-known in the world of physics. Too bad for Johnson, I guess.
Student Who is Johnson anyway?
Professor Oh, one of the early professors here. Unfortunately, I thinks his ideas are going out of style. Science kept
marching forward.
Student I’ll say it does. That’s why I transferred to this university. I was really impressed with all the research
equipment you guys have at the laboratories. You are really on the forefront.
Professor Um... so do you know what kind of engineering you want to specialize in?
Student Yeah, aerospace engineering.
Professor Well, the aerospace engineering department here is excellent! Eh... do you know that this university was the
first one in the country to offer a program in aerospace engineering?
Student Yeah, I know. And a couple of students who graduated from here became astronauts and orbited the Earth.
Professor Right. The department has many prominent alumni. Well, you might end up taking some of your advanced
186math course with me. I get a lot of students from the engineering department because I teach the required applied
mathematics courses.
Student Oh, cool. Actually, I want to get a minor in math.
Professor Excellent. Hmm... A major in aerospace engineering with a minor in math, you’ll go far with that degree.
More of our students should do that. There are so many more opportunities available in the field when you have a strong
math background.
Student I’m glad to hear you say that.
187TPO 21 Lecture 1 Astronomy(Geocentric&Heliocentric theory)
Narrator Listen to part of a lecture in a history of science class. Aristarchus-Heliocentric Theory
Professor Ok, we have been talking about how throughout history, it was often difficult for people to give up ideas
which have long been taken for granted as scientific truth, even if those ideas were false. In Astronomy, for example, the
distinction between the solar system and the universe wasn’t clear until modern times. The ancient Greeks believed that
what we called the solar system was in fact the entire universe, and that the universe was geocentric. Geocentric means
Earth-centered, so the geocentric view holds that the Sun, the planets, and the stars, all revolve around the Earth, which is
stationary. Of course, we now know that the planets, including Earth, revolve around the Sun, and that the solar system is
only a tiny part of the universe.
So, why did the ancient Greeks believe that the Earth was the center of the universe? Well, it made sense to them.
Observations of the sky make it appear as if the Sun, the moon, and the stars all revolve around the Earth everyday, while
the Earth itself stayed in one place. And this view is also supported by their philosophical and religious beliefs about the
origin and structure of the universe. It was presented in the works of well-known Greek philosophers as early as the fourth
century B.C.E., and the geocentric theory continue to prevail in Western thought for almost 2,000 years, until the 17th
century.
Now, what’s especially interesting is that when astronomical observations were made that seemed to be inconsistent
with the geocentric view, the ancient Greeks did not really consider alternative theories. It was so intuitive, so sensible that
the Earth was the center of the universe that astronomers found ways to explain those seemingly inconsistent phenomena
within the geocentric view.
For example, Greek astronomers made excellent, very accurate observations of the movements of the planets, but the
observations revealed a bit of a problem. The geocentric theory said, that the planets would move around the Earth in one
direction. However, astronomers noticed that at times, several planets seem to stop moving in one direction and start
moving backward in their orbits around the Earth, and they came up with a theory that these planets themselves moved in
smaller circles called epicycles as they travelled around the Earth. Here’s a picture of what they imagined. You see how this
188epicycle theory could account for the seemingly backward motion of the planet. Of course, today we know that this
appearance of backward motion is caused by the fact that Earth, as well as other planets, all move in their own orbits around
the Sun, and the relative movements of the planets with respect to each other can get quite complex.
However, there were a few astronomers in Greece and other places who didn’t agree with the geocentric view, for
example, a Greek astronomer who lived in the third century B.C.E. He proposed the theory that our planetary system might
be heliocentric, his name was Aristarchus. Heliocentric means Sun-centered, that the Earth revolves around the Sun.
Aristarchus recognized from his calculations that the Sun was much larger than the Earth and other planets. It was probably
this discovery that led him to conclude that the universe is heliocentric. I mean, isn’t it more sensible to think that a smaller
heavenly body would orbit a larger one, rather than the opposite?
However, his proposition was rejected largely based on other scientific beliefs held at the time, which all made sense in
a way even if they were incorrect. Let me mention two objections Greeks made to Aristarchus’s theory. First, they believe
that everything that moves creates its own wind, so to speak, everyone has this experience when you are running, right? So,
they thought that if the Earth itself was moving, there would have to be a constant wind blowing, sweeping them off their
feet, and of course there wasn’t. And second, the idea of an Earth that moved didn’t fit in with the ancient Greeks’
understanding of gravity. They thought that gravity was basically a natural tendency of all things to move towards the center
of the universe, which was the Earth, or the center of the Earth, so that explains why apples and other falling objects were
falling straight down. If the Sun was at the center of the universe, things would fall toward the Sun and away from the Earth,
which of course they didn’t. So these were some of the reasons they rejected the heliocentric theory.
189TPO21 Lecture 2 Computer Science(Software Development)
Narrator Listen to part of a lecture in a Computer Science class. The professor is discussing software engineering.
Professor We’ve been talking about the software development cycle, and today I’d like to move on to the next stage of
that cycle-testing, and why finding bugs during testing is actually a great thing. Eh...eh... the quality of the software product
often relies heavily on how well it’s been tested. Liz?
Student Um... just a quick thing. Bugs is the word for problems in the program code, right?
Professor
Yeah, in code or in a computer itself. There is a bit of a story behind that term. Um... back in the 1940s, when the
computer industry was just starting, a group of computer scientists was working late one night, and there was a problem in
one of the computers’ circuits1. When they examined it, they found a five-centimeter long moth caught in there. Once they
debugged the computer, it worked just fine. And ever since then, all kinds of computer problems have been known as bugs.
Anyway, you want to find bugs while the software is still in the development and testing phases. Finding them when
the software product has already been put on the market can be quite embarrassing. Generally speaking, every software
development project has a group of testers and a group of developers. Jack?
Student And they are different people?
Professor They are generally completely different group of people. My personal opinion is that they have to be
different groups of people because developers often have a bias for their own work, and it blinds them to certain problems
that might be obvious to somebody else. So it is always good to have a different set of eyes to go in there and make sure that
everything is tested properly.
Ok, now, here’s the key. Developers and testers have different mentalities. The mentality of the software developer is
construtive, creative, they are spending long hours working together to create and build something new. A software tester,
on the other hand, their entire goal is to look at this product and find problems with it, to improve it. Now, this difference
between the testers and the developers can lead to an environment where there is a bit of friction. And that friction
sometimes makes it difficult for the two teams to work together.
There are two projects that I worked on a couple of years ago. One, which I’ll call Project Split, well, the testing and
development teams did not work well together. And the other, I’ll call Project Unity, during which both teams worked very
well together. Now, during Project Split, we had defect meetings where the developers and the testers met together, eh... eh...
to discuss various problems and how they should be fixed. And you could sense the conflict just by walking into the room.
Literally, the testers and the developers sat on opposite sides on the table. Um... and ... and the developers were very
defensive about the feedback.
Student Well, if bugs are being pointed out they wouldn’t be too happy since its their work.
Professor Exactly. Now, ‘cause the two teams weren’t working well together, the fixes were coming very very slowly.
And you know, a lot of times when you fix bugs you introduce new bugs, or you discover bugs and other areas that only
come to light because something has been changed, so fixing all those new additional bugs was also being delayed. Um...
the test process went on much longer than expected and we ended up having to put the product on the market with known
bugs in it, which was obviously not ideal.
190Student Ok, and what about Project Unity? How was it different?
Professor
Um... this was different because two teams worked closely together during the defect meetings, instead of put up walls.
Um... we didn’t even talked about, you know, who should fix this, who is at fault2. We all acknowledge what needed to be
fixed. So if we had ten bugs, we said, ‘Hey, you know what? Let’s do this one first ‘cause this would expose another whole
bunch of defects that we haven’t even seen yet.’ So we were being proactive3 and effective. And because we were so much
more effective with our time, we were actually able to do more than just fix the bugs, we even put in some improvements
that we hadn’t planned.
191TPO21 Conversation 2
Narrator Listen to a conversation between a student and her public relations professor.
Student Hi, professor Gordin. I really learned a lot from your lecture, the one about analyzing all those different
segments of the population. Oh, the official term is audience, right? I never imagine that one company could have over
thirty audiences to communicate with.
Professor Yeah, a lot of students are taken aback by this, and some public relations consultants don’t figure it out until
they’ve worked in the field a while.
Student Everyone thinks, public relations, eh, PR is easy, but there’s a lot to it. You really got to know what you are
doing.
Professor Absolutely. So, Stacy, your email implied that you needed my advice about graduate school?
Student No, since my undergraduate degree will be in public relations, I’ve already decided to get a master’s degree in
marketing. Sorry, I wasn’t clear. My issue is, I have got two require courses and two electives. I am trying to figure out
which elective course is to take. My advisor suggested economics and accounting, but I am not really sure.
Professor About?
Student Well, I endured accounting and economics in high school and barely stayed awake, they were so ...
Professor Ok, Ok. I hear you. Eh... you say you wanted a master’s in marketing, you have got one more semester till
graduation. Have you taken any marketing courses yet?
Student No, I figured I’ve got the marketing basis already since I have take every PR in communication courses offered
here.
Professor Well, there’s some overlap between PR and marketing, but there are important differences too. Marketing
focuses on selling your product or service, eh, you know, attracting customers through advertising, and also buiding
relationships with customers. That’s what a marketing department does. PR is all about, it involves relationships too, that’s
why I am saying the two fields overlap. But in PR, you are developing relationships with a wider range of audience.
Student Right. Like employees, suppliers, the media. I do understand this in theory, but aren’t you still selling your
product, just in a different way?
Professor Not necessarily. Ok, do you remember that PR strategy I alluded to the other day? The one our university
uses, a strategy that doesn’t overlap its marketing strategy?
Student You mean how the university invites local residents to attend certain lectures and classes for free?
Professor Yeah, this cultivates a sense of good will and helps the university avoid becoming isolated from the larger
community. Bringing neighbours into our classrooms is good PR, but it is not marketing since our neighbours aren’t our
customers, for the most part.
Student That’s why I want to focus on marketing in graduate school. Wouldn’t having expertise in PR and marketing
192giving me more career options?
Professor Yeah, but you’ll also want to enjoy your work. So for you electives, why don’t you take advertising
principles and intro to marketing, which I teach. This way, you’ll find out if marketing is something you really want to
pursue. Graduate School tuition is expensive, and these courses will give you a good overview of the field before
committing yourself.
Student I wish my advisor had suggested those courses.
Professor Well, I am someone who has worked in both marketing and PR, so I can offer a different perspective than
someone who only teaches ...
193TPO21 Lecture3 Biology(Snake Evolution)
Narrator Listen to part of a lecture in a biology class.
Professor Probably back in some previous biology course you learned that snakes evolved from lizards, and that the
first snakes weren’t venomous and then along came more advanced snakes, the venomous snakes. Ok, venomous snakes are
the ones that secrete poisonous substances or venom, like the snakes of the viper family or cobras. Then there is
non-venomous snakes like constrictors and pythons. Another family of snakes, the colubrids, don’t really fit neatly into
either category though. Colubrids, and you probably learned this too, although they are often classified as venomous snakes,
they are actually generally non-venomous. They are classified as venomous snakes because they resemble them, their
advanced features more than the other non-venomous snakes.
Now, what if I told you that there is a good chance that most everything I just said is wrong? Well, everything except
the part about snakes evolving from lizards. See, the basic theory about snake evolution has been challenged by a recent
study that revealed a whole new understanding of evolutionary relationship for reptiles, you know, which reptiles descended
from which ancestors. The researchers study the proteins in the venom genes of various species of colubrids. Emm... snake
venom is a mixture of proteins, some toxic, poisonous, and some not. By analyzing the DNA, the genetic material of the
proteins, the researchers could focus on the toxic genes and use them to trace the evolution of snake venom, and from this,
the evolution of snakes.
Traditionally, to understanding evolutionary relationships, we looked at various easily observed physical characteristics
of animals, their skeleton, the size of their brain, and... and then classify them based on similarities and differences. The
problem with this method is that characteristics that appear similar may actually have developed in quite different ways. For
example, some venoms are chemical-based, and others are bacteria-based, so they clearly had to have developed along
different routes and may not be as closely related as we thought.
Now, and not everyone will agree about this. The classification based on DNA seems to be much more reliable. Ok,
back to the research. The researchers found that venom evolved before snakes even existed, about a hundred million years
before. Now, a couple of venomous lizards were included in this study. And the researchers found some of the same DNA in
their venom as in the snakes’ venom. This suggested that the common ancestor of all snakes was actually venomous lizard,
which means that actually, according to this research, anyway, in terms of the snakes’ ancestry, there is no such thing as a
non-venomous snake, not even colubrids. What separates colubrids from other snakes we have been classifying is
venomous, is not the lack of venom, but the lack of an effective way to deliver the venom into its prey. In most venomous
snakes, like vipers and cobras, the venom is used to catch and inmoblize the prey; but in colubrids, venom drips onto the
prey only after the prey is in the snake’s mouth. So for colubrids, the venom must serve some other purpose, maybe linked
to digesting prey. As the different families of venomous snakes evolved, the teeth moved forward, becoming larger, and the
venom becoming stronger, so the evolution of the obvious venomous snakes, like cobras and vipers, is about the evolution
of an efficient delivery system, not so much the evolution of the venom itself.
So, if there are no truly non-venomous snakes, were the so-called non-venomous snakes, like constrictors and pythons,
were they venomous at some point in their evolution? Well, that’s not clear at this point. Constrictors have evolved to kill
their prey by crushing, but perhaps they once were venomous, and then at some point their venom-producing apparatus4
wasn’t needed anymore, so it gradually disappeared. There’s one species of snake, the brown tree snake, that uses both
constriction and venom, depending on its prey. So, well, it is possible.
So, we have these new concepts of snakes’ evolution and a new DNA database, all these information on the genetic
makeup of snake venom. And what we have learned from this has led researchers to believe that venom proteins may have
some exciting applications in the field of medical research. You see, venom alters biological functions in the same way
194certain drugs do, and the big benefit of drugs made from snakes venom would be that they target only certain cells, so
maybe that’ll create fewer side effects. Now, it sounds far-fetched5, venom is the basis for human drugs. So far, only one
protein has been targeted for study as a potential drug, but who knows, maybe someday.
195TPO21 Lecture 4 Art History(Alice Neel)
Narrator Listen to part of a lecture in an Art History class.
Professor
All right, so today we are moving on to Alice Neel, N-E-E-L. Um... Alice Neel painted portraits, she was born in
Pennsylvania, and she lived from 1900 to 1984. And I guess you might say, she experienced difficulties as an artist. She
was in her 70s, before she had her first major solo exhibition. Um, and this is due at least in part to eh... or... because of
photography. After photography became regarded as an art form, portrait painting became less prestigious6, less respected
as an art form. And, well, art photography kind of took its place, so you can imagine that a portrait artist, would have had a
hard time finding acceptance.
Eh, but the real reason I want to look at Neel, is that I really find her style ... eh, she had interesting ways of portraying
people. She combined some elements of realism. What’s realism, Alison?
Student It’s like painting something exactly how it is, so an artist would try to make it as accurate, um... and objective
as possible. Painting stuff just how it appears on the surface.
Professor Ok, good. So Neel combined realism with, well, actually, with expressionism. And that is? We, we just
covered this.
Student Um... It’s into emotion, like artists are trying to, well, express themselves through the painting, right?
Professor
Yep. The artist is depicting subjective emotions, showing the inner reality as interpreted by the artist rather than the
outward form. So the image itself might be distorted or exaggerated in some way. The expression overrides7 objective
representation. Ok, so, Alice Neel combined these two styles ... Yes?
Student Em... How is that even possible? How can your portray something exactly as it is and at the same time distort
it with emotions? I don’t get it.
Professor
All right, good question. It is actually a good lead-in8 to some of the techniques that Neel used, that she employed to
bridge that contradiction. In a minute, I’ll show you some of her portraits, and I’ll want you to notice a few things about
them.
First, Neel’s use of bold color. All right? You’ll see she uses color to convey emtion and feeling, like the subjects’
clothing for instance, it appears brighter than it really is. And the subjects, the people being portrayed, Neel paid special
attention to faces. The way she paints the eyes and how the faces are portrayed, these are quite realistic, like the realists’ work. But another thing Neel did was use elongated, sort of stretchy figures.
Student But didn’t a lot of expressionist painters do that? So really your are saying that Neel’s techniques were similar
to what other artists were doing. What was it that she did, that was like all her own?
Professor Ok, well, I think it has to do partly with the way she combined these techniques. So, for example, those
realistic faces and eyes, but bright, distorted figures. It is a mix. You’ll see that her portraits do reflect reality, the people that
were actually sitting there. Realism was important in the sense that she wanted to show people as they really were, much
like a photographer would. But Neel wasn’t satisfied with photo-like realism, she went beyond that. And this is where
196expressionism comes in.
She believed in capturing the whole person, not just what was on the surface, that’s where the expressionists’ distortion
is important, in an attempt to reveal the subjects’ character or personality.
But Neel’s paintings are distinctive for her time in part because they are portraits. Remember I said that photography
and art photography had largely taken the place of portraiture, to the extent that some critics had declared the genre of
portraiture to be dead. But Neel felt that painting should reflect reality, a real realist’s stance9 you could say. And to her,
individuals, people best reflect the reality of their time, of the age that they lived in, so she painted portraits. And if you look
at her work, we are talking in the vicinity of10 three thousand paintings. If your looked at them, it is like this gallery of the
whole century, an enomous range of subjects: families, women, children, artists, people in poverty--these paintings really
span class, age and gender. It is like she transformed the genre, it is not just formal depictions of presidents and ancestors
any more.
But keep in mind that she was doing this when abstract art dominated the art scene. Representations of people weren’t
fashionable in the art world. And it wasn’t until fairly late in the century that critics recognized the power of what she did.
TPO 22
Conversation 1 (Faculty Advisor)
Narrator: Listen to a conversation between a student and a faculty advisor for the university newspaper.
Student: Hi, I am sorry to bother you, but…
Faculty advisor: Yes?
Student: This is about the newspaper.
Faculty Advisor: Oh, Ok. Well. I am only the advisor; the newspaper office is off campus on Pine Street. Eh…what
was it? Did you want to work for the paper? We are always looking for writers.
Student: Well, my problem was with the writing actually, with an article that was published in yesterday’s newspaper.
Faculty Advisor: Oh? Which one?
Student: The one about the student government and its president Sally Smith.
Faculty Advisor: Is this something to do with what the editor wrote about the statue? Eh, the statue at the main entrance
of the university?
Student: Well, that’s part of it. But you know, the editor used the situation to say some really unfair things, about the
student government, and the president Sally Smith in particular. I think the paper should publish a retraction, or at the very
least an apology to Sally.
Faculty Advisor: Ok. Um… if I remember correctly, what you are referring to wasn’t a news story, but an editorial,
right? Eh, it was on the opinion page, it was signed by one of the editors, and was clearly labeled as commentary.
197Student: Well, yes. But the thing about the statue, Sally made this simple comment that was in really bad condition and
should be replaced. And, well, the tone in the editorial was demeaning. It accused her of not respecting the past and it had
some personal stuff that seemed unnecessary.
Faculty Advisor: Wait a minute. Remind me.
Student: Well, you know, it implied that Sally doesn’t know much about the university’s history and it called her a big
city politician because she’s from Boston. It’s just mean-spirited, isn’t it?
Faculty Advisor: Haven’t you heard the saying “all publicity is good publicity”?
Student: Well…
Faculty Advisor: I’d say the article is bringing attention to the student government organization, which is pretty
invisible. Eh, you rarely hear about what the student government is doing.
Student: But this article…
Faculty Advisor: And the piece, well, yeah, it had a bit of an exaggerated tone. It was satirical, or at least it was meant
to be. It wasn’t just poking fun at Sally, but the whole idea that our school is sort of rural, and you know, not cosmopolitan.
Student: Well, none of us thought it was very funny.
Faculty Advisor: Well, sometimes it’s best just to roll with it. It is just a cliché; everybody knows it is not true.
Student: But I thought we could expect better than that here.
Faculty Advisor: Well, I am certainly in favor of getting a variety of viewpoints. [so why don’t you go talk to the editor,
Jennifer Hamilton, and tell her you want equal time? You or Sally could write a response.]
Student: [Really? She would let us do that? ] Didn’t she write it?
Faculty Advisor: I’ll let Jennifer know you are coming, she feels the same way I do. She is journalism major. She
would be happy to publish another point of view.
TPO22 Lecture 1 (Anthropology)
Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an anthropology class.
Professor: One of the big questions when we look at prehistory is why did the earliest states form?
Well, to begin we’d better define exactly what we mean when we talk about states. The human groups that are the smallest
and have the least social and political complexity, we call bands. The groups that are the largest and most socially and
politically complex, we call states. So, the level of complexity here refers to the organization of people into large, diverse
groups, and densely populated communities. And there are four levels in total: bands, tribes, chiefdoms and states.
But, but back to my original question. Why did early states form? Why not just continue to live in small groups? Why
become more complex?
198One theory called the environmental approach hypothesizes that the main force behind state formation was population
growth. It assumes that centralized management was critical to dealing with issues caused by sudden population surges, like
a strain on limited food supplies.
At the least complex end of the spectrum, the few families living in bands are able to meet their own basic needs. They
usually hunt together and forage whatever foods are available to them, instead of domesticating animals and planting crops.
In order to efficiently take advantage of the wild foods available, bands are often nomadic and move around following herds
of animals. This strategy is feasible when you have a small population.
But when you have a large population, well, the whole population can’t just get up and move to follow a wild herd of
animals. So you need sophisticated technologies to produce enough food for everyone. And there is an increase need to
resolve social problems that arise as people begin to compete for resources. To manage intensified food production, to
collect, store and distribute food, you need centralized decision-making, centralized decision-makers.
It’s the same thing when it comes to maintaining social order. You need to create and efficiently enforce a formal legal
code. It makes sense to have a centralized authority in charge of that, right? So a hierarchy forms. By definition, states had
at least three social levels. Usually, an upper class of rulers, a middleclass comprised of managers and merchants, and a
lower class of crop producers and agricultural laborers.
The environmental approach hypothesizes that states appear in certain environmental settings, settings which have a
severe population problem or a shortage of agricultural land. But not everyone agrees with the theory. It definitely has some
weaknesses. For example, states have developed in places like the mild lowlands of Mesoamerica and in Egypt’s Nile River
Valley. Both places had vast areas of fertile farmland, no shortage of agricultural land. And what about population increase?
Well, there were some early states that formed where there wasn’t any sudden population increase. So it seems that these are
valid criticisms of the environmental approach.
TPO22 Lecture 2 (Astronomy)
Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an astronomy class.
Professor: Today, I want to talk about a paradox the ties in with the topic we discuss last time. We were discussing the
geological evidence of water, liquid water on Earth and Mars three to four billion years ago. So, what evidence of a liquid
water environment did we find in rock samples taking from the oldest rocks on Earth?
Student: Eh… Like pebbles, fossilized algae?
Professor: Right. And on Mars?
Student: Dry channels?
Professor: Good. All evidence of water in liquid form, large quantities of it. Now, remember when we talked about star
formation, we said that as a star ages, it becomes brighter, right? Hydrogen turns into Helium, which releases energy. So our
standard model of star formation suggests that the Sun wasn’t nearly as bright three to four billion years ago as it is today, which means the temperatures on Earth and Mars would have been lower, which in turn suggests…
Student: There would have been ice on Earth or Mars?
199Professor: Correct. If the young Sun was much fainter and cooler than the Sun today, liquid water couldn’t have existed
on either planet.
Now, this apparent contradiction between geologic evidence and the stellar evolution model became known as the faint
young Sun paradox.
Now, there have been several attempts to solve this paradox.
First, there was the greenhouse-gas solution. Well, you are probably familiar with the greenhouse gas effect, so I won’t
go into details now. The idea was that trapped greenhouse gases in the atmospheres of Earth and Mars might have caused
temperatures to raise enough to compensate for the low heat the young Sun provided. And so it would have been warm
enough on these planets for liquid water to exist. So, what gas do you think was the first suspect in causing the greenhouse
effect?
Student: Um…carbon dioxide, I guess. Like today?
Professor: In fact, studies indicate that four billion years ago, carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere were much
higher than today’s levels. But the studies also indicate that they weren’t high enough to do the job—make up for a faint
Sun.
Then some astronomers came up with the idea that atmospheric ammonia might have acted as a greenhouse gas. But
ammonia would have been destroyed by the ultra-violet light coming from the Sun and it had to be ruled out too.
Another solution, which is proposed much later, was that perhaps the young Sun wasn’t faint at all, perhaps it was
bright. So it is called the bright-young-Sun solution, according to which the Sun would have provided enough heat for the
water on Earth and Mars to be liquid. But how could the early Sun be brighter and hotter than predicted by the standard
model? Well, the answer is mass.
Student: You mean the Sun had more mass when it was young?
Professor: Well, if the young Sun was more massive than today’s, it would have been hotter and brighter than the
model predicts. But this would mean that it had lost mass over the course of four billion years.
Student: Is that possible?
Professor: Actually, the Sun is constantly losing mass through the solar wind, a stream of charged particles constantly
blowing off the Sun. we know the Sun’s current rate of mass loss, but if we assume that this rate has been steady over the
last four billion years, the young Sun wouldn’t have been massive enough to have warmed Earth, let alone Mars, not enough
to have caused liquid water.
Student: Maybe the solar wind was stronger then?
Professor: There is evidence that the solar wind was more intense in the past. But we don’t know for sure how much
mass our Sun’s lost over the last four billion years. Astronomers tried to estimate what solar mass could produce the
required luminosity to explain liquid water on these planets. They also took into account that with a more massive young
Sun, the planets would be closer to the Sun than they are today. And they found that about seven percent more mass would
be required.
200Student: So the young Sun had seven percent more mass than our Sun?
Professor: Well, we don’t know. According to observations of young Sun like stars, our Sun may have lost as much as
six percent of its initial mass, which doesn’t quite make it. On the other hand, this estimate is based on a small sample. And
the bright-young-Sun solution is appealing. We simply need more data to determine the mass loss rate of stars. So there’s
reason to believe that we will get an answer to that piece of the puzzle one day.
TPO22 Conversation 2 (Professor)
Narrator: Listen to part of a conversation between a student and his music history professor.
Student: So, I was wondering what I could do to improve my paper before the final draft is due.
Professor: Well, Michael, I have no problem with your writing style. It’s graceful and clear. Eh, and it’s interesting that
you are writing about your grandmother’s piano concert.
Student: Yeah, when you said we had to attend a concert and write about it, I immediately thought of her. I have been
to lots of her concerts. So I am really familiar with her music.
Professor: That’s not necessarily an advantage. Familiarity sometimes makes it hard to see things objectively.
Student: So I shouldn’t write about my grandmother?
Professor: No, no, no. I am just talking in general. But as I mentioned in my comments, I’d like you to place your
grandmother’s concert in… in a broader context.
Student: Yeah, I saw that, but I wasn’t sure what you meant. I mean, I mentioned my grandmother’s childhood, how
much her parents love music, how she played the piano at all our family gatherings.
Professor: Ok. I see what happened now. By broader context, I mean how the concert relates to some period in music
history.
Student: I see. Ok. Um… I have an idea.
Professor: Ok.
Student: Well, as you read in my paper, my grandmother performs classical music.
Professor: Yes.
Student: That’s her true love. But for most of her career, she performed jazz. She originally studied to be a classical
pianist. But jazz was in its heyday back then, and when she got out of the conservatory, she was invited to join a jazz
orchestra. And the opportunity was just too good to turn down.
Professor: Really. Well, that’s fascinating. Because she probably had to reinvent her whole musical style.
Student: She did. But jazz was where the money was at that time, at least for her.
Professor: But she eventually went back to classical?
201Student: Right. But only recently.
Professor: Ok.
Student: So if I can show how her choices relate to what was happening in the world of music at the time…?
Professor: I think that might work very nicely.
Student: And if I do that, I guess I’ll have to like, interview her.
Professor: Right.
Student: And I guess that would mean…
Professor: You’ll have to rewrite most of your paper.
Student: Ouch!
Professor: Yeah. Would an extra week ease the pain?
Student: Definitely.
Professor: Ok. So are there other musicians in your family?
Student: Yeah. My mother plays piano, too. Not as well as my grandmother, but…
Professor: And you?
Student: I don’t play any instruments, but I sing in the university choir. In fact, we are performing next week, and I
have a solo.
Professor: That’s great! Could I tell the class about your concert?
Student: Um…sure. But…about my paper… what question should I be asking my grandmother?
Professor: You know what, I have a meeting now. Why don’t you come to class a few minutes early tomorrow?
Student: Will do.
TPO22 Lecture 3 (Zoology)
Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a zoology class.
Professor: A mass extinction as when numerous species become extinct over a very short time period, short,
geologically speaking that is, like when the dinosaurs died out 65 million years ago. And the fossil record, it indicates that in
all the time that animals have inhabited Earth, there have been five great mass extinctions, dinosaurs being the most recent.
In each of the others up to half of all land animals and up to 95 percent of marine species disappeared.
Well, today we are witnessing a sixth mass extinction, but unlike the others, the current loss of bio-diversity can be
traced to human to human activity. Since the Stone Age, humans have been eliminating species and altering ecosystems
202with astounding speed. Countless species have disappeared due to over-hunting, habitat destruction and habitat
fragmentation, pollution and other unnatural human causes.
So, as a way of repairing some of that damage, a group of conservation biologists has proposed an ambitious, or some
might say, a radical plan, involving large vertebrates, or , megafauna. Megafauna include elephants, wild horses, big cats,
camels, large animals. Eh, actually, the proposal focuses on a particular subset of megafauna, the kind that lived during the
Pleistocene epoch.
Ok. The Pleistocene epoch, most commonly known as the Ice Age, stretched from 1.8 million to 11,500 years ago. In
the Americas, many megafauna began disappearing by the end of the Pleistocene.
So here’s the biologists’ idea. Take a select group of animals, megafauna from places like Africa and Asia, and
introduce them into other ecosystems similar to their current homes, beginning in the United States. They call their plan
Pleistocene rewilding.
Now, the advocates of Pleistocene rewilding cite two main goals. One is to help prevent the extinction of some
endangered megafauna by providing new refuges, new habitats for them. The other is to restore some of the evolutionary
and ecological potential that has been lost in North America. What do I mean by restore evolutionary potential? Well as you
know the evolution of any species is largely influenced by its interactions with other species.
So during the Pleistocene epoch… let’s take the now extinct American cheetah, for instance. We believe it played a pivotal
role in the evolution of the pronghorn antelope, the antelope’s amazing speed, to be exact, because natural selection would
favor those antelope that could outrun a cheetah. When the American cheetahs disappeared, their influence on the evolution
of pronghorn and presumably on other prey animals stopped. So it is conceivable that the pronghorn antelope would have
continued to evolve, get faster maybe, if the cheetahs were still around. That’s what’s meant by evolutionary potential.
Importing African cheetahs to the western United States could, in theory, put the pronghorn back onto its… uh, natural
evolutionary trajectory according to these biologists.
Another example is the interaction of megafauna with local flora, in particular, plants that rely on animals to disperse their
seeds. Like Pleistocene rewilding could spark the re-emergence of large seeded American plants, such as the maclura tree.
Many types of maclura used to grow in North American, buy today, just one variety remains and it is found in only two
states. In the distant past, large herbivores like mastodons dispersed maclura seeds, each the size of an orange in their
droppings. Well, there aren’t any mastodons left, but there are elephants, which descended from mastodons. Introduce
elephants into that ecosystem and they might disperse those large maclura seeds, like their ancestors did.
Get the idea? Restoring some of the former balance to the ecosystem? But as I alluded to earlier, Pleistocene rewilding
is extremely controversial. A big worry is that these transplanted megafauna might devastate plants and animals that are
native to the western United States. In the years since the Pleistocene epoch, native species have adapted to the changing
environmental there, plants, smaller animals, they have been evolving without megafauna for millennia. Also, animal
species that went extinct 11,000 years ago, uh, some are quite different genetically from their modern-day counterparts, like
elephants don’t have thick coasts like their mastodon ancestors do when they graze the prairies of the America West during
the Ice Age. Granted, the climate today is not as cold as it was in the Pleistocene. But winters on the prairie can still get
pretty harsh today. And there are many more considerations. Well, you see how complex this is. If you think about it though,
the core problem with this sixth mass extinction is human interference. Pleistocene rewilding is based on good intentions,
but you know, it probably would just be more of the same thing.
203TPO22 Lecture 4 (Music History)
Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a music history class.
Professor: So, uh, if you are a musician in the United States in the early twentieth century, where could you work?
Student: Same as now, I suppose. In an orchestra, mainly.
Professor: Ok. And where would the orchestra be playing?
Student: Uh, in a concert hall or a dance hall?
Professor: That’s right. And smaller groups of musicians were needed in theaters as accompaniment to visual
entertainment, like cabarets and variety shows. But the largest employer for musicians back then was the film industry,
especially during the silent-film era.
Student: Really? You mean being a piano player or something? I thought movie theaters would have used recorded
music.
Professor: Well, no. Not during the silent-film era. We are talking a period of maybe thirty years where working in
movie theaters was the best job for musicians. It was very well-paid. The rapid growth of the film industry meant movie
theaters were popping up everywhere. So suddenly there was this huge demand for musicians. In fact, over 20,000 jobs for
musicians were gone, disappeared at the end of the silent-film era, 20,000. Ok. So from the beginning, music was a big part
of film, even at the first…
Student: Excuse me, professor. I think I read somewhere that they used music to drown out the sound of the film
projectors?
Professor: Yeah. That’s good story, isn’t it? Too bad it keeps getting printed as if it were the only reason music was
used. Well, think about it. Even if that were the case, noisy projectors were separated from the main house pretty quickly,
yet music continued to accompany film. So, as I was saying, even the very first public projection of a film had piano
accompaniment. So music was pretty much always there.
What’s strange to me though, is that at first film music didn’t necessarily correspond to what was on the screen. You
know, eh, a fast number for a chase, deep bass notes for danger, something light and humorous for comedy. And that’s
instantly recognizable now, even expected. But in the very early days of film, any music was played. A theater owner would
just buy a pile of sheet music and musicians will play it, no matter what it was. Pretty quickly though, thankfully, everybody
realized the music should suit the film. So eventually, film makers tried to get more control over the musical
accompaniment of their films., and specify what type of music to use and how fast or slow to play it.
Student: Are you saying there was no music written specifically for a particular movie?
Professor: Yeah. Original scores weren’t common then. Rarely a filmmaker might send along an original score
composed especially for a film, but usually a compilation of music that already existed would be used. Yeah, that was a
good time for a lot of musicians. But that all changed with the introduction of sound on film technology. Actually, even
204before that, organs could mimic a number of instruments and also do some sound effects. So they were starting to replace
live orchestras in some movie theaters, and it only takes one person to play an organ.
Student: Ok. But even after that someone still had to play the music for the sound for the sound recordings, the
soundtracks.
Professor: Yeah. But think of all the movie theaters there were, most employing about six to eight musicians, some
even had full orchestras. But in the early 1930s, most theater owners installed new sound systems. So suddenly a lot of
musicians were looking for work. Once recording technology took off, studio jobs working exclusively for one film
company, eh, studio jobs did become available. But the thing is, each major movie company pretty much had only one
orchestra for all their productions, a set number of regular musicians. So if you could get it, studio musician was a good job.
If you were cut out for it, musicians had to be able to read music very well, since the producers were very conscious of how
much money they were spending. They didn’t want to waste any time. So a musician was expected to play complicated
pieces of music pretty much without any preparation. If one couldn’t do it, there were plenty of others waiting to try. So
there was a lot of pressure to do well.

CONVERSATION 1
Narrator: Listen to a conversation between a student and the director of campus activities.
Student: I'm here 'cause... well, there's something I don't understand. I set an announcement for an event. And this
morning I checked the events section of the university's website. And nothing, there is no mention of it.
Director: And when did you summit this request?
Student: Last Wednesday. I followed the instructions very carefully. I am sure it was Wednesday, because know
announcements have be submitted three business days ahead of the posting day.
Director: And what's it for?
Student: A reading.
Director: A reading?
Student: Yes. A poetry reading.
Director: Oh, OK. When is it?
Student: In three days. It is an author from France we have been trying to get for a while. And now that he has finally
agreed to come, no one will be there.
Director: Wow. This person is really coming all the way from France?
Student: Oh, no. He is teaching promising there will be in New York City this year. We were able to sell him on a nice
size crowd , felt confident about that. Because the idea by I know how enthusiastic our group is.
Director: And your group ? do you have a name?
Student: Um ? it is kind of a loose group, you know, just a bunch of students in the French department who are
interested in French literature. There's no formal structure or anything. I guess you could call us the French Literature
Reading Group.
Director: OK. And it is a recognized group? By the university, I mean.
Student: No
Director: OK.
205Student: But the French Department is funding this, on the condition that we do all the legwork.
Director: All right. Hold on a second while I check. Well, it looks like we did receive your announcement last
Wednesday. Uh, looks like the editors must have decided not to include your event in this week's listings.
Student: Not included? Why?
Director: Well, we don't post things automatically. We get so many requests that we couldn't possibly post them all. So
events that are thought to be too specialized, without the potential for really wide appeal...
Student: Wow, I got to say that does surprise me. What am I going to do now? I mean, he really is quite famous. I
really do think there would be a genuine interest beyond my group. It would be a shame if no one shows up because there
isn't enough publicity. Is there anyone else I can talk to?
Director: I don't think that would do you much good since we are already working on next week's schedule. But maybe
you could ask the French department to post the announcement on its website. And maybe you could approach some other
departments as well, you know, relevant ones.
Student: I knew we should have done a poster. But everybody was like, oh, you can just post it online. In any event,
thanks for you help. It's something to consider.
TPO23 Lecture l- Archaeology (Antikythera (Mechanism)
Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an archaeology class.
Professor: I was talking to one of my colleagues in the physics department the other day, and we ended up discussing
how one discovery can change everything. My colleague mentioned how the theory of relativity completely changed the
field of physics. At any rates, that conversation got me thinking about archaeological finds that really changed our
understanding of ancient civilizations. So I want to talk about the discovery of the Antikythera Mechanism.
The Antikythera Mechanism was found a hundred years ago, under water in an ancient Greek shipwreck in the
Mediterranean Sea. It was in extremely poor condition and in many corroded pieces. But once we figured out what it was
and reconstructed it. Well, I simply don't have the words to convey how extraordinary this find was.
The Antikythera Mechanism is a relatively small device, roughly the size of a shoebox, made of gears fitted inside a
wooden case. In its original state, there were rotating dials and other indicators on the top, with letters and drawings
showing the Sun, the phases of the moon and different constellations. Inside the box, bronze gears would have rotated the
displays. The displays, uh, the indicators of the Antikythera Mechanism, would then moved to show the motion of the Sun
and moon relative to the planets and stars. The device could be used to tell the different phases of the moon and much more.
Well, scientists have recently analyzed the inscriptions on the mechanism and re-examine the other cargo in the ship
wreck, and the evidence makes an absolute case that this device dates back to ancient Greece somewhere between 150 and
100 B.C.E. What makes that so fascinating is that before we found the Antikythera Mechanism, the earliest device we had
that could track the Sun and moon like this was invented over 1,000 years later. So when this was first found, people
literally would not believe it. Some of my colleagues insisted it had to have been made well after 100 B.C.E. But this
physical evidence was conclusive. It was that old.
Of course part of what made this find so unusual is that the Antikythera Mechanism is constructed of bronze. Now, it is
not that bronze was all that rare in Greece then, it is just that bronze was valuable and could easily be recycled. It would
have been relatively easy for a person with knowledge of metals to melt down bronze objects and forge them into ? well, say,
coins. Bronze was used to made money back then. Or mold the bronze into anything else of value for that matter.
We are very fortunate that the device ended up under water, because otherwise it probably would have ended up
recycled into ? who knows what. Now, it was a challenge to figure out the Antikythera Mechanism. It spent over 2,000
years at the bottom of the sea before it was discovered. And even after it was discovered, it was still a number of years
before we really understood what it was. You see, the mechanism had corroded underwater, and many of the gears were
stuck together in a mass. Cleaning it was only partly successful. We could only get a good look at the structure of the gears
after gamma-rays were used to see inside, very similar to the way X-rays are used to see your bones.
Now, once we got a good look inside, we saw a really complex device. The many gears not only moved in a way that
could indicate the phases of the moon. The Antikythera Mechanism also tracked both the lunar year and the solar year.
206Additionally, the gears also moved to match the motions of the planet and predicted eclipses. But one thing that is
particularly notable is that the mechanism was so precise that it even took into account a particular irregularity in the moon's
orbit, which requires some very complex math to replicate in mechanical device.
You could say that the Antikythera Mechanism was a very precise calendar, which stands to reasons calendars were
very important to ancient peoples. Religious festivals had to be held at the right time of year, crops needed to be planted at
the right time as well. And let's not forget that eclipses in planetary motions had important symbolic meanings.
TPO23 Lecture2 - Environmental Science (Earth Budget)
Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an environmental science class.
Professor: Basically, a cloud either contributes to the cooling of Earth's surface or to its heating. Earth's climate systemis constantly trying to strike a balance between the cooling and warming effects of clouds.
It's very close, but overall the cumulative effects of cloud are to cool Earth rather than heat it. And this balance
between the amount of solar radiation, energy from the Sun, that's absorbed by Earth, and the amount that's reflected back
into space. We call this Earth's radiation budget. And one way we keep track of the radiation budget is by looking at the
albedo of the different surfaces on the planet.
A surface's albedo is the percentage of incoming solar energy, sunlight, that's reflected off that surface back into space.
Oceans have a low albedo, because they reflect very little energy. Most of the solar energy that reaches the ocean gets
absorbed and heats the water. Um... rainforests also have low albedos. Well, by contrast, deserts and areas covered by ice
and snow, these places have high albedos. And clouds, in general, cloud also have high albedos. That means that a large
percentage of the solar energy clouds receive is reflected into space.
OK. Now, when we say that clouds have a high albedo. We are talking about the effect of all the clouds on earth
averaged together. But different types of clouds have different reflective properties, they have different albedos.
Student: So which type of clouds cools Earth? And which type heat it?
Professor: Well, high thin clouds contribute to heating while low thick clouds cool Earth. High thin clouds are very
transparent to solar radiation, like, uh, clear air. So they mostly transmit incoming solar energy down to Earth. There's not
much reflection going at all. At the same time, these clouds trap in some of Earth's heat. Because of the trapped heat, these
clouds have an overall heating effect.
Student: Oh. OK. Since low thick clouds are not transparent to radiation...
Professor: Exactly. They block most of the solar energy so it never reaches Earth's surface. They reflect much of it back
out into space.
Student: So that's how they contribute to cooling?
Professor: Yep. And as I said earlier, this cooling effect predominates. Now, what if there was a process that could
control the type of clouds that form?
Student: Are you talking about controlling the weather?
Professor: Well, I am not sure I would go that far. But we recently noticed an increase in cloud cover over an area of
the ocean waters around Antarctica. An increased area of low thick clouds, the type that reflects a lare portion of solar
energy back to space and cools the Earth.
Well, the reason for this increased cloud cover, it turns out, is the exceptionally large amount of microscopic marine
plants. Well, the current hypothesis is that these microorganisms produce a chemical, dimetho sulfide that interacts with the
oxygen in the air, creating conditions that lead to the formation of the low thick clouds we observed. Well, that's true. It
could have huge implications. So, maybe we are talking about controlling the weather. Perhaps, if the microorganisms near
Antarctica really are responsible, perhaps we can accelerate the process somehow.
207TPO 23 Conversation 2
Narrator: Listen to a conversation between a student and his English professor.
Professor: Hi, Bob. How is it going? Are you enjoying the Introduction to Literature class?
Bob: Yeah, it's great. Araby, that short story by James Joyce we read last week, it was awesome.
Professor: I'm glad you like it. Most of Joyce's work is very complex. A lot of students say that he is hard to understand.
Normally, you wouldn't tackle Joyce in an Intro class, but I'd like to give my first year students a taste of his style, his
psychological approach to literature, because ? mainly because it influenced other writers. I only wish we had more class
time to discuss it.
Bob: Me too. So why did you pick Araby instead of some other story?
Professor: Well, um, first you should know that Araby is one of fifteen short stories by Joyce in a book called
Dubliners. Uh, all the stories are related to one another, and they are set in the same time period. But Araby is the easiest
one to follow. Though all the stories in the collection are written in stream of consciousness, which as you know, means
they are told through the narrator's thought, through an inner monologue, as opposed to dialogue or an objective description
of events. But Araby is easier because it's linear, the story unfold chronologically.
Bob: Still, I wish we could read whole novels by Joyce and discussed them in class.
Professor: That's what happens in my Master Writer Class.
Bob: Master Writer Class?
Professor: Yeah, I teach one on Joyce every spring. It's such a privilege, spending an entire term diving into a single
body of work. And my students, they bring so much insight to the table that it's easy to forget who the professor is.
Bob: Oh, wow. That could actually solve my dilemma, uh, what I originally wanted to ask you ? um, I am working on
my schedule for next term, and I've got room for one more course, and I'd like to take more literature. Could I take your
Master Writer Class on Joyce?
Professor: I'm sorry. I should have mentioned. Uh, Master Writer is an advanced seminar. So students need to get a
strong foundation in literary theory and criticism before I let them in the room.
Bob: But I have gotten really good grades on all my paper so far, I'm sure I can keep up. Couldn't you make an
exception?
Professor: Your grades are excellent. But in our intro class, you are reviewing the basics, like plots, setting and
character and getting your first real exposure to different literary styles.
Bob: But why do I have to study different styles to understand Joyce's novels?
Professor: There are a lot of little details involved in interpreting literature. And like with Joyce. His novels have very
unique structures. The only way to appreciate how you meet there is by studying a variety of authors.
Bob: Oh, OK. So could you suggest a different literature class then?
Professor: Sure. There's doctor Clain's course on nineteenth-century novels. It's more focused than the class you're in
now. But it will build on your current knowledge base and give you the background you need. That, plus a couple more
foundational classes, and you will definitely be ready for my seminar.
Bob: Sweet. Thanks.
TPO23 Lecture3 Biology (Dolphins)
Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a marine biology class.
Professor: We have been talking about how sea animals find their way underwater, how they navigate, and this brings
up an interesting puzzle, and one I'm sure you'll all enjoy. I mean, everybody loves dolphins, right?
And dolphins, well, they actually produce two types of sounds. Uh, one being the vocalizations you are probably all
familiar with, which they emit through their blowholes. But the one we are concerned with today is the rapid clicks that they
208use for echolocation, so they can sense what is around them. These sounds, it has been found, are produced in the air-filled
nasal sacs of the dolphin.
And the puzzle is how does the click sounds get transmitted into the water? It's not as easy as it might seem. You see,
the denser the medium, the faster sound travels. So sound travels faster through water than it does through air. So what
happens when a sound wave um ? OK.
You've got a sound wave traveling merrily along through one medium, when suddenly; it hits a different medium, what
does gonna happen then? Well, some of the energy is going to be reflected back, and some of it is going to be transmitted
into the second medium. And ? and ? and if the two media have really different densities, like air and water, then most of the
energy is going to be reflected back, very little of it will keep going, uh, get transmitted into the new medium. I mean, just
think how little noise from the outside world actually reaches you when your head is underwater.
So, how did the dolphin's clicks get transmitted from its air-filled nasal sacs into the ocean water? Because given the
difference in density between the air in the nasal cavity and the seawater, we'd expect those sounds to just kind of go
bouncing around inside the dolphin's head, which will do it no good at all. If it's going to navigate it, needs those sounds to
be broadcast and bounced back from objects in its path. Well, turns out dolphins have a structure in their foreheads, just in front of their nasal sacs, called a melon. Now, the
melon is kind of a large sac-like pouch, made up of fat tissue. And this fat tissue has some rather fascinating acoustical
properties. Most of the fat that you find in an animal's body is used for storing energy, but this fat, which you find in
dolphins, and only in the melon and around the lower jaw. This fat is very different, very rich in oil. And it turns out it has a
very different purpose as well.
Now, one way to um, modify the overcome this mismatch in the density of air and water would be ? if you travels
through velocity of the sound wave, make it precisely match the speed at which water. And that's exactly what marine
biologists have discovered the melon Note that the bursa, these little projections at the rear of the melon, are right up against
the air-filled nasal sacs. And these bursa, it turns out, are what's responsible for transferring sound to the melon.
The sound waves are then transmitted by the bursa through the melon. First through a low velocity core, and then
through a high velocity shell, where their speed is increased before they are transmitted into the surrounding seawater. So
now the signals can be efficiently transferred into the water, with minimal reflection.
The only other place, this special fatty tissue, like that in the melon, the only other place is found in the dolphin, is in
the lower jaw. Turns out that the lower jaw, well, it is made of a specially thin bone. And it is very sensitive to vibrations, to
sound energy traveling through the seawater. It turns out that the jaw is primarily responsible for capturing and transferring
returning sound waves to the dolphin’s inner ear. So these rapid clicks that are sent out bounce off objects, maybe a group of
fish swimming over here, a boat coming from over there. The sounds bounce off them and the lower jaw captures the
returning sounds, making it possible for the dolphin to sense what's in the surrounding water and decide where to swim.
TPO23 Lecture4 Choreography (Screen Dance)
Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a choreography class.
Professor: Now, when you think about choreography, well, uh, for your last assignment, you choreographed the dance
that was performed on stage in front of live audience. Now, screen dance is very different. It is a dance routine you will be
choreographing specifically to be viewed on a screen, on a computer screen, a TV screen, in a movie theater, any screen. So
the question we have to ask is, what's the difference between choreography for a live performance and choreography for
on-screen viewing?
OK. Think for a minute. When you see a movie, is it just a film of people acting on a stage? Of course not. Movies use
a variety of camera angles and creative editing. Movies can distort time, slow movement down, or speed it up, show actors
fading in and out of scenes, etc. All of these ? all of these film-making techniques, things that can't be used in a live
performance, are possible in a screen dance. Now, we'll cover these concepts in greater detail later, but you should be
getting the idea that I don't want you to just film dancers on stage and turn it in as your screen dance project. Uh, Yes?
209Debbie.
Student: But isn't something lost here, Professor Watson? I am a dancer, and when I perform on stage, I am so
energized by the audience's reactions, the applause. I actually, and for a lot of dancers, it ? it really inspires us.
Professor: You're right. Screen dance, which is a relatively new, isn't for everyone. Uh, some dancers may seemreluctant to participate in your project, because they do thrive on the immediacy of performing live. If this happens, you
could point out that screen dance offers other ways for dancers to connect to their audience. For example, dancers can
express themselves, even change the whole mood of the scene through a facial expression. And you could film close-up
shots of their faces. Facial expressions aren't as important in live performances generally, because the choreographer knows
that someone in the back row of a theater may not be able to see a dancer's face clearly.
Student: But ? um, I have never used a movie camera or edited film before. How will we learn everything we need to
know to ? ?
Professor: Oh, don't worry. The cameras you will be using are pretty simple to operate. And you'll get to play with the
film-editing software several times before beginning your project. You'll also have the option of working with a student in
the film department, someone who's familiar with the technology. But the choreography and the end result will be your
responsibility of course.
Student: Could you talk some more about the film - making techniques, you know, the ones that work best forscreen
dances?
Professor: I'll show some of my favorite screen dances next week to give you a better idea. But, uh, OK. Here's one
technique that can create the illusion of flow in a screen dance. You film the same dancer, entering and exiting the frame
several times. Moving slowly at first, then faster and faster. Then in the editing room, you can digitally manipulate these
images, like you might put five or ten or twenty copies of that same dancer meeting himself in the middle of the screen, to
make it look like he is dancing with himself.
Obviously, this can't be done in a live performance. Another example, in one screen dance I saw, the dancers leap
through sheets of fire in a big abandoned building. Of course, the building wasn't really on fire. A technique called
super-imposing was used. The dancers were filmed and layered in the editing room. The fire was added to the background.
Student: That sounds awesome. But if anyone can watch a dance on a computer screen. Why would they pay to go see
a live performance? What if screen dance got so popular that it replaced live dance?
Professor: Screen dance is an entirely different type of presentation. It could never replicate the immediacy, the kind of
drama that live performance offers. There will be an audience for that. I think what screen dance will do, though, is heighten
awareness of dance in general. Because it is a way ? u h, it can reach people in their homes, in their workplaces, at anytime
really. And if someone discovers that they love dance by watching a screen dance, there's a good chance they will get
interested enough to buy a ticket to see a live performance.

Student: No, no. It's for a class I am taking now.
Clerk: Hmm...
Student: Oh, oh, you know what? Um, it's for a graduate class. Would that maybe make a difference? I mean, I am an
undergrad, but I am just taking this one class in the graduate department, so...
Clerk: No, no. I don't think that's it. That shouldn't make any difference. But, hmm... let me see... maybe it's just...it
could be that whoever that entered it misspelled the title or the author's name, so I can't find it on the computer and I can't
tell if it's sold out. But if it's sold out, we would probably be getting a new shipment within about a week or so.
Student: Well, uh, I was hoping to get it sooner because like we already have assignments and you know, I mean, I
guess I can get it from the library.

Clerk: Bye
211TPO 24 Lecture l-Biology (Crocodile Vocalization)
Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a Biology class.
Professor: OK. For today, let's look at a reptile, a predator that hasn't evolved much in the last seventy million years.
No discussion of reptiles would be complete without some mention of crocodiles.
Now, we tend to think of crocodiles as, uh, kind of solitary, hiding out in a swamp, uh, kind of mysterious creatures.
But we are finding out that they aren't as isolated as they seem. In fact, crocodiles interact with each other in a variety of
ways. One way is with vocalizations, you know, sounds generated by the animal. This is true of the whole crocodile family,
which includes crocodiles themselves, alligators, etc.
Take American alligators. If you were to go to a swamp during the breeding season, you'd hear a chorus of sounds,
deep grunts, hisses, these are sounds that male alligators make.
And some of them are powerful enough to make the water vibrate. This sends a strong, go-away message to the other
males. So the alligator can focus on sending other sound waves through the water, sound waves that you and I couldn't even
hear since they are at such low frequency. But they do reach the female alligator, who then goes to find and mate with the
male.
Vocalization is um...well, it is used for other reasons, like getting attention or just, um... letting others know you are
distressed. Let's see. New-born crocodiles, or hatchlings and their interactions with their mothers. When they are born,
croc... baby crocodiles have a sort of muffled cry while they are in their nest. Hatchlings are really vulnerable, especially to
birds and small mammals when they are born. But their mother, who has been keeping vigil nearby, hears their cry for help
and carries them to safety, meaning, to water.
So she takes them out of the nest. Uh, uh, all the eggs hatched at once, so she has about forty newborns to look after.
Well, she takes about fifteen out of the nest at a time, carrying them in her mouth to the nearby water. While she is taking
one load of hatchlings, the others wait for her to come back.
But do you think they are quiet about it? No way. They are clamoring for the mother's attention, sort of squeaking and
practically saying-don't forget about me!
I heard some great examples of this on the television program on crocodiles last week. Anyone catched it? It had a few
interesting bits. But you know, uh, you have to be careful, think critically. Sometimes I don't know where these shows find
their experts.
Student: Excuse me. But, um... does all that crying defeat the purpose? I mean, doesn't it attract more predators?
Professor: Hmm...good question. I guess, well, I am guessing that once the babies have the mother's attention, they are
safe. She's never too far away, and, and I think...I mean, would you mess with a mother crocodile?
So after the mother transports all the youngsters, they still call to each other, and to their mother. This communication
continues right through to adulthood. Crocodiles have about eighteen different sounds that they can make.
There's...um...um… you have deep grunting sounds, hisses, growls, are many different sounds to interact or send
messages. This is more typical of mammals than of reptiles. I mean, crocodiles' brains are the most developed of any reptile.
In that sense, they are closer to mammals' brains than other reptiles' brains. And we know that mammals, dogs for example,
dogs vocalize many different sounds. Crocodiles have a similar level of, uh, vocal sophistication, if you will, which makes
them unique among reptiles.
Another thing would be, um, if a hatchling gets separated from the rest of its family, once the others get far enough
away, its survival instinct kicks in. It will make a loud distress call, which its siblings answer. It calls again. And they
continue calling back and forth until they all find each other again.
Another thing, something that wasn't on that TV show I mentioned. Um... mother crocodiles lead their young from one
area to another, like when they have to find a different source of water. Usually she will lead them at night, when it is safer
for them, moving ahead and then letting out calls of reassurance so that they will follow her. Her voice helps give the babies
the courage they need to leave the area and go some place that's a more desirable home for them.
212TPO 24 Lecture2-Art History (Modern Dance)
Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a dance history class.
Professor: As we have been studying, ballet, the classical ballet, is based on formalized movements, specific
positioning of the arms, feet and the body. So, now let's move on to modern dance, also known as theatrical dance. Modern
dance evolved in the late nineteenth, early twentieth century, and in most cases, audiences were very receptive to this radical
new type of performing art.
Student: Um... what made modern dance so radical?
Professor: Well, for example, I think the best analogy to modern dance is modern art or modern music. Compared to
their classical predecessors, these newer art forms are freer, more experimental, more improvisational.
Modern dance seeks to show how deep emotions and the music itself, how these intangible attributes can affect and
inspire physical movement, and how movement can convey emotions to the audience. As I said, in classical ballet, emotions
are conveyed through a set of strictly formalized movements.
Now, a pioneer of modern dance was Isadora Duncan, who was born in 1878. Isadora Duncan did study ballet briefly
as a child, but she quickly developed her own unique style, which she called free dance. And by age fourteen, she was
teaching her free dance to young children and giving recitals.
Her early dance technique was loosely based on the natural movements of children, running, skipping, acting out
stories, also on motions from nature, waves crashing onto shore, trees swaying in the wind. Her expressive gestures were
motivated from within rather than from being dictated by strict technique. Duncan also wore her hair down, ballerinas
typically wear their hair in a tight bun behind the head. And instead of the short steep skirts and rigid toeshoes worn by
ballerinas, Duncan wore loose, flowing tunics, and she dance bare foot. Now, that was something her audiences had never
seen before.
Duncan performed in Paris composers, but avoiding set audiences, for the most part, and other European cities,
dancing to the music of classical movements and steps, no two performances were alike. And adored her.
In 1904, she opened a school of modern dance in Berlin. And the next year she performed in Russia. But the Russian
critics were not really kind. Some said Duncan's art form was closer to pantomime than to dance. But her style was a clear
rebellion against ballet, and ballet is extremely important in Russia. A question, Julie?
Student: Yeah. What did Duncan have against ballet? I mean, she studied it as a child.
Professor: As a youngster, she might have found it too restrictive, uh, not creative enough. I think that feeling is
exemplied by something that happened earlier in her career, in Russia. Duncan attended a ballet, and the lead dancer was the
renowned Russian ballerina，Ana Pavlova. The following day, Pavlova invited Duncan to watch her practice.
Duncan accepted but was appalled by what she saw. To her, the exercises that Pavlova and the other ballerinas were
doing seemed painful, even harmful, standing on tiptoe for hours, moving their bodies in unnatural ways. After seeing this,
Duncan publically denounced ballet as a form of acrobatics, uh, complicated and excruciating mechanism she called it. This
critic generated I think some undue rivalry between ballet and modern dance, and it would take a long time, many years in
fact, for the rivalry to calm down.
TPO 24 Conversation 2 一 Student & Geography Professor
Narrator: Listen to a conversation between a student and his geography professor.
Student: Hi. Professor Brown.
Professor: Hi. Paul. What can I do for you?
Student: I have a question about the final exam. I mean, will it cover everything we've done all term? Or just what
we've been doing since the mid-term exam.
Professor: Everything we've done all term.
Student: Oh, boy. You know, I am still not too clear about the hydrologic cycle, um, the transfer of water back and forth
213between the earth and the atmosphere. I really blew the question about it on the mid-term exam. I want to do better on the
final exam. But I am still having trouble with it.
Professor: Well, uh, have you been to the tutoring center?
Student: No, not for geography anyway. Isn't that just for when you need help with writing, like an essay or a research
paper.
Professor: Oh, no. you can get tutoring in a lot of subjects. Some graduate students from this department tutor there.
Student: That's good to know. But I hardly go there because I have a part-time job. I never seem to be free when they
are open.
Professor: Well, they will be extending their hours when final exams begin. You might try then. But um... Well, since
you are here now, can I help you with something?
Student: Well, the hydrologic cycle. I remember we went over a diagram in class. And from what I remember, water
changes back and forth from water in lakes and oceans to vapor, and then back to water again when it falls as rain or snow,
as precipitation. It's constantly being recycled through evaporation and condensation.
Professor: That's it. Basically. Um... so exactly what is it you don't understand?
Student: OK. I guess what I am really confused about is how the topography of the land, the mountains and valleys and
stuff, affects precipitation.
Professor: OK. Good question. Precipitation is influenced by topography among other things. Um, why don't we talk
about lake-effect snow? It's a phenomenon that occurs anywhere you have a large lake that doesn't freeze and have cold air
flowing over it, mostly in the Northern Hemisphere
Student: Like the great lakes in the United States?
Professor: Yeah. What happens is that the cold arctic air blows across the lake from the north in winter. And as the air
crosses the lake, the lower layer is warmed by the lake water, which is much warmer than the arctic air. And as this air is
warmed and picks up moisture, it becomes lighter than the air above it.
Student: So it starts to rise, right?
Professor: Yes. And clouds begin to form. When the air gets closer to the shore, it's slowed down by the land and starts
to pile up. So it rises even faster because it has nowhere else to go, that's where topography comes into the picture.
Student: And then it snows because as the air rises, it cools off and loses its capacity to hold water vapor.
Professor: That's right.
Student: OK. Thanks. Any chance you'll have this question on the final?
Professor: I don't know yet. But you seem to have a handle on it.
TPO 24 Lecture3-Archaeology (Megafauna in North America)
Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an archaeology class.
Professor: Between 11,000 and 10,000 B.C.E., North America was populated by a wide variety of great beasts, like
mammoth and mastodons, both elephant-like creatures with big tusks, and camels, giant sloths, the list goes on. By about
10,000 B.C.E., all those giant creatures, the Metgauna of North America were gone. We don't know exactly what happened
to them, but there are some theories.
One theory is that they were hunted to extinction by humans. The humans who coexisted with these giant species in
North America at that time were what we today called the Clovis Peopple. And there is a Clovis site in a valley in southern
California where the remains of thirteen mammoths were found. And spear points, tools for processing meat, and fire
places.
That would appear to be some pretty compelling evidences. Mammoth bones have also been found at some other
Clovis sites.
But then at other Clovis sites, there's also a lot of evidence that the Clovis people mostly gather plants and hunted small
game, like rabbits and wild turkeys. Also there are several places in North America where you have natural accumulations
of mammoth bones that look very similar to the accumulations at the Clovis site, except there's no human debris, where the
mammoth almost certainly died as a result of some kind of natural disaster. So I think it is quite likely that those thirteen
214mammoths in southern California also died of natural causes, and that the Clovis people simply took advantage of the
situation. Um...OK. That's the hunting theory.
Now let's look at another theory, uh, an alternative to the hunting theory, the climate change theory. At around 11,500
B.C.E.，the world was coming out of an Ice Age .And with that came increased seasonality, that is, the summers became
warmer, and the winters actually became colder. These extreme shifts would have put a lot of stress on the bodies of animals
that were used to a more moderate range of temperatures.
But the most important impact of this increased seasonality may very well have been its effect on the distribution of
plants.
Today we take for granted that there horizontal bands of plant communities. In the far north, it is tundra, which gives
way to forest as you move southward. And even farther south, grasslands take over. But during the Ice Age, these plant
communities actually grew together, mixed with one another. So Ice Age animals had access to many different types of
plants, different types of food. But when the seasons became more distinct, the plant communities were pulled apart, that
meant, in any given area, there was less plant diversity. And as a result, uh, so the theory goes, the Ice Age animals that
depended on plant diversity couldn't survive. And the great beasts were the ones that needed the most diversity in their diet. Again, we have what at first seems like a pretty attractive theory, but then, how do you explain the fact that this has
happened before? You know, global cooling followed by global warming, and there was no extinction then.
Uh, you know, I recently read an interesting article about an archaeologist who tried to solve this puzzle with the help
of his computer. What he did was, he wrote a computer program to simulate what would happen to mammoth under certain
conditions. Say, for example, there is a drought for a couple of decades, or hunters are killing or five percent of the
population, and so on. One thing he found was that humans didn't necessarily have to kill these animals in great numbers in order to nudge
them toward extinction. That's because very large animals have a slow rate of reproduction, so all you have to do is remove
a few young females from the herd, and you can, fairly quickly, significantly reduce the population. And then he came up
with a scenario that combined some hunting by humans with some environmental stress, and...Bang! The simulated
mammoths were extinct within decades.
So it seems the mixture of hunting and climate change is a likely scenario. Uh, of course, computer simulations are not
a substitute for hard evidence.
TPO 24 Lecture4-Astronomy (Shield Volcanoes on Venus)
Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an astronomy class.
Professor: Many people have been fascinated about Venus for centuries because of its thick cloud cover, this so-called
planet of mystery and all of that. Well, what's under those clouds? What's the surface of the planet like? Some questions
about the surface are still unresolved but, but we have learned a lot about it in the past several years.
First of all, let me talk about how we have been able to get past those clouds. First, there were Soviet modules2 that
landed directly on the surface and sent back some images of what was around them. Second, we did some radar imaging
from satellites from above. Radar can get through the clouds. So what have we learned? Yes, Karen?
Student: Well, I remember reading that there's not really a lot going on, that the surface of Venus is just flat and smooth
in a lot of places.
Professor: Yeah, smooth in a lot of places. But that's not, um... that's not the whole picture. In other areas, you've got
canyons, ripped valleys, meteo craters, uh, lava domes, these lava formations that look like giant pancakes. And also
volcanoes.
Well, one of the most interesting features on the surface are in fact the shield volcanoes. Shield volcanoes formed when
magma comes out of the ground in the same spot over and over again. Remember, magma is hot molten rock that's
underground, and it is called lava when it reaches the surface. Uh, so the lava builds up, and hardens, and a volcano forms.
Now, the lava on Venus is thin. It spreads out easily. So shield volcanoes have very gentle sloping sides. They are
called shield volcanoes, because viewed from above, they kind of resemble shields, you know, like a warrior's shield.
But what's particularly interesting about these volcanoes is that most of the volcanoes here on Earth are not shield
volcanoes. Instead, they are other volcano types, like strata volcanoes, for example, which are a result of tectonic plate
215movement. Remember tectonic plates?
Underneath the Earth's crust, there are a number of shifting slabs or plates that are slowly moving. And in the zones on
the edges of the plates where different plates meet and interact, that's where we get most of Earth's volcanoes
On Venus, however, volcanoes are not clustered in discrete zones like they are on Earth. Instead, they are more or less
randomly scattered over Venus's surface. Well, that's significant. Venus has mostly shield volcanoes, and they are randomly
scattered, that indicates that Venus does not have moving tectonic plates, and that's a big difference compared to Earth. Here
on Earth, moving tectonic plates are a major geological element, just crucial for the whole surface dynamic, right?
So why doesn't Venus have them? Well, there are a few theories. One of them is that this has to do with the fact that
Venus has no surface water that's needed to kind of lubricate the movement of the plates, you know, like oceans on Earth.
Yeah, I forgot to spell that out. Uh, Venus has no surface water.
Student: Wait a second. Did you say we have shield volcanoes on Earth? Can you give an example?
Professor: Sure. The volcanoes in the Hawaii islands, in the Pacific Ocean are shield volcanoes. They are formed over
a hot spot of magma. So while on Earth we have several types of volcanoes, on Venus there's mostly the one type. Uh, Eric?
Student: Are the volcanoes on Venus still active?
Professor: Well, that's an interesting question. There is still some discussion on that point. But here's what we do now.
First, the level of sulfur dioxide gas above Venus's clouds shows large and very frequent fluctuations. It is quite possible that
these fluctuations, the huge increase and decrease of sulfur dioxide, happening again and again. It's quite possible that this is
due to volcanic eruptions, because volcanic eruptions often emit gases. If that's the case, volcanism could very well be the
root cause of Venus's thick cloud cover. And also we have observed bursts of radio energy from the planet's surface. These
bursts are similar to what we see when volcanoes erupt on Earth. So this too suggests ongoing volcanic activity. But
although this is intriguing evidence, no one's actually observed a Venus volcano erupting yet, so we can't be positive.

Listen to a conversation between a student and his academic advisor.
Professor
Hi, Mark. What can I do for you?
Student
I am just filling out this approval for graduation form for the dean's office, and I don't know, I hope I will be able to
graduate next semester.
Professor
Well, as long as you've met the departmental requirements and you submit the form on time, you shouldn't have any
problem. Make sure you include all the classes you will have taken for your degree in finance and the electives too.
Student
216Yeah, but as I look over the form, I got confused because of the way, um…they've changed the requirements. So now I amnot sure I will be qualified to graduate next semester. I know I would, before, under the old requirements.
Professor
Well, when the business department changed the curriculum to include more courses in international business, to ... well,
because of the increasing globalization of business. We made sure that students who have finished their second year, that is,
those who are in their third or fourth year, wouldn't be affected. The new rules only apply to students in their first or second
year.
Student
That's good to know. Uh... the department's hiring new faculty too I heard, to teach some of the new courses. But I want to... Professor
Yes. One new faculty member has been hired. She will be teaching International Banking as a matter of fact.
Student
Actually, that's what I want to ask about - International Banking. I took International Banking l, but I never took
International Banking 2. It used to be that the second semester of International Banking was an elective, but now it says it's
a required class.
Professor
Yes. But that's one of the recent changes. So...
Student
Oh, Oh, OK. Oh. And ... and I am planning to take a management course next semester, but I don't know if it's ... if it will
count toward my major.
Professor
What's the course?
Student
Organizational Behavior.
Professor
Yes. That will count toward your major. That's a difficult class, you know. But well worth it. So it looks like you will have
all the required classes you need. You should be just fine.
Uh... I assume you have taken a seminar?
Student
Yeah, I took the marketing seminar.
Professor
OK. You are looking good. Just to be on the safe side, why don't you talk to someone in the dean's office before you give
them the form?
217Student
OK. So should I just explain to them that even though one of these classes got changed from an elective to a required class,
I don't have to take it?
Professor
Yes. You've met the requirements for graduation. And if there's something I need to do ... if I need to write a letter or
whatever, just let me know.
Student
OK. Thanks. I'll let you know if I need that letter.
Lecture1-Conservation Biology [Assisted Migration)
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a Conservation Biology class.
Professor
One consequence of global warming is extinction. There's compelling evidence that global warming will be a significant
driver of many plant and animal extinctions in this century. So we are considering various strategies to help some threatened
species survive this unprecedented, this warming trend which, as you know, is caused mainly by greenhouse gases produced
by the burning of fossil fuels.
Um... the most radical strategy being debated among conservation biologists is Assisted Migration. Assisted migration
means picking up members of a species, or members of a group of interdependent species and physically moving or
translocating them. Um... translocating threatened species to a cooler place, to higher latitudes or higher elevations, for
example.
Now, migration is a natural survival strategy. Over the past two million years, colder glacial periods have alternated with
warmer interglacial periods. And so, um, in response to these gradual climatic swings, some species have shifted their
ranges hundreds of kilometers.
So perhaps you are wondering why not let nature take its course now? Well, we can't. The main problem is today's
fragmented habitats. During previous interglacial periods, when glaciers retreated, they left behind open land in their wakes. Today human development has paved over much of the natural world. Ecosystems are fragmented. Housing developments,
highways and cities have replaced or sliced through forests and prairies. There are a few quarters left for species to migrate
through without help. So conservationists are trying to save as many species as possible.
Now, assisted migration could become a viable part of our rescue strategy, but there are a number of uncertainties and risks.
218Without more research, we can't predict if Assisted Migration will work for any given species. A translocated species could
die out from lack of food, for example. At the other extreme, we might successfully translocate the species, but within five
or ten years that species could proliferate and become an invasive species. Like a non-native plant that chokes out native
plants by hogging the nutrients in the soil. Translocated animals can become invasive too. It happened in Australia. The
cane toad was introduced back in 1935 to control an insect pest that was destroying Australia's sugarcane plantations. But
the cane toad itself became a pest and has destroyed much of the wildlife on that continent.
Also, many species are interdependent, intimately connected to one another. Like animals that eat a certain plant and that
plant relies on a certain fungus to help it get nutrients from soil and on a certain insect for pollination. We probably have to
translocate entire networks of species and it's hard to know where to draw the line.
And in addition to all that, it is not even clear that assisted migration or any migration for that matter, will help at least for
some species. Earth was already in one of its warm interglacial periods when we started burning fossil fuels. And in the
twenty-first century, global temperatures are expected to rise two to six degrees. That rate of heating is far greater than
during the last glacial retreat some 12,000 years ago.
Um ... whether to use Assisted Migration, this debate is mostly within the biology community right now. But the ultimate
decision-makers, in the United States at least, will be the government agencies that manage natural resources. Assisted
Migration really needs this level of oversight, and soon. Currently there's no public policy on using assisted migration to
help species survive climate change. People aren't even required to seek permits to move plants or invertebrate animals
around as long as they are not classified as pests. In one case, a group of conservationists has already taken it upon itself to
try on their own to save an endangered tree, the Florida Torreya tree, through Assisted Migration.
There's only about a thousand individual Florida Torrey as left. And global warming is expected to significantly reduce or
eliminate this tree's habitat. So this conservation group wants to translocate seedlings, Florida Torreya seedlings, 500
kilometers north in order to expand the species' range. The group believed its effort is justified, but I and many other
biologists will be watching very closely how this maverick group makes out, because like I said, there could be unintended
consequences.
Lecture2-Music History (Béla Bartók)
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a music history class.
Professor
So I just finished reviewing your papers on the influence of nationalism on the composers' music. And initially I was
219surprised none of you chose to write about Béla Bartók, that is until I remembered we haven't had a chance to discuss him in
class yet. He was a wonderful and ground-breaking composer.
Béla Bartók was a Hungarian, whose life stretched from the late nineteenth century to the middle of twentieth century. But
he was not a fan of the Romantic style of music that was popular in his homeland during his youth.
Student
Wait, Hungary wasn't a country in 1900, was it?
Professor
You are right. I should have been clear. Bartok was born in Austria-Hungary, a nation that broke apart when he was about
forty years old. Actually, the town where he was born is presently part of Romania. The political history of that region is
complex. Suffice to say that Bartok is generally known as a Hungarian composer.
So during Bartók's youth, the music played in the concert halls of Austria-Hungary was dominated by Romantic pieces by
mostly German composers. We discussed the Romantic style last week. These pieces were long and lyrical. They were
meant to have a sort of grandeur about them. And in the early 1900s, composers who worked in the Romantic style were the
most popular in Austria-Hungary. But Bartok, he was part of the musical community that was trying to change this. And it
led him to ... well, the first thing it did was lead him to travel（此处，演讲者就是有语法错误，理解意思就行）. He looked
at the countryside for the music of the farmers and the people who lived in small towns, and their music, well, you could say
he discovered the music that was popular in those areas.
Student
What do you mean?
Professor
Well, all the music we have been talking about the past few weeks, it really was all in the cities, that's where the composers
and the orchestras were. Out in remote areas of the countryside, in rural locations, music was more traditional, the same
songs that were enjoyed by previous generations. Bartók went out, he travelled to a significant portion of Eastern Europe
actually. He roamed the countryside and listened to the music heard in small towns and in all sorts of celebrations. He
attended weddings, dances and religious ceremonies, where he heard a very different sort of music from the Romantic stuff
being played in the concert halls in the cities. The music he heard is what we would consider folk music.
Student
And then he had those same songs played in the concert halls?
Professor
No. At first he went around to document the folk music. He really wanted to make sure the folk songs were written down
before they disappeared. In fact, Bartók didn't start out the trip thinking of himself as a composer. He was an
ethnomusicologist. He studied the traditional music of the region. But it turns out that what would later have a notable
influence on European music on the whole, was the way Bartók used elements he heard in folk songs in his own
220compositions. He adopted a number of elements from what he heard, like unusual rhythms. And he liked to use the
glissando as his hallmark, which he probably got from listening to Croatian folk music. A glissando is ... well, I have got a
recording of Bartok here. Let's wait until the music is fresh in our minds Susie, do you have something you want to ask
first?
Student
Yeah. Before, you mention nationalism and…
Professor
Ah, right, yes. When Bartok had his new pieces performed, their folk music roots made them instantly popular. It happened
to be a time of strong nationalism in Austria-Hungary, so his compositions came at just the right time. He became very
successful there. Particularly, when Bartok's ballet The Wooden Prince opened, there was great excitement for music that
included musical elements from local folk songs, music that reflected the region's musical traditions. However, as popular
as Bartok was in his homeland, he did not get much international recognition during his lifetime.
Conversation2
Narrator
Listen to a conversation between a student and his biology professor.
Student
Well, you know, I am writing that paper about whales and the path they travel as they swim through the ocean, their
migration patterns.
Professor
Yes. I remember.
Student
And well, I was thinking about it and I realized I don't understand how they hold their breath underwater. lt's a little crazy
for me to be writing about migration patterns without actually knowing how they stay underwater for so long.
Professor
Did you do any research to find out how they do it?
Student
Yeah, I did. I searched on the internet and there was a lot of information about whales, their habitats, the way they
communicate, you know, their songs. But if there was anything about whales and how they hold their breath, I missed it.
I've got a bunch of books. Actually, I have got so much information, it's a little overwhelming.
221Professor
I am surprised there is nothing about it in any of those books.
Student
Well, to be honest, l've only skimmed them so far. I am still working on finding sources.
Professor
OK. I know I encourage everyone in class to look at a substantial number of sources, but I don't want you to get
overwhelmed. Looking at a number of sources gives you a good knowledge base, but students only have a limited amount
of time to work on each paper. I don't expect you to read a dozen books on whales for this assignment. Focus on just a few.
Student
Ok. Thanks.
Professor
You know, since you are already here. I can give you a quick summary of how whales hold their breath underwater. lt's just
a matter of certain adaptations in their anatomies, specifically in their circulatory system.
Student
So the blood flow is what makes the difference?
Professor
Yes, and in a couple of ways. First, blood makes up a larger share of a whale's weight than in other mammals.
Student
So they can store more oxygen because they have more blood?
Professor
Yes, but that's only part of it. They also have a greater capacity than land animals to store oxygen in their blood.
Student
So how does having more oxygen in their blood help them stay underwater longer?
Professor
It's the way the whale's blood carries oxygen to the rest of its body. Whales carefully conserve their oxygen when
underwater in a couple of ways. When a whale dives, its metabolic rate drops, causing its heartbeat to slow down. And the
blood flow to its muscles and some of its non-vital organs, like its kidneys, is also cut off. A whale's muscles and non-vital
organs are able to function without oxygen for an extended period of time.
Student
I see. Well, now I can concentrate on my topic.
222Lecture3-History (Egyptian Hieroglyphs)
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a history class. The professor has been discussing Egyptian Hieroglyphs. Professor
Egyptian Hieroglyphs are the ancient Egyptian writings found in ancient Egypt on walls, monuments and on the inside and
outside of temples. Hieroglyphic writing ended abruptly about 1600 years ago. And it mystified the mot brilliant minds in
the study of Egyptian artifacts and archaeology for many many centuries. Finally, the possiblity of deciphering hieroglyphs
came about with the discovery, in 1799, of the Rosetta Stone. The Rosetta Stone is arguably the most famous archaeological artifact ever discovered. It contains the same exact text
written in three different alphabets: Greek, demotic, hieroglyphic.
But we didn't even know at first that the three texts on the Rosetta Stone contain the same information. And two of the three
alphabets are ancient Egyptian scripts that stop being used: the hieroglyphic and the demotic The demotic script found on
the Rosetta Stone, well, demotic was not as elaborate as hieroglyphic writing. It was used for more mundane matters, oh,
like administrative documents. These ancient Egyptian scripts were replaced by Coptic scripts. But eventually, the Arabic
language replaced Coptic and this cut off the linguistic link between ancient and modern Egypt.
Now, the Rosetta Stone was remarkable because as I said, on it, was the same text in three different alphabets: Greek,
demotic and hieroglyphic. The Stone was essentially the dictionary that scholars needed to interpret the meaning of the
hieroglyphs. And it took a uniquely equipped researcher to finally decipher and understand what was written on the stone.
Thomas young, an English scholar, was the first to seriously attempt to decipher the symbols on the Rosetta Stone. He
suspected rightly that the hieroglyphs were phonetic symbols, that they represented its sounds rather than pictures. Until
then, all scholars assumed that hieroglyphs were pictographs, that they symbolize objects or concepts. Thomas Young
focused his attention on one set of hieroglyphs that he thought would probably spell out a single word: the name of a King
or Queen. He guessed that the symbols represented the name of the early Egyptian ruler Ptolemy, since Ptolemy was also
written in Greek on the stone and was indeed a Greek name. And Young did actually prove that these hieroglyphs
represented sounds rather than whole words. Strangely though, he gave into the dominant thesis of the day that hieroglyphs
were pictographs. He actually dismissed his own findings as an anomaly because the Ptolemaic dynasty was Greek, not
Egyptian. in other words, he figured it was an exception to the rule. It was phonetic because it was Greek, not Egyptian.
How else could an Egyptian depict a Greek name other than spell it out? And that brings us to the hero of our story:
Jean-Francois Champollion.
Champollion built on Young's work, showing that different hieroglyphs spelled the names of Kings and Queens like
Alexander or Cleopatra. But his critics noted that this was still not traditional Egyptian names. He hadn't done any more
than Young had been able to do, so he couldn't disprove the dominant theory.
223Then in 1822, Champollion was shown a set of hieroglyphs that contain traditional Egyptian names. The first two of these
symbols were unknown, but Champollion knew that the repeated hieroglyphs to the far right symbolized an "S" sound. He
then drew on his linguistic knowledge to arrive at the solution to the problem. You see, unlike any of the other scholars who
had tried to crack the code, Champollion happened to be fluent in Coptic. He wondered, and this was the real breakthrough,
if Coptic was the language symbolized by the hieroglyphs on the Rosetta stone. And if so, then perhaps that first disc-shape
symbol might represent the Sun. And the Coptic word for Sun is "ra". See where this is headed? So if the symbol were
Coptic, the first symbol would be "ra". And then an unknown symbol followed by a double "S" sound. Was this,
Champollion wondered, the name Rameses1? He was eventually able to confirm that it was. So, he had figured it out.
Hieroglyphs were mainly phonetic, they represented sounds, not pictures, and the underlying language was Coptic. A lot of
work remained, but Champollion had cracked the code.

Lecture4-Animal Behavior
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an animal behavior class.
224Professor
All right. I hope you all had a chance to finish the assigned readings about animal play, because I want to spend some time
discussing the different viewpoints presented in those articles. Let's start with the play-as-preparation hypothesis. Jerry, can
you explain it?
Male Student
Yeah, Play-as-preparation. Young animals play in order to get really good at certain specific things they will need to do
when they are adults, things like chasing, pouncing, climbing. In other words, they play in order to practice survival skills,
like movements used in hunting and fighting. That hypothesis makes a lot of sense, like, maybe the most sense of all the
theories we read about.
Professor
And what leads you to that conclusion?
Male Student
Well, like wolves, the young pups, they fight a lot and bite, you know, not to hurt each other, but ... It just seems obvious
why those wolf pups play like that. It gives them practice with skills that will make them better hunters or fighters as adults.
Female Student
Oh, I don't know about that. I mean, some of the things a young animal does while playing are totally different from the
things they’ll do as an adult. There was a really good example in the second article. I can't remember what it is called
exactly, uh, self-…
Professor
Self-handicapping.
Female Student
Right. Self-handicapping. Like during a fake fight, a play fight, if one of the animals is winning, the winning animal might
just stop and give up its advantage.
Professor
Yes. And often it shifts to a submissive posture too. Of course self-handicapping hardly ever happens in a real fight.
Because in a real fight, well, the point is to win. So, this self-handicapping, it is important to take this into account before
just deciding to go with that first explanation. And in fact, there really isn't much in the way of solid experimental evidence
to support the play-as-preparation hypothesis.
Female Student
What about the other one? The flexibility hypothesis?
Professor
Ah, yes. Let's talk about that. As you say, play is much more than just pretend fighting or practicing other adult behaviors.
Apparently, it also contributes to the development of a brain that's flexible, a brain that's quickly able to get a handle on
225unfamiliar situations. This notion, the flexibility hypothesis, well, many of my colleagues find it quite persuasive.
Female Student
So, like with kids, a little kid might play a game with a friend, and then they might race each other across the field. So they
are switching from one type of play to another. There's a lot of variety? I mean, they are learning to respond to whatever
happens?
Professor
Well, that's the general idea. But let's hold off on talking about human behaviors from now. OK. According to the flexibility
hypothesis, yes, the diversity, the variety in play can lead to a broader behavioral vocabulary.
Male Student
A broader behavioral vocabulary? Can you explain what that means?
Professor
Well, sometimes playing results in an animal doing something it would not normally do. That can lead to the animal
learning to adapt, to come up with new behaviors that can help it cope with major problems later on, like staying safe or
finding food.
Female Student
Yeah. And there was that brain study you had us read about too.
Professor
Oh, the one on how play affects development within the brain?
Female Student
Right. That’s it. About the animals raised in an environment where they did not get opportunities to play?
Professor
Yes. Wasn't the conclusion interesting? That playing literally stimulates growth, creates connections within the brain? We
need to do further studies, but ...
Female Student
Excuse me, can we go back to play fighting for a minute? I am wondering, can the flexibility hypothesis really explain that?
Professor
Play fighting? Actually, that's something the flexibility hypothesis explains very well. Since play fighting includes
variations in speed and intensity, and quick role reversals involved with self-handicapping. An animal that's play fighting is
constantly responding to changes. So it's earning to be flexible.

226Conversation1
Narrator
Listen to a conversation between a student and a university print shop employee.
Student
Hi. I saw your ad in the campus news paper.
Employee
Oh. We don’t have any job opening right now.
Student
Oh, no. I meant the other ad, about the services you provide for students. You see, I have been working at the campus
tutoring center as a math tutor. But things have changed, including my schedule. And now I want to start doing tutoring
work independently. But in order to, basically, start my own business, I need to get the work out.
Employee
Ok.
Student
I was thinking I should get something printed up that I can hand out to people.
Employee
Ah. Well, actually, I just printed up some great-looking flyers for someone doing the same thing.
Student
Flyers. Yeah, that’s an idea. I guess then I could post them around the campus.
Employee
Yeah. And you can hand them out too. But, oh, you know what? I did something really neat for someone last week. She
didn’t want to go the traditional route, you know, business cards, flyers, so we customized pencils for her.
Student
Pencils?
Employee
Yeah. You know, a little message printed on the pencil.
Student
Oh, that’s cool.
Employee
Yeah. But you should know, it’s not our cheapest option. Oh, and you know those little sticky notes?
Student
You do those too?
Employee
Well, we did once. I think those bright pieces of paper would be real attention getters. You know, student use them all the
time, so they should be good for business. I don’t know why we haven’t done more.
Student
Wow.
Employee
So you’ve got some options.
Student
Right. Well, what about business cards? My friend has these business cards. She does tutoring too. And she got them at this
place in town, but they were kind of expensive.
Employee
For business card? Well, I don’t know what your friend paid. But we could do something real simple and it wouldn’t be
much. Like for a batch of 250 for one of our standard designs, 20 dollars maybe.
Student
20 dollars sounds okay.
227Employee
Now, there are some other choices that’ll affect the cost. You know, like different background patters, using color ink, that
sort of thing. And it also depends on how many words you want to include.
Student
Ok. Well, I know what I want them to say. But I am just thinking, I kind of like that pencil idea.
Employee
Yeah. I thought it was neat. Now, of course you can only fit your name and phone number, and like, in your case, math
tutoring on it.
Student
Right. Well, I could custom design the business cards through, right? That’s what my friend did. She said she designed themat the computer right there at the print shop.
Employee
Well, you can do that here too. But a custom design would be a bigger investment for your business than one of our standard
designs.
Student
Well, I don’t know. I am interested in business cards, so can I look at the standard designs?
Lecture1- Advertising(Green Marketing)
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an advertising class.
Professor
Last class someone asked about green marketing. Green marketing refers to companies promoting the products as
environmentally friendly. Companies often turn to advertising experts to help them do this.
Green marketing seems recent, but advertising professionals grew interest in it several decades ago. The seeds for green
marketing were probably planted in 1970, when the first Earth Day took place. Rallies all over the United States were
organized to protest environmental degradation. Some 20 million demonstrators participated in that first Earth Day. And it
helped spark dozens of environmental laws. The biggest was the Endangered Species Act of 1973, which protects imperiled
animal species from extinction. There was also passage of the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act was strengthened.
Earth Day, Environmental Laws, Environmental Issues in the news, Being Green was entering the mainstream. And
business started saying, hey, we can get involved in this. So in 1975, a major advertising trade group held its first workshop
on ecological marketing. A few years later, we began seeing ads tapping into people’s environmental concerns.
But some green marketers learned the hard way, green marketing must still involve all the same principles of a traditional
marketing campaign. You ad must attract attention, stimulate consumers’ interest, create a desire for your product, and
motivate people to take action to buy your product.
So let me tell you about one green marketing campaign that failed at first and explain why. It was a compact fluorescent
light bulb. We’ll call it the eco-light. It was first introduced, I believe, in the late 90s. It cost far more than a regular
incandescent bulb. The advertising message was, basically, “use this eco-light and save the planet”. But that message wasn’t
effective. Research shows that consumers don’t want to let go off any traditional product attributes, like convenience, price
and quality. Even though surveys indicate that almost everybody cares about the environment.
So the company reintroduced the eco-light with a new message, one that emphasized cost savings, that the eco-light lowers
electric bills and lasts for years. So it’s good for earth, cost-effective and convenient because it doesn’t have to be changed
every few months. This ad campaign worked like a charm.
228Something else, uh, the company that makes the co-light, researchers would consider it an ‘extreme green company’, not
only because its product are energy-efficient, but because the company tries to reduce its environmental impact in other
ways too．Like in addition to selling Earth— friendly products, its offices and factories are designed to conserve energy and
use all sorts of recycled materials．A company that only recycles office paper, researchers would classify as a ‘ lean green
company’．And there are other degrees of greenness in between．
So if your green marketing strategy’s gonna work, your message should be valid on all dimensions．When a company as a
whole is credited for reducing its environmental impact, this can lead to brand loyalty．People will come back and buy your
product more and more．However, let’s say you’re fine for violating the Clean Water Act while manufacturing products
from recycled materials. The public would eventually find out．You can’t just make the claim that a product is
environmentally friendly and not follow through on．
Lecture2-Biology(Carbon Cycling)
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a biology class
Professor
OK．Just before the end of the last class, we started talking about trace metals, metals found in living organisms in very
small quantities that serve an important biological, important nutritive function in those organisms．And one trace metal that
serves a nutritive function is zinc．
Zinc assists in a number of processes in humans, but we are going to focus on just one, one that applies to a number of
organisms, not just humans．See, zinc plays a major role in carbon cycling, the conversion of various kinds of molecules
with carbon, Iike carbon dioxide, into other kinds of molecules with carbon that organisms can use．So, take respiration．Our
bodies, our cells produce carbon dioxide when they
break down sugars．We need to get the CO2 out of our bodies, so the CO2 is converted into carbonic acid, which the blood
is able to carry to the lungs．Once the carbonic acid reaches the lungs, it’s converted back into carbon dioxide so that we can
breathe it out．
Now, this whole conversion process relies on a particular enzyme．Uh, who remembers what an enzyme is? Bob?
Student
Uh, it’s a protein, a specific kind of protein, one that speeds up chemical reactions.
Professor
Exactly．Different enzymes assist in different chemical reactions．Now, the one that speeds up the conversion of carbon
dioxide has zinc in it．So this zinc enzyme is critical for getting CO2 out of our bodies through the lungs．And it’s also
extremely important for plants．Bob, can you tell us why?
Student
For making food, for photosynthesis?
Professor
Exactly．For photosynthesis．Plants also convert carbon dioxide into different forms of carbon-containing molecules and the
conversion process used relies on the very same enzyme that works in humans．So zinc is also important for plants．
OK．But zinc is scarce in certain environments．And it’s particularly scarce in waters near the surface of rivers and lakes and
229shallower parts of oceans, which might make us wonder how plants could live there at all．In fact, there are a lot of marine
plants that survive, that grow and reproduce in surface waters．In particular, there are a lot of diatoms．
Diatoms are microscopic, photosynthetic organisms and they are a major source of food for other organisms in the
ocean．There are a number of different types of diatoms, and, well, diatoms play a very important role in the carbon cycling
process, because they help make carbon available to other organisms in deeper parts of the ocean．The carbon that these
diatoms use in photosynthesis is transferred to other parts of the ocean when the diatoms are eaten, say, by a fish that
absorbs the carbon and then swims to another part of the ocean, or when diatoms die and fall to the ocean floor.
So how did diatoms survive if zinc is so scarce? Well, recently researchers discovered that a specific type of diatom makes a
different enzyme that serves the same purpose．But this enzyme doesn’t contain zinc．Instead this new enzyme incorporates
another trace metal, cadmium．Kelly, you’ve got a question?
Student
Yeah．I thought cadmium was toxic．Didn’t you say that?
Professor
It is poisonous to humans．Uh. actually, we used to think that it was toxic to all biological life, that it didn’t serve any
biological purpose．But new study suggests that cadmium can actually substitute for zinc, that organisms can use it instead
of zinc when there isn’t enough zinc in their environment．
Now, the discovery of this cadmium—based enzyme is really important for a number of reasons．It’s actually the first
enzyme we have discovered that uses cadmium．So it’s possible that other not so typical trace metals may be used in
chemical processes, that marine organisms might make enzymes from other trace metals when the essential one is
scarce．And there may be other types of diatoms that use cadmium
to cycle carbon．
But there’s something else to think about．What is one of the most common greenhouse gases in our atmosphere, one of the
major culprits in global warming．Carbon dioxide, right?
Now, if all these diatoms are taking carbon dioxide from the surface, converting it and transporting it to the bottom of the
ocean, well, maybe there’s more to that whole process, that cycle, something that we’ve overlooked．So further research
might tell us more about these warming cycles too．
Conversation2
Narrator
Listen to a conversation between a student and her biology professor．
Professor
Hi, Jean．How was the…uh, the conference, right? the conference on volunteerism? That’s where you were last week．Student
Yeah. It was great. I met a lot of people from some really amazing organizations that are working in the area．Now it would
be a lot easier to get students to volunteer in the community．Plus, I’ve never been to any of the beaches here before．Being
at the beach was definitely a plus．
Professor
Well, I hope you had time to look over the notes from the class you missed．You did get the notes, right?
Student
Yup．I’II look them over before tomorrow’s class．
Professor
230Good．And let me know if you have any questions.
Student
Well, there is something that I wanted to ask you now．It’s about something I noticed at the beach．
Professor
Oh, what’s that?
Student
Well, see, there are a lot of jellyfish there, floating in the water.
Professor
That couldn’t have been pleasant.
Student
Not for swimming. But it was interesting. I mean, the jelleyfish were glowing．I swear they were．And I am wondering what
that’s about．
Professor
Ah, glowing jellyfish．That is interesting. Uh, it’s called bioluminescence．And actually we are going to talk about it later in
the semester．Basically, bioluminescence is light that’s produced by a chemical reaction.
Student
Really? Inside the jellyfish?
Professor
Well, not all jellyfish, about half of them．Actually, a lot of marine organisms have this ability, especially in deeper parts of
the ocean．
Student
Oh? I get it. Like the darker it gets, the more the fish needs light, right?
Professor
Well．bioluminescence serves a number of functions．Most aquatic organisms use it for communication and for attracting
prey．But jellyfish usually use it as a defense against predators．Some jellyfish produce bright flashes of light that confuse
predators, to, uh, to startle them．But jellyfish closer to the surface, probably like the jellyfish you saw, they use
bioluminescence to hide．The light they produce matches the color of the dim sunlight, so they blend in, and, uh, and
predators can’t see them．
Student
Wow, really? Well, I am looking for a topic for my term paper ,so maybe I could do it on these glowing jellyfish．That’s why
I wanted to ask you about them, you know, to find out if there was really something to write about．
Professor
It’s a great topic．But you’II have to make sure the topic is manageable．Like I said, about half of all jellyfish are
bioluminescent, so you may want to look at a particular type of jellyfish or several types that benefit from bioluminescence
in the same way, or you could investigate current research on bioluminescence, on, on the chemical process, or…Here’s an
idea．You seem to be very involved in local issues．See if you
can identify the jellyfish you observed on the beach and how they fit into the local ecosystem．
Student
Yeah, you know, some of the environmental groups I met last week might even be able to help me．
Lecture3-Astronomy (Comets)
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an astronomy class.
231Professor
0K．We have been looking at some of the smaller members of our solar system, comets．You already know about the
structure of comets．Let’s continue our discussion now by talking about orbits, especially those of the so-called
periodic-orbit comets．These are the comets that circle around the Sun pretty regularly．They return again and again,
predictably, after a certain period of time．That’s why we say their orbits are periodic．Probably the most famous and
brightest of these is Halley’s comet．
Halley’s comet comes from far out in the solar system, goes in close to the Sun, and then out again．At its closest approach
to the Sun, Halley’s comet is about twice as close to the Sun as Earth is．And at its farthest．It's about thirty-five times
farther from the Sun than we are, which puts it out beyond Neptune. Basically, the idea here is that a periodic comet, with its
very elongated orbit, just keeps coming back around again and again．With Halley’s comet, well, it returns every 75 years,
roughly．
But where is Halley’s comet during most of this time? Well, like all orbiting bodies, a comet moves faster when it’s closer to
the Sun．So it only spends about a year or two in our neighborhood, inside the orbit of Jupiter．Most of its time is spent way
out beyond Jupiter’s orbit, poking along near the farther reaches of it own orbit．Because of this, we can only see Halley’s
for a few months every 75 years, first on its way in toward the Sun, and then on its way out again．
Now, you remember from our previous discussion that a comet’s nucleus ,its core, is made up of ice and dust, like a frozen
snowball．And as it approaches the Sun, it starts to heat up．And some of the ice vaporizes into gas and spreads out from the
nucleus．The gases that vaporize from the comet, the comet never collects them back again, so on every orbit, the comet
leaves part of itself behind．
OK．How old is this solar system ?Four and a half billion years．remember ?And Halley’s is going around the Sun once
every 75 years and losing stuff each time．So the comet should be long gone by now, right? I mean, how come Halley’s is
still there? After four and a half billion years．How could it be? Well, the answer is that this comet hasn’t always been in
such a short periodic orbit, since once a comet gets into
an orbit that keeps it coming in close to the Sun quite frequently．Well, that comet’s probably not going to be around too
much longer. So this kind of periodic orbit is only a phase in a comet’s life．A phase that just precedes its final
breakup．We’ve seen comets do that, going toward the Sun and then come back around ,torn into pieces．
But lots of comets aren’t like that．They come in, pass behind the Sun, and then travel back out．But with an orbit so large,
and its farthest place so far away from the Sun that we just don’t know how far out it goes．We just can’t determine that very
accurately from the close-in part of the orbit that we do see．So these are often called parabolic-orbit comets．Parabolic
means the orbit is open at the far end．Actually the orbit probably does close and return the comet to the vicinity of the Sun
eventually, but the period might be tens of thousands of years．And basically, we can’t determine it．So we just, we refer to
them as open-ended parabolic-orbit comets．
So, what can change a comet with one of these long orbits where they only come by the Sun occasionally into a much more
frequent periodic visitor? Well, gravitational interaction with planets, right? lf a comet on one of these long period orbits at
some point comes close to Jupiter or Saturn or one of the other planets, then the pull of that planet’s gravity might alter the
orbit, maybe make it much shorter．So this comet, if it happens to pass by a planet just the right way, it can be drawn into a
new orbit, one that’ll capture it and keep it coming back around the Sun much more often．
232Lecture4-Art Conservation (Archimedes Palimpsest)
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an art conservation class.
Professor
So far we have been talking all semester about restoring and preserving pieces of art，like ancient frescos，early oil
paintings，etc．But although our field is called art conservation，it also involves…what?
Student
Um．．．preserving other types of cultural materials too
Professor
Very good．Not just art．Old artifacts are very valuable when they represent early technologies, all contain important
historical information．In fact，let me give you an example．You’ve heard about the Greek scholar Archimedes，who lived
more than 2，000 years ago，I am sure．Archimedes was a great mathematician．For example，he discovered the formula
for the volume of a sphere．Not much of his work has Survived，but what has Survived is brilliant．And then in 1906，a
Palimpsest of Archimedes’ writing was discovered．
Now, a palimpsest is a type of manuscript that contains writing that’s hidden because something else was written over it
later．I’ll explain in a minute．This Archimedes palimpsest, as it’s now called，is by far the most important palimpsest
anyone has ever seen．Because it contains the only known existing copy of Archimedes’treatise, called Method．Archimedes
shows in it how maths can be applied to physics and physical reasoning back to maths problems, which is how he calculated
the volume of the sphere，for example．This maybe commonplace today, but was revolutionary in his time．A few years ago,
the palimpsest was sold at an auction for 2 million dollars．It could have ended up tucked away in a private collection，but
fortunately, the collector who bought it has agreed to have experts restore every single word Archimedes wrote，so the
contents can be shared with the world and studied．
But there are two main problems．What do you think the first one might be?
Jennifer?
Student
Um…well，it sounds like it’s extremely old．So probably some pages are at the point of crumbling into dust?
Professor
True．And some are moldy, and some were eaten away at by bookworms．This thing’s really decayed．But on top of that，there’s another issue．And this is the reason why it’s a palimpsest．You see，the text apparently sat around in a library in
Constantinople until 1229 A．D．But then a scribe erased，scraped away the writing as clean as he could in order to use the
pages to write his own book on．Why would he
do that? Take a guess．
Student
Must have been a paper shortage?
Professor
Well? they used parchment to write on, but yes, there was a parchment shortage．
Student
So you are saying the parchment was basically recycled?
Professor
Correct．Then，even later on，in the twentieth century, a forger painted
ancient—looking pictures on several of the pages in order to make the book seem older and increase its value．So
unfortunately, that’s quite a history．
Student
But professor Wilkens，if the scribe scraped away Archimedes’words and if these paintings covered the pages，how can the
original work be recovered?
233Professor
Ah, that’s why I am telling you the story．That’s our task as conservationists, isn’t it? To find a way．There were still faint
traces of Archimedes’words on the pages．First，we tried to make the Archimedes’words stand out with a variety of
technologies，using ultraviolet light．But that didn’t work on every page．But then，there was this new idea that came froma scientist studying spinach．
Student
Spinach?
Professor
Yes．Spinach．This physicist，Uwe Bergman，does research that involves studying iron in spinach．He was reading an article
about problems with the palimpsest and it said that there is iron in the original Archimedes’ ink．So he came up with an idea
to use the same method of looking at iron in spinach to view the iron on the palimpsest pages．And his idea
worked．Bergman’s technique allows X—rays to pass through the forged paintings, pass through the scribe’s writing to hit
the iron traces from the ink of the original Archimedes’ text and create an image just of the iron on the pages．The
iron—based letters seem to just pop off the page．The original text and diagrams emerged，line by line．diagram after
diagram. And that’s kind of typical of our field．There’s a lot of interdisciplinary work．People from several different fields
might be
involved in working with a single art．

Librarian
Hi. Can I help you?
Student
Where do I go, besides the computers, to look for books on New Zealand?
Librarian
OK. You mean you don’t want to use the computer?
Student
Well, I haven’t had any luck on the computers here.
Librarian
OK. I mean the reason I am asking is you pretty much have to go to the computer to find out where a book is. But I can help
you find it on the computer if you like.
234Student
That would be great. I just spent half an hour and I couldn’t find anything.
Librarian
I know how you feel. When I first started working here, I couldn’t find anything either. So you are looking for information
on New Zealand, is that right?
Student
Yes.
Librarian
Is it like travel information that you are looking for?
Student
Uh… No. Actually what I am looking for is information on a volcano in New Zealand.
Librarian
Oh. OK. Because I know a travel agency that specializes in tours in New Zealand and Australia.
Student
Oh. I’d love to go. I heard it’s beautiful.
Librarian
Yeah.
Student
Maybe someday.
Librarian
Yup. OK. Let’s see … OK. If you want to search the library holdings and don’t know the author’s name or the exact title of
the book or an article, you have to set up a keyword search. It is a special function. Then you can just type in some
keywords and let the computer do the search.
Student
I see.
Librarian
OK. Oh, how about if we search for volcanoes and New Zealand.
Student
Sounds good.
Librarian
It’s for a geology class?
Student
Mhmm.
Librarian
235Ha! You must be from Professor Simpson’s class.
Student
No.
Librarian
Oh. Well, he is a volcano expert, so I thought he might be teaching your class.
Student
No, I’ve heard he is really good though.
Librarian
Yeah. That’s what everyone says. Do you know the name of the volcano?
Student
Mount Ruapehu.
Librarian
Can you spell that?

Sure. It is R-U-A-P-E-H-U.
Librarian
OK. Mount Ruapehu. Let’s see. So are you a geology major?

Let me guess, you have to take a science course and you don’t want to have to deal with biology, chemistry or physics.
Student
Exactly. But it’s actually turned out to be a pretty interesting class.
236Librarian
Well, that’s good. Um… does it have to be a book? Or could you use a journal article?
Student
Mhmm… no, either one would be fine.
Librarian
OK. Well, here’s a journal article. Let me check to see if we have it. OK. We have the article, but it is from 2001. Is that OK,
you think?
Student
Well, I’d like to have a look at it. The focus is really on eruptions in the last five years, but it might have some useful
background material.
Librarian
OK. Well, let’s see what else we can find.
Student
Sounds good.
237Lecture1-Marine Biology (Coral Reefs)
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a marine biology class.
Professor
So we have been fairly thorough in our discussion about coral reefs, which of course are prominent, oceanic features made
of hard limestone skeletons produced by tiny coral animals. We’ve gone over where coral reefs are usually formed – along
the edges of shallow ocean banks in tropical or subtropical regions, and the fact that they are declining at an alarming rate.
But I don’t want to leave you with the impression that all is lost. There are several techniques being employed today that
could prove useful in assuring the future of the reefs.
Now, we’ve talked in depth about coral bleaching, or whitening, which as you recall, is a symptom of …well that the coral
is suffering. As you know, coral is very sensitive to water temperature. Even though one or two degree Celsius rise in sea
surface temperature for a relatively short amount of time can cause bleaching. Recently, researchers have used data
collected by monitoring surface water temperatures to improve the ability of a reef to recover from bleaching. One future
possibility is that improved monitoring can help predict where and when bleaching will occur, which might potentially
enable us to mitigate its effects.
And there’s another technique that’s been experimented with to try to help coral reefs recover from bleaching. It’s called
coral transplantation. This involves moving young coral from a healthy reef onto a degraded reef, you know, in an attempt
to regenerate the degraded reef by encouraging young healthy coral to take over. There has been some success with this, but
it’s still somewhat controversial. Some scientists support it because, well for one thing, it means you don’t have to rely on
the existing coral to reestablish itself because it might not be able to. But in my opinion, transplanting coral should only be
used as … well as a last resort. I mean, this method is not only costly but it’s … well even if it’s successful, it still fails to
address the ongoing problem, the root causes of the degradation, which really is paramount to devising an effective solution.
So I don’t really take comfort in the successes they have had with transplantation.
Perhaps some more constructive use of our time could be spent at researching corals that do survive, like in areas known as
refugia. Refugia are areas on the reef that are seemingly, well resistant to bleaching. See, when coral reefs experience
bleaching, it’s rarely a case of the whole reef being affected. There are almost always pockets of coral on the reefs that
remain unaffected. And these are often the lower areas of the reef, those located in deeper water, where temperatures are
lower.
Now, we have evidence that corals in these locations are able to escape the destructive bleaching that affects portions of the
reef in shallower or warmer water. So in my mind, it’s these refugia that are the key components of overall reef resilience.
These should be the area of concentration for researchers to locate and protect those regions as a way to sustain coral reefs. And we can also protect the reefs by protecting the surrounding ecosystems, like mangrove forests and seagrass beds. Both
of these grow in coastal waters, often in the vicinity of coral reefs. By protecting these areas, we also protect the coral. Let’s
take, for example, the mangrove forests. Mangrove root systems have the ability to absorb and well trap sediments and
pollutants in water that flows through them before they enter the ocean. This of course has beneficial results for the nearby
coral reefs.
And fishery’s management is another key strategy. Overfishing can be seriously disruptive to coral. Let me give you a
238couple of examples. Overfishing certain species of fish and shellfish like snappers, barracudas and even lobsters. Well all of
these creatures feed on snails, worms and other organisms that eat coral. So depleting the number of lobsters, for example,
means that we are adding to the threat of coral decline. Sea urchins are another example. They eat algae and prevent it fromoverwhelming the coral. Since the disappearance of sea urchins from the waters up the coast of South Florida, many coral
reefs there have been smothered by the uncontrolled growth of algae.
239Lecture2-History of Musical Instruments (Violins)
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a history of musical instruments class.
Professor
So musical instruments evolved in ways that optimize their acoustical properties, how the instrument vibrates and sends
those vibration through the air to our eardrums.
Now professional musicians are very particular about their instruments, they want instruments that help them fully express
the intent of the composer, which of course translates into a more enjoyable listening experience for the audience members.
Yet most audience members probably aren’t even aware of how much the instrument matters. I mean, OK. Think about the
last concert you attended. When you applauded, what went through your mind?
Student
I recently heard a violinist who totally blew me away. So when I applauded, I guess I was showing my appreciation for his
skill, the hours of practicing he must have put in.
Professor
And his violin?
Student
Didn’t really think about it. It looked exactly like mine, which is inspiring in a way knowing my violin could also produce
beautiful tones, that maybe I would sound that good someday.
Professor
I hope you do. But if your violin isn’t as good as his…
Student
You mean he might not sound as good playing my violin?
Professor
As I said, tone quality differs from instrument to instrument. The question is why. Why does one instrument sound more
beautiful than another, even if they look identical?
There’s a particularly interesting case with an extraordinary generation of violins made in Northern Italy, in the city of
Cremona, back in the late 1600s - early 1700s. These vintage Cremonese violins are considered the best in the world. But
240it’s not like the makers of those violins were any more skilled than their modern-day counterparts. They weren’t. Today’s
top violin makers can pretty much replicate all the physical attributes of a Cremonese violin. But it’s generally thought that
the acoustical quality of modern violins doesn’t live up to the quality of the vintage ones.
Student
So what attributes of the old violins have been replicated?
Professor
Oh, their dimensions, shape, their fingerboard height, uh, general craftsmanship. For a long time, people thought the varnish
used to coat and protect the violins was special. But research showed it was the same ordinary varnish used on furniture.
However, researchers have discovered that there are something special about the wood the violins were made from. And
recently they have been able to replicate that too.
Student
How? Unless the trees that Cremonese used are still alive.
241Professor
The trees weren’t replicated, just the wood, specifically the wood’s density. Density is determined by how trees grow. Trees,
old trees that don’t grow in the tropics grow seasonally, they grow faster early in the year in the springtime than they do
later in the year. So early growth wood is relatively porous. Late growth wood is denser, less porous. And this variation
shows up in the trees growth rings. The denser layers are generally darker than the less dense layers. We call this variation
the density differential. Variations in wood density affect vibrations, and therefore, sound. When scientists first analyzed the
wood of vintage Cremonese violins in compared with the modern violin wood, they calculated the average density and
found no difference. Later, other researchers measured the density differential and found a significant difference. Modern
violins had a greater variation, a larger differential.
Student
So you mean the density of the wood in the Cremonese violins is, is more uniform?
Professor
Correct.
Student
But Northern Italy isn’t in the tropics.
Professor
No. But climate matters. Turns out the Cremonese violins were made from trees that grew during a Little Ice Age, a period
when temperatures across Europe were significantly lower than normal. So the trees grew more evenly throughout the year,
making the density differential relatively small.
Student
But you said someone replicated the Cremonese wood.
Professor
The density differential was replicated.
Student
What did they do? Try to simulate an Ice Age climate in their greenhouse and grow some trees in there?
Professor
No, what happened was a material scientist figured out a way to process wood to make it acoustically similar to the
Cremonese wood. He basically exposed the wood to a species of fungus, uh, a mushroom. In the forest, fungi are
decomposers. They break down dead wood. But this particular fungus nibbles away only at certain layers in the wood,
leaving other layers alone. As a result, the density differential of the fungi-treated wood approach that of the Cremonese
wood.
242Section2
Conversation2-Hydroponics (Chinampas)
Narrator
Listen to part of a conversation between a student and the professor of his history of technology class.
Student
Would it be okay to focus on something related to agriculture?
Professor
Sure, farming technology is fine, as long as it’s pre-modern. But this isn’t a long paper, so are you going to need to pick a
specific area of pre-modern agriculture, like irrigation or food crops of ancient Greece.
Student
I am actually interested in hydroponics.
Professor
Hydroponics. Growing plants in water instead of soil.
Student
Well, not in pure water, in water that has the proper mix of nutrients.
Professor
OK. But is it a pre-modern technology? I mean, hydroponics isn’t really my specialty but from the research I have read, we
are talking the nineteenth century, maybe the seventeenth century if you really stretch it.
Student
Oh? But the Aztec civilization back in the thirteenth century in basically where Mexico city is today … An article I read
said the Aztecs were using hydroponics in something they called … I have got the word right here. Um. Chinampas.
Professor
Chinampas, the so-called floating gardens.
Student
Exactly. So yeah the chinampas, the article said very clearly these floating gardens are proof that the Aztec invented
hydroponic farming.
Professor
Well, chinampas are artificial islands built up in shallow lakes. Islands made from packed earth and weeds and uh, material
from the bottom of the lake. They may have appeared to be floating in the water, but in fact they reach all the way to the
bottom of the lake. So the primary growing medium, what the plants draw nutrients from, is actually soil, not water.
Student
So the article was wrong about that? Too bad, it seems like a great topic, but I guess…
243Professor
Wait a minute. Just because chinampas were not technically hydroponic doesn’t mean this couldn’t be an appropriate topic
for your paper. Chinampas were still a great technological achievement. I mean, they enabled the Aztecs to grow plenty of
food in an area without much available farmland.
Student
But I wondered why the author wrote that chinampas were hydroponic.
Professor
Well it’s pretty common for writers to generalize, say use a term like hydroponics to describe other types of agriculture.
Personally, I would never say hydroponic except for plants growing in liquid. The crops on chinampas definitely benefited
from the water surrounding them. But… hydroponic…
Student
OK. So I will go with chinampas but leave out with the hydroponics part.
Professor
Actually, there’s an important lesson here. We should pay attention to what happened in history but also how historical
events are presented. Why, for example, would writers use a word like hydroponics so casually?
Student
I guess ‘cause it’s a popular topic people want to read about?
Professor
Or to help modern-day readers to understand something historical, maybe these writers think a familiar frame of reference is
needed.
Student
Well that article was in a popular magazine, not a scholarly journal for historians.
Professor
OK. But historians sometimes do the same thing.
Student
So I guess then that all historians might not describe chinampas in quite the same way either.
Professor
Good point. Why not look into that too? And include it along with your description and analysis.
244Lecture3-Zoology (Sauropods)
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a zoology class.
Professor
Your reading for today touched on dinosaur fossils from the Mesozoic era, which ended about 65 million years ago. Today
we will be discussing the sauropods. I think our discussion of sauropods will illustrate what we can learn by comparing the
fossil record to modern animals. By fossils, we mean traces of prehistoric animals such as bones, which become mineralized,
or impressions of bones or organs that are left in stone.
Now sauropods were among the largest animals to exist ever! They were larger than blue whales, which are the largest
animals alive today. They weigh up to one hundred tons, twenty times as much as elephants. Also, they were an extremely
successful kind of dinosaur. There’s evidence of sauropods in the fossil record for an unusually long time, over one hundred
million years.
So, why were sauropods so successful?
Biologically speaking, sauropods shouldn’t have been successful. Large animals like elephants, say, they require much more
food and energy and have fewer offspring than smaller animals. This makes maintaining a population harder. The largest
animals today don’t live on land. But in the ocean where food is easier to find, a blue whale, for instance, can eat up to
8,000 pounds of food a day. And they give birth only once every few years. We also know that body heat, that… well, large
animals can’t easily get rid of excess body heat. But for an oceangoing whale, that’s not a problem. For a 100-ton land
animal, it can be.
For years, we have assumed it was the abundant plant life of the Mesozoic that allowed these giants to thrive. However, we
now know that since oxygen levels were much lower in the Mesozoic than we assumed, there was much less plant life for
sauropods to eat than we thought.
So now, well, we are looking at other… we are, we are trying to understand the biology of sauropods, comparing their
fossils to the anatomy of modern animals to get a better idea of how they lived. What we’ve found is that sauropods were
experts at conserving energy. They had enormous stomach capacity, the ability to digest food over a long period, converting
it to energy at a slower pace, saving it for later. For animals with small stomachs, it takes lots of energy to constantly look
for food and then digest it. With larger stomachs and slower digestion, you don’t need as much energy. Joseph?
Student
Does… do scientists actually know about sauropods from looking at… I mean, how much can we actually learn looking at
some ancient bones compared to all we can learn from modern animals? And, comparisons between animals that lived
millions of years apart? well, it just seems… more like guessing.
Professor
245There’s always some guesswork when studying extinct animals. But that’s exactly what leads to discoveries, a hypothesis, a
type of guess is made. We guess the hypothesis by looking for evidence to support it. Then some questions are answered,
which may lead to new questions. For example, let’s look at one of these comparisons.
We know sauropods couldn’t chew food. Their skulls show they had no chewing muscles. Lots of modern animals, like
birds and reptiles, also can’t chew food. They need to swallow it whole. But modern animals have an interesting aid for
digesting food. They swallow stones, stones that are used to help grind up the food before it’s actually digested in the
stomach. These stones are called gastroliths. Gastroliths make food easier to digest, essentially smashing food up, just as we
do when we chew. Over time, gastroliths inside the animal are ground down and become smooth and rounded.
Now, sauropod fossils are commonly found with smooth stones. For years we thought these were gastroliths. They look just
like gastroliths and were found in the area of the sauropods’ stomachs. A recent study measured the gastroliths in modern
animals, in ostriches. And the study showed that ostriches need to ingest about one percent of their total body weight in
gastroliths. But we have been able to determine that the stones found with sauropods totaled much less proportionally, less
than a tenth of one percent of their body weight.
So now we are not quite sure what these sauropods’ stones were used for. It could be they were accidently ingested as the
sauropods foraged for food, that they served no real purpose. Other researchers speculate that sauropods ingested these
stones as a source of some the minerals they needed, such as calcium. So the original hypothesis that the stones found with sauropods were gastroliths, even though it hasn’t been supported, has
helped us to make new hypotheses, which may eventually lead to the answer.
246Lecture4-Studio Art (Primary Colors)
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a studio art class.
Professor
OK. As you probably know, primary colors are, theoretically speaking, the basic colors from which all other colors can be
made. But as you’ll find out when you start working on your painting projects, the three primary colors – red, blue, yellow –
don’t always make the best secondary colors. Combining red and blue, you will probably never get a fantastic violet. To get
a nice violet, you’ll have to add white. Combining yellow and blue, you will almost never get a satisfactory green. You are
better off using a pure green pigment.
The idea of primary colors, and specifically the idea of red, yellow and blue being THE primary colors, didn’t exist until
about 200 years ago. Until then, the dominant theory about color was one that had been proposed by Isaac Newton. Newton
gave a scientific and objective explanation of colors. He used a prism to break white light down into the various colors of
the spectrum. And he theorized, rightly so, that different colors are essentially different wavelengths of light. But he made
no mention of primary colors. That idea came from, or was at least published by a man named Johann Wolfgang von
Goethe.
Goethe was a well-known author. He wrote many famous novels, plays, poems. So why did he start thinking about colors?
Well Goethe was part of the Romantic Movement in western literature. And he was a Romantic, through and through,
meaning that he explained objects and phenomena in terms of the spiritual, emotional impact they had, as opposed to
explaining them in terms of their scientific nature. He rejected an objective understanding of color, in favor of a more
subjective understanding. He believed that when we see color, it stimulates our emotions. And different colors appeal to or
inspire different emotions in different people.
Student
That sounds like psychology.
Professor
Well, color theory is used in psychology too. Some psychologists do use their field’s version of color theory to diagnose and
treat patients. Um… anyway, Goethe conducted a number of experiments trying to figure out which colors corresponded to
which emotions. And in terms of that goal, he wasn’t very successful. But his experiments actually did show a lot about the
relationships between colors themselves, about how colors change when placed next to other colors, about how they interact
with one another. Scientists studying optics and chromatics today still marvel at his findings. But Goethe wasn’t really able
to establish a clear connection between colors and emotions.
Then in 1806, he received a letter from a relatively unknown German artist, a painter named Philipp Otto Runge. In the
247letter, Runge outlined his own color theory, specifically the connections he made between colors and emotions. And his
ideas about what colors symbolize, about the emotions that different colors inspire were based on the colors red, yellow and
blue. Runge’s choice of red, yellow and blue had nothing to do with what we know from modern-day chromatics, it had to
do with Runge’s complex system of symbolism, his experience of nature, particularly with his experience of the quality of
light at various times of the day, morning, noon and night. So each color had a specific symbolic value.
Well, four years later, Goethe published a book entitled Color Lesson. In Color Lesson, Goethe COINCIDENTLY cites the
same colors as primary colors. At this point, Goethe was already a well-known author, so he was easily able to popularize
this idea of primary colors, and specifically the idea of red, yellow and blue as THE primary colors.
Student
But he didn’t mention Runge?
Professor
Well, he did put Runge’s letter in the book, at the end. But he added a disclaimer implying that Runge’s letter didn’t
influence his work. Apparently, what Goethe was saying was that they just HAPPENED TO come up with the same theory
at the same time.

Section1
Conversation1
Narrator
Listen to part of a conversation between a student and a professor.
Student
I am so sorry I am late. Professor Mills. I just finished at the student medical center. I twisted my ankle playing soccer this
morning. It took longer than I expected to see the doctor.
Professor
That’s okay. Don’t worry about it. David. So let’s get started. Your paper on John Dewey’s political philosophy has a few
issues I’d like to cover. You gave a great biographical sketch in the beginning. Okay.
But then as you get into his political philosophy, I don’t think you’ve done enough to situate his philosophy within the time
period. In other words, you haven’t connected Dewey’s philosophy to the thinking of other intellectuals of the time.
248Student
So I haven’t captured the most critical influences, the influences that were most significant to his political thinking?
Professor
Exactly. OK. Now, look back up at the section here, where you wrote about Dewey’s view of individuality. This is all good
content. But you haven’t presented the information in a systematic way. I really think this portion on individuality needs to
come later, after your paragraphs on Dewey’s intellectual influences.
Student
After my revised paragraphs on what influenced them.
Professor
Yes. Revised. Let me ask. Uh. When you were finished writing, did you go back and ask yourself if all of the material was
relevant?
Student
Well, no.
Professor
I do think there are areas that can be cut. I guess what I am saying is that your paragraphs aren’t really presented in a logical
order. The direction of your argument isn’t crystal clear. And there’s some unnecessary material getting in the way.
Student
OK. Sounds like I have a lot to do.
Professor
And one more thing, do you have a copy of the department’s document on the correct format for index, citations and
references?
Student
No. I mean, I look at it online when I was working on this assignment.
Professor
You really should print it out. You are going to need it for every paper you write in the political science department. It looks
like you are getting it mix up with another referencing system.
Student
Oh. Yeah. I used something different in high school. It’s so confusing switching to a new system.
Professor
I know. But remember, everything needs to be consistent when it comes to referencing. It is a very important academic
convention.
Oh, also, I wanted to ask you… Will you be at the political science club meeting Saturday?
Student
Definitely. The topic is John Dewey.
249Professor
Yes. Are you interested in leading part of the discussion? Tom Hayward is looking for someone to help out. I think you’ll
have a lot to contribute.
Student
That’ll be fun. I will give him a call.
Lecture1-Philosophy
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a philosophy class.
Professor
Okay. So, uh, to continue our discussion… When philosophers talk about the basis of knowledge, they don’t mean the
source of information about any particular subject. They mean how we know what we know.
Let’s start with one philosophical view—foundationalism. Foundationalism is the view that our knowledge claims, what we think we know, that is, they need to have a base. And think
of knowledge as a house, you need a solid foundation on which to build your house. And if you have a strong foundation,
your house is more likely to be solid. Well, foundationalists think the same thing is true of knowledge. If you have a solid
base for your knowledge claims, then your knowledge structure is more likely to be strong, valid, true.
First, you need some good foundational knowledge claims, and then the rest of the knowledge claims can be based on these.
Now, as to what kinds of knowledge claims are foundational, well, that’s where this gets particularly interesting, in fact it
sort of depends on which philosopher you ask. Take John Locke for instance.
Locke’s viewpoint essentially was that when humans are born, their minds are like blank slates, that is, we don’t have any
kind of knowledge when we are born. We get our knowledge from our senses, you know, taste, touch, smell, sight, hearing.
So, when we look at the world, first as babies and then as we grow, that’s where our knowledge comes from. Our senses,
our experiences serve as the foundation for our knowledge.
Now, for a very different view, let’s turn to another philosopher—René Descartes. Descartes thought that you have to go much deeper to find the foundations. He believed that our senses are not to be trusted.
So he wanted to find a more solid foundation for knowledge. He began with what has come to be called methodological
doubt. And when we say methodological doubt, well … Descartes believed that everything should be questioned, that is,
approach it with doubt and that if you could find one thing that cannot be false, that one thing would serve as a foundation
for all other knowledge claims.
So unlike John Locke, Descartes doubts that knowledge comes to him from his senses. He points out that at some time or
another, everyone has been deceived by their senses. We have all had experiences where our senses have been
wrong—illusions, perhaps, mirages. When driving in a car on a hot summer day, you may see what looks like shimmering
water on the road, which, as science tells us, is really just a mirage, an illusion caused by the heating of the air. Our senses
are wrong, they’ve deceived us. And Descartes thinks that since our senses can deceive us, we ought not take for granted
that what they tell us is really true. That’s the first step in his methodological doubt.
From there he wonders, well, ok, I can doubt my senses, but can I doubt that I am sitting in this room? Can it seem that we
250are not really here? That we are somewhere else? He conceives that most of us would know that we are sitting in the room.
But then he says, well, couldn’t I just be dreaming? He’s had dreams that were so real that he thought he was awake when in
fact he was actually asleep. And this is another good point. It’s really hard to be sure that you are not actually dreaming. Yet
another proof for Descartes that we can’t always trust what our senses are apparently telling us. We could be dreaming. And
there’s really no good way to prove that we are not.
So the common sense picture of reality, that the world is really the way it looks to us, Descartes shows that we cannot just
assume this to be true beyond all doubt. And he does this by talking about illusions and also by arguing that we could be
dreaming. But consider this, he says, while one is thinking or doubting, or doing any of those sorts of mental activities, one
has to exist, right? To even think that I doubt that I exist, you have to exist! And so what Descartes has done is find at least
one thing that he can be certain of. He says, “I exist.” And that’s a start. And other knowledge he tells us can be based on
that foundation.
251Lecture2-Animal Behavior
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an animal behavior class.
Professor
As you know, researchers have long been interested in discovering exactly how intelligent animals are. Today we are going
to talk about a particular cognitive ability some animals seem to have—the ability to recognize themselves in a mirror. Student
Oh. I’ve heard about that. Chimpanzees have it.
Professor
Right. Chimpanzees and other primates, chimps, gorillas, orangutans, and of course, humans. But it’s also been found in
elephants and bottlenose dolphins, a bit of a surprise. It’s very rare. Most animals don’t have it. And it’s called mirror
self-recognition, or MSR.
Student
Well, how does it work? I mean, how do researchers know if elephants or chimps recognize themselves?
Professor
Researchers give them a mirror mark test. In the mirror mark test, researchers put a mark on the animal where the animal is
unable to see it or smell it or feel it, like on the side of their head, without looking in the mirror.
Now, typically, when animals first see themselves in the mirror, they think they are seeing another animal. Often they will
look for this animal behind the mirror. They may even exhibit aggressive behavior.
But some animals, after this period of exploration, exhibit behaviors that show they know they are looking at themselves.
For instance, elephants will touch the mark on their heads with their trunks.
Now, it’s been assumed that primates and some other mammals stood alone at the top of the hierarchy of cognitive
evolution. But recently, birds have been found to possess some of the same cognitive abilities! In particular, researchers
have discovered these abilities in corvids, birds of the corvidae family.
Corvids include ravens, jays, crows and magpies among others. And what kinds of cognitive abilities are we talking about?
Well, corvids and some mammals have the ability to plan for the future, to store food for instance, in places where they can
find it later. It’s been suggested in fact that jays, corvids known for stealing each other’s food, may hide their food precisely
because they are projecting their own tendency to steal onto other jays.
So let’s talk about a study recently conducted with magpies. As I said, magpies are corvids. And because corvids have these
other cognitive skills, researchers wanted to see if they were also capable of mirror self-recognition. So they gave them the
mirror mark test, placing yellow sticker on the birds’ black throat feathers. At first, the magpies all engage in the same social
behaviors that other animals do—looking behind the mirror, etc. But eventually, some of the birds, while looking in the
mirror, kept scratching at the mark until they got rid of it. And they didn’t scratch at it when there was no mirror around. So
they passed the test.
252Student
Wow! Do any other birds have this ability?
Professor
Well, not that we know of. There was a study using pigeons, where researchers attempted to reduce MSR to a matter of
conditioning, that is, they claimed that the ability to recognize oneself in a mirror could be learned. So these researchers
basically trained some pigeons to pass the mirror mark test.
But two things are noteworthy here. One, no one’s ever replicated the study. But more importantly, it misses the point. The
issue isn’t whether some behavior can be learned. It’s whether a species has developed this ability spontaneously.
Student
So what does the test tell us about corvids or chimpanzees?
Professor
Good question. For one thing, it is important because it sets animals with a sense of self apart from those without a sense of
self. But more importantly, many researchers believe that MSR is indicative of other advanced cognitive abilities.
Self-awareness, even in its earliest stages, might entail an awareness of others, the ability to see their perspective, to look at
the world from another’s point of view. This is crucial, because it implies a high level of cognitive development. It’s perhaps
the first stage toward the development of empathy.
Student
But birds’ brains are so small compared to primates.
Professor
True. Though corvids do have unusually large brains for birds. But size isn’t the whole story. It’s thought that primates are
so intelligent because of a certain part of their brains, which birds simply don’t have. But there is an area in birds’ brains
that researchers believe governs similar cognitive functions.
So primates and birds’ brains have evolved along different tracks, but ended up with similar abilities.
253Section2
Conversation2
Narrator
Listen to part of a conversation between a student and a professor.
Student
Hi. Sorry. I’m late. Professor Blane.
Professor
No problem. Jim. So you’ve got some questions about your senior thesis requirement?
Student
Yeah. I’ve got a couple of problems actually. So, the first thing is, you normally write it during the first half of the academic
year. Right? In your final year of studies.
Professor
Right.
Student
But I have my student teaching scheduled for that time. I want to teach high school English after graduation. So I really
need to give that my full attention. And I just worry that I won’t be able to if I am writing my senior thesis at the same time.
I mean, it’s supposed to be 35 to 40 pages. That’s a serious commitment.
Professor
You are right. But it really isn’t a problem.
Student
Really?
Professor
No. A lot of English majors get teacher certification, so we have students like you do their senior thesis after their student
teaching. It works out well, because many students want to use a unit they taught as the basis of their paper. So you’ll just
enroll in a thesis seminar for the second semester.
Student
Well, that’s a big relief. But it brings us to my second problem. I’d really focus my studies on old and middle English
literature. I am even thinking about doing a graduate degree with a concentration in that after I taught for a while. So I was
hoping to do my senior thesis on Chaucer, on The Canterbury Tales, because that would obviously be useful if I do go on.
But …
Professor
Ah. But Professor Johnson …
254Student
Exactly. Professor John is going to be taking a sabbatical to do research in France during the second half of the year. So
without him around, I am not sure how I could do a senior thesis on The Canterbury Tales. I mean, the focus of his teaching
and research is unique around here.
Professor
Yes. I understand. It would be difficult to do your paper without professor Johnson around. Hmmm… would you allow me
to try to sell you on an alternate plan?
Student
Well, you can try. But Chaucer is sort of my hero, if you know what I mean.
Professor
Well, I am teaching a course on the literature of the Renaissance in the first half of the year. It’ll meet late in the day, so it
won’t interfere with your teaching. And I haven’t offered it in quite a while now, so I doubt you ever studied that period on
the college level.
Student
No. I haven’t.
Professor
If you would be interested in taking the course, I’d be happy to give you supplemental readings, and I’d also be happy to be
your advisor for your paper later on.
Student
Well, I never looked at that area before, but I have always had an interest in it. So that does have a certain appeal.
Professor
Well, if you do decide to go this route, I would make that decision soon and I would use this summer productively. After all,
this is not going to be like taking an intro course.
255Lecture3-Botany
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a botany class.
Professor
OK. Last time we talked about photosynthesis, the process by which plants use light to convert carbon dioxide and water
into food. Today I want to talk about another way light affects plants. I am sure you all know from physics class about how
light moves in microscopic ways and that we can only see light when the wavelength of that light is in a specific range. Plus, depending on the wavelengths, we see different colors.
Well, plants are also capable of distinguishing between different wavelengths of light. Now, I don’t want to confuse you. It
is not like plants have eyes. Plants don’t see in the sense that humans or animals do, but they do have photoreceptors. Photoreceptors are cells that respond to light by sending out a chemical signal. And the organism, the plant, reacts to this
signal. In fact, the signals that plants get from their photoreceptors sometimes cause significant reactions.
And many plants are seasonal. And one way they know when winter is ending and spring is beginning is by sensing the
change in light. The time when an adult plant flowers is based on the amount of light the plant senses. Certain plant species
won’t flower if they sense too much light and some plants will only flower if they sense a specific amount of light. Of
course, these aren’t conscious reactions. These plants just automatically respond to light in certain ways.
Plants are also able to distinguish between specific wavelengths of light that the human eye cannot even see! Specifically
there’s a wavelength called far-red. Although why they call it far-red … I mean, it is not red at all. It lies in the infrared
range of the spectrum. We can’t see it, but plants can sense it as a different wavelength.
OK. Now I need to mention another thing about photosynthesis. I didn’t explain how different wavelengths of light affect
photosynthesis. When a plant absorbs light for performing photosynthesis, it only absorbs some wavelengths of light and
reflects others. Plants absorb most of the red light that hits them, but plants only absorb some of the far-red light that hits
them. They reflect the rest. Remember this, because it’s going to be relevant in an experiment I want to discuss.
This fascinating experiment showed that plants not only detect and react to specific wavelengths of light, plants can also
detect and react to changes in the ratio of one wavelength to another. This experiment was called the Pampas experiment.
The idea behind the Pampas experiment had to do with the response of plants to changes in the ratio of red light to far-red
light that the plants sense with their photoreceptors. Some biologists hypothesize that a plant will stop growing if it’s in the
shade of another plant, a reaction that’s triggered when it senses an unusual ratio of red light to far-red light. OK.
Imagine there are two plants. One below the other. The plant on top would absorb most of the red light for photosynthesis,
but reflect most of the far-red light. That would lead to the plant in its shade sensing an unusual ratio. There will be less red
light and more far-red light than normal.
What that ratio signifies is important. A ratio of less red and to more far-red light would cause a reaction from the plant. It
would stop growing taller, because that plant would sense that it wasn’t going to get enough sunlight to provide the energy
to grow large.
256To test their hypothesis, researchers took some electrical lights, um… actually, they were light-emitting diodes, or LEDs.
These light-emitting diodes could simulate red light. So they put these LEDs around some plants that were in the shade. The
LEDs produce light that the plants sensed as red. But, unlike sunlight, the light from these LEDs did not support
photosynthesis. So the plants sensed the proper ratio of red light to far-red light and reacted by continuing to grow taller,
while in reality these plants were not getting enough energy from photosynthesis to support all of that growth. And because
they weren’t getting enough energy to support their growth, most of the shaded plants died after a short time.
257Lecture4-Archaeology
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an archaeology class.
Professor
It’s every archaeologist’s dream to find a lost civilization, to make some huge discovery, to find artifacts no one else has laid
a hand on in millennia. You might think that this never happens any more, given all the research in archaeology that’s been
done. But in the late twentieth century, archaeologists discovered the remains of a sophisticated people whose settlement
might have been the hub of a civilization few people even thought existed.
They found this site at the edge of a desert in Turkmenistan, in central Asia, where a series of mounds rise up from the
plains. Now, you might remember because we’ve talked about this, archaeologists know that mounds such as these are the
kinds of geological features that indicate the presence of ancient settlements. Jim?
Student
Um…mounds can be different things, right? Some are burial places…
Professor
Exactly. And some are the remains of cities. The inhabitants would build houses and temples you know, what have you. And
over time, those buildings would fall down or be torn down and then be built over. Over time, generations of building and
rebuilding in the same area would result in a large hill the size of a city. Careful excavation and documentation of layers in a
mound can reveal a wealth of information about the everyday life of a people in a settlement over many periods of
occupation.
Now, this particular site is called Gonur-depe. What was found at Gonur-depe was amazing: the ruins of a huge palace
complex, the foundations of shops and houses, the remains of thick walls and towers that fortified the city. There was even
an elaborate canal system and a lot of very intricate jewelry. All these findings seem to indicate that they are the remains of
an ancient civilization that was every bit as advanced as other more famous civilizations of the time. Like those in Egypt, or,
or China. And the site dates back to 3,000 B.C.E.
Student
Did they trade with those other civilizations? Because if they did, wouldn’t there’ve been some evidence of that? You know,
an artifact found in the ruins of other civilizations?
Professor
That’s a good question. I mentioned Jewelry, well, Jewelry have been found in Mesopotamia and at archaeological sites in
modern-day Pakistan. But archaeologists didn’t know where it came from. Only after the site at Gonur-depe was excavated
were archaeologists able to identify it as coming from Gonur-depe. Uh, Sheryl?
Student
I wonder why nobody found this site before.
Professor
Well, before the discovery of this site, it was commonly believed that central Asia had always been occupied by mostly
258nomadic people. So there would be no record of major settlements. A couple of small finds have been made in the area, but
really, no one had looked very hard.
Now, one mystery regarding this site is that archaeological records show it was inhabited for only a few centuries.
Student
What happened to the people who lived there?
Professor
Well, the site was close to the Murgab river, which they would have depended on for their water. And the Murgab river,
which runs toward the west, is the kind of river that shifts its course over time. So one theory is that the river’s course
shifted toward the South, and they simply followed it and built new towns to the South.
Another theory is that they were involved in wars with neighboring settlements. But we might never know the truth.
One thing we do know is that in the decades since Gonur-depe was discovered, the site has deteriorated significantly. I mean,
it’s been disturbed for the first time in millennia. And being exposed to the Sun and wind has taken its toll on the ancient
city.
So now the question is, do we partially restore and rebuild the site before the entire thing disintegrates? It will take a lot of
funding to restore it and I am not sure it’ll be made available, which would be a pity. Even a partly altered site can provide
valuable information, which would be lost otherwise.

Listen to part of a conversation between a student and an employee at the registrar’s office.
Employee
Morning. How can I help you?
Student
Well, I am kind of confused about my schedule. I printed it out this morning. But one of the classes I registered for is
missing.
Employee
OK. Let’s see if we can figure this out. What’s your name?
Student
Lisa Johnson.
Employee
259Alright. I am bringing up your schedule on the computer. Hmmm…It looks like you’re registered for Introduction to
Astronomy, Survey of American Literature, and Introduction to Government and Politics.
Student
Well, yes, but I also registered for a language class—Level One Japanese. Did they…I don’t know, maybe cancel it?
Employee
I doubt it. The Japanese classes are quite popular. But let’s take a look at the list of Japanese classes being offered this
semester just to make sure. Um… what section did you register for?
Student
I don’t remember the section number. But it’s the one that meets at eleven.
Employee
Ah! That would be section five. Well, according to this, the class is completely full. Are you sure…you, um, you registered
online, right?
Student
Yeah.
Employee
Did you get a confirmation message?
Student
What do you mean?
Employee
Well, once you’ve successfully registered for a class, the computer gives you a message saying you are in.
Student
Oh. You mean that message at the bottom of the screen that says you’re now registered for this class? Actually, I didn’t get
that message. I got one that said “instructor’s signature required.” I thought I just needed to get to professor’s signature on
the first day of class.
Employee
Well, you do. But the professor might no sign it. It depends on how full the class is and how many additional students the
professor is willing to let in.
Student
So that means I am not registered for the class. Not unless the professor signs me in. What, uh, what should I do now?
Employee
Let me give you the form the professor needs to sign. Go to the class on the first day, get there early, so you can talk to the
professor before class starts. Find out if he or she is willing to let you in. If so, bring the signed form back here and we’ll
register you for the class.
If not, well, you’ll have to find a different class. I’d start looking for alternatives now, just in case.
Student
260What do you think my chances are of getting into this class?
Employee
Students often add and drop classes once the semester begins, so there is a real chance a seat would open up. But of course
there are no guarantees.
Student
It’s just that I need a language course to graduate and that’s the only Japanese class that fits my schedule.
Employee
Yes. But according to our records, you are only in your first year here. If you can’t take the class this semester, you still got
time.
Student
I know. I was just hoping to take care of my requirements earlier rather than later.
Employee
I understand. I just wanted to make sure you know you had options.
261Lecture1-Ecology(Pedodiversity)
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a plant ecology class.
Professor
So far we have covered biodiversity in the hard wood forest here in the upper peninsula of Michigan from a number of
angles. We’ve looked at everything from how biodiversity relates to species stability, to competition for forests resources
and more.
But now I want to discuss what’s called pedodiversity. Pedodiversity is basically soil diversity. When we analyze
pedodiversity within an area, we are measuring how much variability there is in soil properties and how many different
types of soil there are in a particular area.
So we look at soil chemistry. For example, how much nitrogen or magnesium there’s in the soil in one spot. And we
compare it with the chemistry of the soil a short distance away.
Until recently, there hasn’t been a whole lot of attention paid to pedodiversity. But that’s changing rapidly. More and more
studies are being done in these fields. There’s a link between biodiversity and pedodiversity, an obvious relationship
between soils and flora and fauna, which is why pedodiversity really should be considered in forest management.
A high degree of soil variability in a small area is common, particularly within forests. If you compare soils from a forest
with soils that don’t come from a forest, the amount of variability will most likely be greater in the forest’s soil. It generally
has more diversity.
Um…OK. There are three main causes of pedodiversity within old-growth forest here in our region of Michigan.
One is tree species. Different species have different influences on soil formation and soil properties. For example, pine trees
drop pine needles. And those needles add a lot of acid to the soil. The organic litter of another tree species might add less
acid but more of something else. A lot of different types of trees in an area might mean more pedodiversity.
Another cause? Gaps … created when trees fall. You see, where there are gaps, open areas in the forest, the soil there
changes. Um… for instance, without a tree to absorb radiation from the Sun, to offer shade, the full intensity of that
radiation reaches the ground. The soil where the tree used to be heats up. And without a tree to soak up moisture from the
ground, the soil remains wetter than in the surrounding forest. With a higher temperature and more moist conditions, the
process of organic matter decomposition speeds up. In other words, organic matter gets broken down and added into the soil
more quickly in these gaps than in the surrounding forest.
OK. And the third cause—trees being uprooted. When a tree is uprooted, it might fall into some other trees on its way down,
thus falling only partway over. Or it might crash all the way down to the forest floor. Either way, if its roots are pulled up
from out of the ground as the tree topples over, then there’s usually a big hole, a pit left in the ground where the roots used
to be. And there’s still a lot of soil attached to the roots, clinging to the roots. As that soil is eventually shed from the roots
by rain and wind and the movement of squirrels climbing around, things like that. Um... as the soil is shed, it drops down
and forms a little hill of dirt, a mound.
Pits and mounds have significantly different soil properties than other areas in the forest. You get a redistribution and
262mixing of soil as deep roots are ripped up from the ground. Rock fragments can be pulled up too, if they’ve gotten entangled
with the roots over the years. So rock fragments from the subsoil can end up concentrated on the surface.
There are forests management implications I want to point out. Forests management impacts soil quality. And when we
better understand pedodiversity, we will be better able to predict the impact of forest management on soil. But in general,
for positive impact, forest management practices should mimic natural forest processes. And the goal should be to promote
pedodiversity, and through this, biodiversity in general.
I have a handout, an article on pedodiversity in a section of forests near here. I want you to read it, because it makes a point
that I’ve only touched on. From what I have been saying about the causes of pedodiversity, you might assume that the
relationship between forest dynamics, what happens to the trees, and pedodiversity is a one-way street. As the article
explains, forest dynamics affects pedodiversity. But pedodiversity also affects forest dynamics. It’s worth bearing in mind.
263Lecture2-Architecture(Reverberation)
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an architecture class.
Professor
Today I’d like to talk a bit about the relationship between the built world and sound. Uh, the design of buildings like concert
halls or theaters. So, what’s the most important aspect in the design of such a building?
Student
Acoustics?
Professor
Yes. Now, people have been concerned about how sound carries in auditoriums and theaters for at least 2,000 years. But it
was not until the beginning of the twentieth century that architectural acoustics became a scientific field. That was when the
physicist Wallace Sabine started to do extensive studies on reverberation. Sabine wanted to find out why the audience could not understand speakers at a lecture hall in Boston. He designed a series
of studies on reverberation to figure it out. So, what is reverberation? It’s the persistence of sound in a room after the source
has stopped making sound. You see, sound made in a room reflects off the walls, floors and ceiling. That’s the reverberant
sound. The time it takes for the reverberant sound to die down is important for the acoustic quality of a room. Sabine
recognized this and he came up with an equation to measure a room’s reverberation time.
So, what happens if the reverberation time is very long?
Student
Wouldn’t it be difficult to hear new sounds if you can still hear the old sounds?
Professor
Exactly. A long reverberation time may cause musical notes to drown one another out.
On the other hand, if the reverberation time is very short … meaning, the reverberations are absorbed very quickly, the roomis called dead. Performers would feel they have to struggle to fill the room with sound. We don’t want that. In a concert hall
or theater, we prefer a live room, where the sound has fullness.
So we need to control the reverberation time. After all, we don’t want the listeners or the performers have to struggle, right?
So what are some important considerations when we design a theater or a concert hall?
Student
The size of the place?
Professor
Absolutely. The larger the room, the longer the reverberation time. So we’ll have to take into account what the room will be
mainly used for, since music requires more reverberation than speech. A room intended for music needs to be designed
264differently from a room intended for drama. For music, we need a very large room, a concert hall, actually I should say for
full orchestras. Because for a single instrument, say something like a piano recital, a room with a short reverberation time is
better. So for a solo piano a smaller room works well. Yes?
Student
I read that concert halls designed for symphony orchestras have too much echo for jazz music.
Professor
That doesn’t surprise me. Most small jazz groups would need rooms with a shorter reverberation time.
But besides the size of the room, another variable affecting reverberation is the shape of the room. Let’s say you design a
rectangular box-like space with bare walls and ceiling, this would allow the sound to act like a ball in a racquetball court,
you know, bouncing around and hitting some parts of the walls and ceiling but missing many others. If that happens in a
concert hall, audience members may hear some sounds, but not others.
So what can be done to distribute the sound evenly in every direction? The answer is: avoid straight, parallel walls.
Karen?
Student
But I think I’ve seen photos of rectangular concert halls.
Professor
Right. Older concert halls from the 1800s are generally rectangular. But they all have a lot of decorations on the walls inside,
lots of ornamental plasterwork like statues, which distribute sound very efficiently, reflecting it in all different directions.
And that brings me to another variable we need to consider. The acoustic characteristics of the building materials as well as
the wall and floor coverings. In fact, most objects you see in a concert hall or theater serve double duty. The plush chairs
absorb sound and soften reverberation. And the beautiful crystal Chandeliers? They are very good at diffusing sound. You
see, everything must be planned down to the last detail in order to predict the acoustic performance of a room.
That being said, there’s something that can’t be controlled by the architect. The audience has an effect on acoustics too. The
heads of people are good diffusers of sound. And Architects try to account for this effect in their design, but they can’t
guarantee a full auditorium.
265Section2
Conversation2
Narrator
Listen to a conversation between a student and his music history professor.
Student
Um, professor Jenkins. The listening journal you assigned us to keep for the Intro to World Music class, well, I am not sure
I understand what to do. I listened to the pieces you assigned this week more than once, but when I tried to write about them, I didn’t know what to say.
Professor
Well, it’s not easy to write about music, even for people who are supposedly expert at it.
Student
That makes me feel a little better. But I am just not familiar with how you keep a listening journal. I’ve kept journals for
other classes, summarizing and writing about how I felt about readings.
Professor
Well, a listening journal isn’t all that different, I want you to note your feelings about musical compositions too.
Student
OK. There were pieces I like more than others, but I think you want our comments to be a little more…I don’t know,
analytical. Right?
Professor
Well, whether you like a piece or not is important, but you should be able to explain why you like a particular piece and be
able to talk about its historical and musical context. Actually, the listening journal is a tool to help you listen to music
actively, to think about what you are hearing.
Student
Maybe I am finding it difficult because I am not real familiar with most of the music you assigned. I mean, if it’s hip-hop or
something I listen to with my friends…
Professor
Yes, because hip-hop is a form that’s familiar and meaningful to you. But you’ll see as the semester progresses and you start
learning more about musical forms, you’ll become a more adept listener. And you’ll start noticing patterns.
Student
OK. So the songs we listened to this week, the …the Canto?
Professor
The Cante jondo1. You remember we said it means “deep song” in Andalusian Spanish? Not only because it’s sung in a
1 Spanish hondo = "deep". The name is spelt with a j as a form of eye dialect because
traditional Andalusian pronunciation has retained an aspirated h lost in other forms of
Spanish.
266deep register, but also because it’s a song about deeper or serious matters, certainly not lighthearted.
Student
Really? Hmm…I guess I didn’t catch the double meaning. That’s kind of cool. But anyway, even with the translations you
gave us for the lyrics and everything, I don’t know, I could tell it’s sad, but I wasn’t trying to analyze it, from a musical
perspective that is.
Professor
OK. So this is what you should do. Go back and listen to the song selection and this time pay attention to the melody, to
repetition, to the …
Student
There was plenty of that. Some parts sounded like the same note played over and over again.
Professor
That’s exactly the kind of observation you would record in a listening journal. So, melody repetition, rhythm, how the piece
is structured, as well as your reasons for liking or disliking it.
You know what? I thought everyone was clear about this, but you’ve just given me a great idea. I am going to draw up a list
of questions everyone should keep in mind when they are writing their journals. Other students may be having the same
problem you are having.
267Lecture3-Archaeology(Clovis Culture)
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an archaeology class.
Professor
We will be looking at the original settlement of the Americas next, and I’ll spend the next few classes talking about the
Clovis people and the two big questions archaeologists have about them.
The two big questions are, when did the Clovis people arrive in the Americas? And of course, were they the first people in
the Western hemisphere. And we’ll get to that. But for today, let’s try to get an idea about, well, a question that’s not
addressed as much as the others and that’s – what was their culture like? And how do we figure that out?
Now, again, there’s a great debate about when the Clovis people first arrived in the Americas. And I am not like a lot of
archaeologists who want to push the number way back, so let’s use a round number and probably a safe number and say
11,000 years ago. The Clovis people were likely settling North America 11,000 years ago. And leave it at that for now.
Now, most of what we know about the Clovis people comes from one of their tools—the Clovis point. When we talk about
a point we are referring to a piece of stone that’s worked to a sharp point, in this case probably to be attached to a spear. The
Clovis point may be the most analyzed artifact in archaeology. And the point used by Clovis people differs slightly fromlater points, in the way that the base of the stone is thinned, uh, it’s thinner toward the base, the part that’s attached to the
spear. So when one is found, it’s usually not confused with points made by later groups.
Clovis points have been discovered at both hunting grounds and camp sites, which you might expect. But another
fascinating place we find them is in Clovis caches. A cache is just something stored or hidden away. It’s also the term for the
place where it’s hidden.
The Clovis caches are collections of tools, stone points and other tools made of stone or bone, often at various stages of
manufacturing, some were left unfinished. The traditional explanation is that these were emergency supplies, uh, meant to
be used at a later time. Since the Clovis people were highly mobile, it’s plausible that they would set up spots along
268established travel routes where they keep a variety of items. Either so that they wouldn’t have to carry everything with themor so they could save time once they arrived at a site by not having to make stuff from scratch.
But there’s another theory about the caches based on the quality of some of the points we’ve found. You see, the points in
some caches differ from other points, from points at Clovis camp sites for example. For one thing, these cache points are
quite large, up to twice as large as regular points, so big that you couldn’t attach one to a spear say, and expect to throw the
spear accurately over any distance. So what were they for?
Well, it was originally thought that they were unfinished, that someone was working away a point, then had to stop and put
it aside in one of these caches to work on later. The problem is: it’s unlikely that a point would have started out as large as
the points in these caches, that would be a lot of stone to chip away. A toolmaker starts with a smaller piece. And actually,
far from being unfinished, a lot of these points really show excellent craftsmanship and attention to detail. And not just with
respect to the skill, but also with respect to the raw material, it seems that cached points are made from the very best pieces
of stone.
So we have to ask—could these points have served another purpose? Maybe be they weren’t just tools. Look at it this way.
When the Clovis people first arrived in the Americas, they had a lot to learn about their new environment. Over time, they
would have begun to recognize some places as special, important for some reason. Maybe there was always water available
there. Or the hunting was especially good. So maybe the cache was a way to mark the place as significant.
269Lecture4-Structural Engineering(Carbon Nanotubes)
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a structural engineering class.
Professor
Today let’s begin to look at structural engineering in the Space Age. Uh, new problems…new possibilities mean we can
think in new ways, find radically different approaches. So let’s consider…uh, well, what would you say is the biggest
obstacle today to putting structures, equipment, people …uh, anything really, into space?
Student
Well, the cost, right?
Professor
Exactly. I mean, just taking the space shuttle up and back one time is hugely expensive. Uh, why?
Student
I guess a lot of it is for fuel, right? To…to get the rocket going fast enough.
Professor
OK. Fast enough to…
Student
To escape Earth’s gravity.
Professor
Good. So we are burning up an enormous amount of fuel at every launch just to get the rocket up to what’s known as escape
velocity. Now, escape velocity is around 11 kilometers a second, pretty fast. But do we really have to go this fast?
Student
Well, yeah. I mean, how else can you, um…escape? I mean, that’s the whole point of escape velocity, right? Otherwise
gravity will pull you back down to the Earth.
Professor
Actually, that’s a common misconception. Escape velocity is simply the speed of an object that’s …uh, let’s say, shot out of
a cannon the minimum initial speed so that the object could later escape Earth’s gravity on its own. But that’s just if there’s
no additional force being applied. If you keep on supplying force to the object, keep on pushing it upward. It could pull
away from Earth’s gravity at any speed.
Student
Even really slow? So you’re saying …like, if you had a ladder tall enough, you could just climb into space?
Professor
Yeah! Uh, well, theoretically. I mean, I can see some practical problems with the ladder example. Uh, like you might get
just a little bit tired out after the first few thousand kilometers or so, uh, especially with all the oxygen tanks you’ll have to
be hauling up with you.
270No. I was thinking more along the lines of an elevator.
Student
Wait! You are serious?
Professor
Sure. An elevator. That’s a new idea to most of us, but in fact it’s been around for over a century. If we could power such an
elevator with solar energy, we could simply rise up into space for a fraction of the cost of a trip by rocket or shuttle.
Student
But wait, elevators don’t just rise up. It have (sic2) to hang on some kind of wire or track or something.
Professor
Uh, true. And for decades that’s exactly what’s prevented the idea from being feasible or even just taken seriously. Where do
we find the material strong enough yet lightweight enough to act as a cable or track. I mean, we are talking 36,000
kilometers here. And the strain on the cable would be more than most materials could bear.
But a new material developed recently has a tensile strength higher than diamond, yet it’s much more flexible. I am talking
about carbon nanotubes. Student
OK. I’ve read something about carbon nanotubes. They are strong, alright, but aren’t they just very short little cylinders in
shape?
Professor
Ah, yes. But these cylinders cling together at a molecular level. You pull out one nanotube or row of nanotubes, and its
neighbor’s come with it, and their neighbors, and so on. So you could actually draw out a 36,000-kilometer strand or ribbon
of nanotubes stronger than steel, but maybe a thousandth the thickness of a human hair.
Student
OK. Fine. But what’s going to hold this ribbon up and keep it reach enough to support an elevator car?
Professor
Well, we definitely have to anchor it at both ends. So what we need is a really tall tower here on the ground right at the
equator and a satellite in geostationary orbit around the Earth. There’s a reason I mentioned that figure of 36,000 kilometers.
That’s about how high an object would have to be orbiting straight up from the equator to constantly remain directly above
the exact same spot on the rotating planet Earth. So once you are in this geostationary orbit right over the tower, just lower
your carbon nanotube cable down from the satellite, tether it to the tower here on Earth. And there you have it!
Student
So you really think this is a possibility? Like, how soon could it happen?
Professor
Well, the science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke talked about building a space elevator back in the 1970s. And when
someone asked him when he thought this idea might become a reality, his reply was, “Probably about fifty years after

Uh-huh. How can I help you?
Student
Well, I am stopping by to reserve a place for my school club that meet and work, pretty much on a regular basis. Ideally, our
preference would be to have our own office.
Employee
Hmm…well, we are out of private offices. But we do have some semi-private options still available.
Student
What do you mean?
Employee
Well, it’s a setup where you’ll have a larger workspace shared by two other clubs. In other words, each club would have its
own work area within that one room.
Student
Oh. Are there any divider, walls or anything?

Oh, yes. There will be a couple of dividers, so there’s some privacy.
Student
Um. We’ll work with that then. I wouldn’t want to be without an office.

Yeah, last week. That was my very first step.
Employee
Right. Well, for my purposes, a club definitely has to be registered before I can proceed further. At the moment, however, it
appears that there’s no record of your club’s registration.
Student
Really? I thought everything was finalized last week.
Employee
Well, it is surprising. Usually there’s a 24-hour turnaround in our computer database. So then do you have the registration
approval letter from the review committee? That would give me the verification I need.
Student
Yeah. I do. I mean, well, I don’t have it with me. But … I… I, uh, can get it from my dorm room, bring it back with me and
submit it with those forms you need from me.
Employee
Great! That’ll work. And just so you are aware, there’re lots of benefits to being registered.
Student
273Oh, yeah. I think the university will give us permission to set up a website, right? I want to get students sharing their ideas
on the website, you know, establish a photography blog.
Employee
Yes. You’ll be able to do that. And…um…actually there’s more. You’ll be allowed the use of audiovisual equipment at no
cost. You’ll receive a club mailbox and a club email address. You’ll be allowed to post your flyers and posters around the
campus for publicity. And you could be eligible for funding for club events.
Student
Well, we are definitely interested in hiring a professional speaker at one of our campus events at some point in the semester. And speakers almost always charge a fee. So I’ll definitely follow up on that.
274Lecture1
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a psychology class.
Professor
We’ve been talking about animal cognition—the study of animal intelligence. Now, much of the research in this area is
motivated by the search for animal analogues, or parallels to human cognitive processes. And one of the processes we’ve
been investigating is metacognition. What is metacognition? Well, it’s being aware of what one knows or feels, uh, um… having an awareness of one’s state of
mind. And making decisions about behavior based on what one knows. Researchers have long been interested in whether
animals possess this capability, but…but couldn’t test it because animals aren’t able to report their feelings.
But recently one group of researchers found a way to solve this problem. They did studies with…with monkeys and
dolphins that provide evidence that these animals have the ability to feel uncertainty, to feel unsure about something
and…and…well, to know that they are uncertain.
So how could these researchers figure out if an animal feels uncertainty. Well, it began with a study one of them did on a
dolphin, who had been trained to recognize a particular high-pitched tone. The dolphin was taught to press one of two
paddles depending on whether it heard the high tone or one that was lower. Food was a reward for a correct response. But if
the wrong paddle was pressed, the dolphin had to wait several seconds before it could try again. The task varied in difficulty
according to the pitch of the second tone. The closer it came in pitch to the first one, the hard it became for the dolphin to
correctly identify it as low. And the researcher noted that the dolphin is quite eager to press the paddle when it was sure of
the answer, but exhibited hesitation during difficult trials.
Next the researcher introduced a third option, a third paddle that would initiate a new trial, giving the dolphin the choice of
passing on difficult trials. Once the dolphin figured out the result of pressing this new paddle, it did choose it frequently
when the trial was difficult. The researcher took that as an indication that the animal wanted to pass because it didn’t know
the answer and knew it didn’t know.
But there was a problem. Other researchers protested that the… the opt-out response was simply a learned or conditioned
response. You remember intro to psychology, right? In other words, by pressing the pass paddle, the dolphin avoided having
to wait and hasten the possibility of a full reward by moving directly to the next trial. So the experiment didn’t necessarily
indicate that the dolphin had knowledge of its own uncertainty, just that it wanted to avoid negative consequences.
So more recently, our researcher and his colleagues devised a new study, this time using monkeys. In this experiment, the
monkeys had to identify certain patterns displayed on a computer screen. These patterns were analogous to the tones used in
the dolphin study. One type of pattern was of a specific density and was to be classified as dense, while the second type of
pattern could vary in density, but was always less dense than the first one. And the monkeys’ task was to identify this second
type as sparse. So the denser the second type of pattern was, the more difficult the task became.
And as in a previous study, the monkeys were given a third choice that would allow them to pass on to a new trial. But
unlike in the dolphin experiment, the monkeys had to complete four trials before they got any feedback. They didn’t know if
they responded correctly or incorrectly after each trial because there was no reward or punishment. At the end of four trials,
feedback was given. The monkeys received a full reward for each correct response. And a time-out during which a buzzer
was sounded for each incorrect response. But the monkeys had no way to tell which reward or punishment was associated
with which response. And they didn’t get either reward or punishment for choosing the pass option, the…um…the
275uncertainty response. But nevertheless they still chose this option in the appropriate circumstances when the trial was
particularly difficult. And this is evidence that it wasn’t a conditioned response, because that response didn’t guarantee a
faster reward.
So what does all this tell us about animal consciousness or animals’ awareness of themselves and their state of mind? Can
we really know what’s going on in the minds of animals? No. Of course not. But exploring the metacognitive capacity of
animals could become an important criterion in highlighting the similarities and differences between human and animal
minds.

276Lecture2-Paleontology
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a paleontology class.
Professor
As we’ve discussed, birds are apparently descendants of dinosaurs and shared many commonalities with some dinosaur
species, like…um…feathers and maybe even flight and of course egg laid. OK.
So, many paleontologists, myself included, have wondered about other similarities between dinosaurs and birds. Since adult
dinosaur fossils have sometimes been discovered near or on top of nests, we’ve been looking at the dinosaur parenting
behavior.
Student
Parenting behavior, well, that sounds so gentle and caring. But dinosaurs were ferocious reptiles and reptiles don’t take care
of their young, do they?
Professor
Well, some reptiles incubate their eggs, crocodiles do. And as for popular attitudes towards dinosaurs…well, take the
Oviraptor for instance.
In the 1920s, a paleontologist discovered the fossil remains of a small dinosaur near a nest containing eggs. He assumed the
dinosaur was stealing the eggs, so he named it Oviraptor that means egg thief in Latin, which fueled the generally negative
public image of such dinosaurs.
But by the 1990s, other experts had convincingly made the case that instead of robbing the nest; the Oviraptor was probably
taking care of the eggs. You see, dinosaurs’ closest living relatives – birds and crocodiles – display nesting behavior. And
dinosaur fossils have been found in postures that we now believe to indicate brooding behavior, that is, sitting on the eggs
until they hatch.
So we are curious about the type of care dinosaurs gave to their young. And we’d like to figure out which dinosaur parent,
the male or the female gave the care.
Student
Shouldn’t the behavior of crocodiles and birds give us some clues then?
Professor
Well, with crocodiles, it is the female who guards the nest, and with birds, it depends on the species, it can be the male or
the female that takes care the eggs, or both. In over 90 percent of all bird species, both parents take care of the eggs and the
young birds.
Student
But sometimes it’s just the male?
Professor
Well, exclusive care by the male parent is much less common, but it does occur. Now, for animals other than birds, the care
277of young by both parents is pretty unusual in the animal kingdom. Males contribute to parental care in fewer than five
percent of all mammalian species. It’s even less frequent among reptiles. And exclusive care by the male is very rare. So
researchers have wondered about the evolution of male parenting behavior in birds for quite some time. And now there’s
research showing that for some of the birds’ dinosaur relatives, it’s likely that the male parent was also in charge of taking
care of the eggs.
Student
How did they figure that out?
Professor
Well, first they looked at clutch volume, that’s the number of eggs in the nest of crocodiles, birds and three types of
dinosaurs, including Oviraptors that are thought to be closely related to the dinosaur ancestors of birds.
So when researchers examined fossilized remains of nests, they found that the dinosaurs had larger clutch volumes, more
eggs in the nests that is, than most of the crocodiles and birds that were studied. But, and this is important, their clutch
volumes matched those of birds that have only male parental care. You see, bird species in which only the males take care of
the nest tend to have the largest clutches of eggs.
Student
So what’s the connection between bird and dinosaur behavior?
Professor
Well, researchers now believe, because of this study, that the male parenting behavior of these birds might have its origins in
the behavior of dinosaurs.
Student
Based only on evidence of clutch volume size, the number of eggs?
Professor
No, there’s more. They also examined the fossilized bones of those three types of dinosaurs that were found on or near nests
to determine their sex. You see, adult female birds during egg production produce a layer of spongy bone tissue inside
certain long bones. And so did female dinosaurs of the kinds that were investigated. This spongy tissue serves as a source of
calcium for eggshell formation. But when the dinosaur fossils were examined, there were no spongy bone deposits.
Student
Meaning that those dinosaurs on the nests were probably adult males who wouldn’t have needed calcium for making
eggshells.
Professor
Exactly. And then there’s this: birds like the kiwi, the ostrich and the emu; they share certain physical characteristics with
these dinosaurs. And interestingly, they also show a consistent pattern of nest care by the male.

Conversation2
Narrator
Listen to a conversation between a student and his art history professor.
Professor
How was the museum?
Student
Great. I hadn’t been there for a few years.
Professor
Did you enjoy the Van Gogh painting?
Student
That’s the thing. Looks like I have to change my topic.
Professor
Hmm… we are getting close to the deadline. You were writing about the theme of night in the paintings of Vincent Van
Gogh.
It’s a wonderful topic.
Student
I know. People don’t usually think of Van Gogh as an artist of nocturnal themes. They think of brightness, sunshine, all that
yellow and orange.
Professor
You are right of course about the intense light associated with his daytime paintings. But his night paintings don’t exactly
lack brightness.
Student
That’s the paradox that I really like, the paradox of painting a nighttime scene using so much color and light. So I was
planning to focus mostly on his painting Starry Night.
Professor
But?
Student
When I went to the museum to look at the actual painting, like you told me to. It wasn’t there.
Professor
Really? Isn’t it part of the permanent collection?
Student
Yes. But it’s on loan right now to a museum in Europe.
280Professor
Ah, I see. Well, I am strict about having students write about paintings they can observe firsthand.
Student
Well, I found another painting I could study instead.
Professor
OK.
Student
I read that there are two paintings called Starry Night. The first one was done by the French realist painter Millet. It may
have been the inspiration for Van Gogh’s painting. Millet’s painting is located near my family’s house in Connecticut. And I
am going there this weekend and could study it then. I made sure it’s not out on loan.
Professor
That definitely would work then. Van Gogh copied many of Millet’s compositions. We know that he really admired Millet’s
work. And a lot of us think Van Gogh saw this particular painting by Millet in Paris in the late 1700s.
Student
Yeah. Although Millet was a realist painter, and Van Gogh a post-impressionist, the two paintings still share lots of features,
not just the name. The most striking shared feature has got to be the amazing light effects. I am excited to go see it. But one
other thing …
Professor
Uh-huh.
Student
I was thinking about getting a head start on my next assignment while I am at the gallery in Connecticut, the assignment on
miniatures. They have a lot of miniature portraits of children as part of their permanent collection.
Professor
American miniatures?
Student
Yeah. So I figured I could also get started on that essay, study a few while I am there. I’d focus on the meaning of the
objects that some of the children are holding, some are holding flowers, one child has a rattle, another a toy violin…
Professor
That would be fine. Uh, those objects…we call them attributes. The attributes chosen to be included in a particular
miniature was often meant to communicate parents’ hopes and dreams for their child. So I think you’ll learn a lot about how
people viewed children at the time the miniature paintings were done.
281Lecture3-Astronomy
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an astronomy class.
Professor
There’s been a lot of talk recently about life on Mars, at the level of microorganisms anyway, mainly because of a few
important discoveries and inventions.
For example, one major discovery was that at one point water was present on Mars. How do we know? Well, in 2004, an
exploration robot discovered jarosite there.
Jarosite is a yellowish brown mineral with a crystalline structure that’s also found on Earth. It contains iron, potassium and
hydroxide. The interesting thing is that on Earth at least it needs highly acidic water to form. So we’ve got water or had it at
one point. And since most planetary scientists believe that water is essential to life, the presence of jarosite means that one
prerequisite for life was once present on Mars.
But there’s another thing about jarosite. One step in its formation on Earth involves microorganisms; they actually speed up
the formation of jarosite dramatically. Now, theoretically it is possible for jarosite to form without the help of biological life
forms. But we don’t really know for sure if this happens ‘cause… well, because every corner of Earth has some form of
biological life.
But jarosite on Earth incorporates all kinds of microorganisms into its crystalline structure. So it’s possible that if the
jarosite on Mars was also formed with the help of microorganisms, we might be able to detect remnants of them in the
samples we find. And we have instruments now that will enable us to try to do this. For example, there’s a new instrument
called the microfabricated organic analyzer, or M.O.A.
The organic analyzer is an amazing tool. It will be able to collect soil samples and analyze them right there on Mars, pure,
untouched samples. It will let us eliminate the risk we would take of contaminating the samples if they were brought back to
Earth. And what they’ll look for specifically in the soil is amino acids. Amino acids, as you may know, are the building blocks of proteins. In fact, there are twenty standard amino acids involved
in making proteins and lots more that aren’t.
And here’s the important thing. Amino acids are what we call handed. They can exist in two forms, which are mirror images
of each other like hands. Right and left hands have the same number of fingers in the same order plus one thumb. But right
and left hands are not the same; they are mirror images. Well, like hands, amino acids can be right or left-handed. And the
twenty that make up the proteins on Earth are all left-handed.
Now, one reason the M.O.A., the organic analyzer is so impressive is that it tests not just for the presence of amino acids but
also for the handedness of amino acids. If amino acids are found, it would be especially interesting if they show a
prevalence of one type of handedness, either left, like amino acids on Earth, or right.
See, other physical processes in space, processes that don’t involve living organisms, can create amino acids. But the ones
synthesized through abiotic processes, which is to say not involving microorganisms, occur in equal numbers of right- and
left-handed.
282So, a prevalence of left-handed amino acids would indicate they were biological in origin, which would be amazing! A
prevalence of right-handed ones…well, that would be really amazing!! Because the organisms that created them would be
unlike anything we have on Earth, which produce only left-handed ones.
283Lecture4-Music History
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a music history class. The professor has been discussing music of the twentieth century.
Professor
And what instrument comes to mind when you think of rock ‘n’ roll?
Student
The electric Guitar?
Professor
Exactly. I think it’s fair to say that the sound of the electric guitar typifies the rock ‘n’ roll genre, which became popular in
the 1950s. But really the instrument we know today was the result of a continuing development that started for our practical
purposes in the 1920s.
But long before that even, people were experimenting with ways to modify traditional acoustic guitars. The first guitars
were wooden. This is the Spanish guitar and the strings were made from animal products. Then came steel strings. And that
led to the lap guitar, which is also called the steel guitar because the player slides a steel rod up and down the neck. And
those are all acoustic guitars. OK?
But then eventually we have electric guitars. Over the years, many inventors and musicians contributed to the design of
these instruments. And each design was intended to alter the sound in some way, at first at least with the electric guitar, to
make it louder.
So let’s get back to when the steel guitar was first introduced in the United States. It was right after the Spanish-American
war in the late 1890s. US sailors who were stationed in Hawaii—then a US territory—were very enamored with the music
they heard there. Uh, Hawaiian music was based on the steel guitar I just described. Some sailors learned how to play the
steel guitar and brought it home to the States. Before long, Hawaiian steel guitar music was all the rage3 in the mainland
US. It actually had a strong influence on the development of several musical genres, rock ‘n’ roll most notably, but also jazz
and blues.
Anyway, by the 1920s, with the advent of the public dance movement, people were gathering in large groups to listen to
steel guitar music. But they had trouble hearing it, especially in large public settings. As I mentioned, the instrument was
played horizontally, on the lap. Since the strings faced upward, the sound was projected toward the ceiling rather than
outward toward the audience. Something had to be done, because the music venues and the audience kept getting larger and
larger. So what would you do?
Student
Find a way to amplify the sound?
Professor
Yes. And to do that, inventors started attaching electronic devices, electrical coils to the acoustic guitars. And the electronics
worked! But attaching electronics didn’t just affect how loudly you could play. It also changed the quality of the sound.
3 a widespread temporary enthusiasm or fashion: computer games are all the rage .
284These early electric guitars were hollow and these early amplifiers caused vibrations in the bodies of the instruments. So as
the sound got louder, it became more distorted, fuzzy-sounding. And what musicians at the time wanted was a pure, clean
sound.
Student
So where does Les Paul fit in? Wasn’t he the first to electrify acoustic guitars?
Professor
Uh…no. Electrified guitars already existed by the time Les Paul came into the picture around 1940. What Paul did was
experiment with ways of removing the distortions and he succeeded. He designed a guitar with a solid body that relied
solely on electronics. Paul’s solid body eliminated the vibrations, and thus the distortions.
Student
Excuse me. But when I think of electric guitar music, I think of Jimi Hendrix. Professor
Jimi Hendrix, one of my favorites.
Student
But Hendrix’s style really was all about distortion, that’s what’s so great about his music, all those special effects. I think a
lot of rock ‘n’ roll fans prefer that to a pure sound.
Professor
Yeah. You are getting ahead of me here. But good, because the point I was going to make is that the sound of rock ‘n’ roll
changed over the years. And the designs and technology of electric guitars made those changes possible.
So whereas Les Paul’s goal was to remove the distortion, later musicians wanted to produce it. And by the time Jimi
Hendrix came around. Well, essentially, Hendrix reinvented the electric guitar, in the sense that he created amazing effects
and vibrations that changed the sound of rock ‘n’ roll completely. So eventually, people tried to improve on Les Paul’s
model, well, to modify it I should say.

Conversation1 (Community Planning in the Colonies)
Narrator
Listen to part of a conversation between a student and her United States History professor.
Professor
So, Amanda, you’ve asked a lot of questions about trade during the colonial period of the United States. Has our discussion
clarified things for you?
Student
Well, yeah, but now, I think writing about trade for my paper isn’t going to work.
Professor
Oh, so your questions about shipping routes were for your research paper?
Student
Yeah. But now, I see that I probably need to come up with a new paper topic. Actually, there was one other idea I had. I have
been thinking about doing something about community planning in the early British settlements in Eastern North America.
Professor
285Oh. OK. I am curious. Why are you interested in doing something on community planning in colonial times?
Student
Well, I am much more into architecture. It’s my major and I mean, planning out a town or city goes along with that. I mean,
not that I don’t like history…I am interested in history…really interested…But I think, you know, for a career, architecture
is more for me.
Professor
That’s great. I’ve gotten some very thought-provoking papers from students whose interests go beyond history.
Student
OK. But for the paper you wanted us to try to include a comparison, right?
Professor
Yes. Actually, that was really the purpose of the assignment. The way the United States developed or perhaps I should say
the colonies, since the land that would become the Eastern United States…uh…there were British colonies there four
hundred years ago. But anyway…uh… development in the colonies differed greatly depending on geography. I am looking
for papers that have ideas about something that happened one way in the Northern colonies happened a different way in the
Southern colonies.
Student
Is that true in terms of urban planning?
Professor
Very true. Towns in the Northern colonies were centralized and compact. They provided a meeting point for exchanging
goods, for participatory government, and for practicing religion. Houses would be built along the roads that led into town.
And just outside the developed area, there would usually be an open area of some sort for grazing animals and also group
activities. Actually, the model for planning a town in the Northern colonies was not unlike the model for the development of
towns in medieval Europe. After all, the colonists had just come from Europe and the medieval period was just ended.
Student
Medieval Europe. But what about the South? If I remember correctly… In the South, at least initially, they didn’t build
towns so much as they built trading posts.
Professor
That’s right. Most of the settlers in the North wanted to start a whole new life. But most of the people who came fromEurope to the South just wanted to make some money and then go back. It is not surprising that some of most common
buildings were storage facilities and port facilities.
Lecture1-Music (Ancient Greek Music & Plato)
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a music class.
Professor
Today we are going to do something a little different. In the past few classes, we’ve listened to traditional music fromaround the world and we’ve talked about the characteristics of these music, what makes these styles distinctive, what kinds
of instruments are used. And you’ve talked about what sounds familiar to you and what sounds strange. And many of you
found some of what we’ve listened to very strange indeed.
Well, today I want to start talking about western music and I am going to start in ancient Greece. But, now here’s the part
that’s different. We’re not going to talk very much about the actual music. Instead, we are going to talk about what the
Greeks believed about music.
Now, there are some very good reasons to approach the material in this way. First, well, we don’t have very much ancient
Greek music studied. Only about 45 pieces survived…uh…these are mostly records of poems and songs. And we are not
sure how well we can reproduce the melodies or rhythms, because they were apparently improvised in many cases. So we
really don’t know all that much about what the music sounded like.
286What we do know about - and this really is the most important reason I am approaching today’s lecture the way I am - is the
Greek philosophy about music and its continuing influence on western attitudes toward music.
Now, if we’re going to understand the philosophy, we have to first understand that music for the Greeks was about much
more than entertainment. Yes, there was music at festivals and we have sculptures and paintings showing people listening to
music for many of the same reasons that we do. But this isn’t the whole story.
The important thing about music was that it was governed by rules, mathematical rules. And for those of you who are also
studying music theory, you’ll see that it is in fact highly mathematical.
Um…and for the Greeks, the same mathematical principles that govern music also govern the universe as well as the human
character, the essence of personality. People’s characters were believed to be very sensitive to music. If you started playing
around with the rules, you know, messing up the mathematical order, you could do serious harm. That’s why music was
considered so powerful. If you knew the rules, it could do great good. But if you broke them, you could do great harm to the
character of the listener.
So, we have this Greek idea that music is directly related to human character and behavior.
The philosopher, Plato, talks about this in the context of education. For Plato, music is an important element in education,
but only the right kind of music. That means the kind of music that builds the kind of character a good citizen or a future
leader would need. Yes. For Plato, there is a kind of music that instills the qualities of leadership, just as there is a kind of
music that makes a person soft and weak.
Now, Plato has very specific, very conventional kinds of music in mind. He is not fond of innovation. There were musicians
in Plato’s day who were experimenting with different melodies and rhythms. A definite no-no for Plato. He thinks that
breaking with tradition leads to all sorts of social problems, serious problems, even the breakdown of the fabric of society. I
am thinking back now to when I first started listening to rock ‘n’ roll and I remember my father saying it was a bad
influence on us. I think he would have gotten along well with Plato.
Anyway, I don’t need to tell you what I think about Plato’s ideas about innovation, do I? Though I have to say it’s
interesting that the same arguments against new music and art are still being made. Perhaps like the Greeks, we recognize,
and maybe even fear the power of music.
Lecture2-Geology (Movement of Tectonic Plates)
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a geology class.
Professor
As we’ve discussed, Earth’s crust is made up of large plates that rest on a mantle of molten rock. These plates…uh…now
these tectonic plates support the continents and oceans. Over time, the tectonic plates move and shift, which moves the
continents and the ocean floors too. Once it was understood how these plates move, it was possible to determine past
movements of Earth’s continents and how these slow movements have reshaped Earth’s features at different times.
OK. Well, (as)studying the movements of the plates can tell us about the location of the continents in the past, it can
conceivably tell us about their location in the future too, right? So, in recent years, some geologists have used plate tectonic
theory to make what they call geopredictions. Geopredictions are guesses about what Earth’s surface might look like
millions of years from now.
So, we know how certain continents are currently moving. For example, the continents of Africa has been creeping north
toward Europe. And Australia has been making its way north too, toward Asia.
Does anyone know what’s happening to the Americas? I…I think we’ve talked about that before. Lisa?
Student
They are moving westward, away from Europe and Africa. Right?
Professor
Right. And what makes us think that?
287Student
The Atlantic Oceanfloor is spreading and getting wider, so there is more ocean between the Americas and Europe and
Africa.
Professor
OK. And why is it spreading?
Student
Well, the seafloor is spilt. There is a ridge, a mountain range that runs north and south there. And the rock material flows up
from Earth’s interior here, at the split, which forces the two sides of the ocean floor to spread apart, to make room for the
new rock material.
Professor
Good. And that means, over the short term…uh… and by short term I mean 50 million years, that’s a blink of the eye in
geological time. Um…over the short term, we can predict that the Americas will continue to move westward, farther away
from Europe, while Africa and Australia will continue to move northward.
But what about over the long term? Say 250 million years or more. Well, over that length of time, forecasts become more
uncertain. But lots of geologists predict that eventually all the continents, including Antarctica, will merge and become one
giant land mass, a super continent, one researchers callingPangaea Ultima, which more or less means the last super
continent. The above text is a transcript of this lecture prepared by lady&bird.
Now, how that might happen is open to some debate. Some geologists believe that the Americas will continue to move
westward and eventually merge with East Asia. This hypothesis is based on the direction the Americas are moving in now.
But others hypothesize that a new super continent will form in a different way. They think that a new subduction zone will
might occur at the western edge of the Atlantic Ocean.
Paul, can you remind us what a subduction zone is?
Student
Yeah. Um…basically, a subduction zone is where two tectonic plates collide. So if an ocean floor tectonic plate meets the
edge of a continent and they push against each other, the heavier one sinks down and goes under the other one. So
the…um…the oceanic plate is made of denser and heavier rock, so it begins to sink down under the continental plate and
into the mantle.
Professor
Right. So the ocean floor would kind of slide under the edge of the continent. And once the ocean plate begins to sink, it
would be affected by another force – slab pull. Slab pull happens at the subduction zone.
So to continue our example… As the ocean floor plate begins to sink down into the mantle, it would drag or pull the entire
plate along with it. So more and more of this plate, the ocean floor, would go down under the continent into the mantle.
OK?
So, as I said, currently the Atlantic Ocean floor is spreading, getting wider, but some researchers speculate that eventually a
subduction zone will occur where the oceanic plate meets the continental plate of the Americas. If that happens, slab pull
could draw the oceanic crust under the continent, actually causing the Americas to move eastward toward Europe and the
ocean floor to get smaller. That is, the Atlantic Ocean would start to close up, narrowing the distance between the eastern
edge of the Americas and Europe and Africa. So they form a single super continent.

Conversation2 (Credits for Internship)
Narrator
Listen to a conversation between a student and an employee at the university center for off-campus study.
Student
Hi. I am Tom Arnold. I am supposed to pick up a packet from the regional center for marine research. I am doing an
internship there this summer.
Employee
288Yes. I have it right here. The mail carrier dropped it off a few minutes ago.
Student
Thanks. Um…I wanted to ask about getting credits for the internship. I don’t know if…
Employee
I might be able to help you with that. Is there a problem?
Student
I just wanted to make sure the details have been corrected. The system should show that I am registered to earn four credits.
But as of Friday, nothing was showing up yet. I was told it would be fixed this morning.
Employee
Well, I can check on the computer for you. Tom Arnold, right?
Student
Yes.
Employee
Well, it is showing credits…but only three.
Student
Really?! So now what? These all have to be finalized last week.
Employee
Well, yes. The course enrollment period ended last week. But since our office was supposed to get this straightened out for
you before then… Let me see what I can do.
Uh…did the university give approval for you to earn four credits for this internship? Because the other students at the center
for marine research are only getting three.
Student
Um…I am pretty sure those other students are doing the internship at the center’s aquarium, taking classes in marine
biology and then teaching visitors about the various displays. I am doing a special research internship with the center. We’ll
be collecting data on changes to the seafloor out in the open ocean.
Employee
Oh. That sounds quite advanced.
Student
Well, the internship requires me to have scuba diving certification and to be a senior oceanography student. I want to do
advanced study in oceanography when I graduate. So I really want to get a sense of what real research is like.
Employee
I see. Now let’s try and see if we can… Oh. OK. I see the problem. There are two kinds of internships listed here—regular
and research. Yours is listed as regular so it is only showing three credits.
Student
Can you switch it?
Employee
Not yet. But it lists Professor Leonard as…
Student
She is in charge of all the internships.
Employee
She just needs to send an email so I have an official record. Then I can switch it. And that should solve everything.
Student
Great! And I know Professor Leonard is in her office this afternoon, so I can go there later. It will be such a relief to get all
these paperwork completed.
289Lecture3-Marine Biology (Coral Reefs & CoT starfish)
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a Marine Biology class.
Professor
We’ve been talking about the decline of coral reefs in tropical areas all over the world…um… how natural and man-made
stresses are causing them to degrade, and in some cases, to die.
So now let’s focus on a specific example of a natural predator that can cause a lot of damage to coral reefs—the Crown of
Thorns, or CoT starfish. The Cot starfish is found on coral reefs in the tropical Pacific Ocean and it eats coral. Now, in small
numbers, the starfish don’t affect coral reefs dramatically. But periodically, starfish population explodes. And when that
happens, the reefs can become badly damaged or even destroyed, something we are trying very hard to prevent. For
example, during the 1960s, there was an outbreak of CoT starfish in the Great Barrier Reef, off the east coast of Australia.
Luckily, the CoT starfish population gradually declined on its own and the reefs recovered.
But we were left wondering – what cause the population to increase so suddenly? Well, over the years, we’ve come up with
a few hypotheses. All still hotly debated.
One hypothesis is that it’s a natural phenomenon, that the starfish naturally undergo population fluctuations following
particularly good spawning years.
There are also several hypotheses that suggest some sort of human activities are partly responsible, like fishing. There are
fish and snails that eat starfish, particularly the giant triton snail, which is the main predator of the starfish. These fish and
snails have themselves experienced a decline in population because of overfishing by humans. So with a decline in starfish
predators, the starfish population can increase.
Another hypothesized human-related cause is fertilizer runoff. People use fertilizer for their crops and plants and a lot of it
eventually makes its way from land into the seas. It’s fertilizer, so it has a lot of nutrients. These nutrients have an effect on
the starfish, because they cause an increase in the growth of phytoplankton. Phytoplankton are microscopic plants that grow
in the ocean. Larval CoT starfish eat phytoplankton in their first month of life, so more fertilizer in the ocean means more
phytoplankton, which means more starfish, bad for the reefs.
Now, the final hypothesis has to do with storm events. If some reefs are destroyed by storms, starfish populations that
inhabited those reefs would have to condense and concentrate on the reefs that are left. So this can cause a kind of mass
feeding frenzy.
So we have ideas, but no real answer. And because we aren’t sure of the causes for starfish population increases, it’s difficult
to prevent them. I mean, some progress has been made. For example, new survey techniques have enabled us to detect
population increases when the starfish are quite young, so we can be ready for them. But meaningful progress requires
much better evidence about the cause.
On the bright side, in all the research being done on causes, we have discovered something related to how starfish
populations might affect coral reef diversity. We think that when reefs are damaged, after a few years, the fastest-growing
corals repopulate the areas. And these fast-growing species can grow over the slower-growing species of coral, denying
them light and preventing them from recovery. However, the faster-growing species are the preferred food of the CoT
starfish. So when an outbreak of CoT starfish occurs, they thin out the fast-growing coral and may give the slower ones a
chance to reestablish. So without the outbreak, the diversity of coral would be reduced.
Lecture4-Anthropology (the Botai People & Horses)
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an anthropology class.
290Professor
So now that we’ve discussed how people in ancient societies tamed animals like cows and chickens for food and other uses.
I’d like to talk about an ancient culture that domesticated horses. It’s the Botai people.
The Botai culture thrived over 5,000 years ago in central Asia, in what is now northern Kazakhstan. Pretty much all of what
we know about the Botai comes from three archaeological sites. And we learned that the Botai were able to build large
perennial villages, sometimes with hundreds of homes. We also found horse bones at these sites and these can be traced
back to the time of the Botai settlements. The climate that the Botai culture lived in…it was harsh. And the Botai
people…they didn’t really seem to have much in the way of agriculture going on. So their whole economy was really based
on horses. And because horses can withstand the tough climate, they can survive ice storms and they don’t need heated
barns, the Botai people could settle in one place and rely on the horses for food, clothing and transportation.
Student
So the Botai were the first to domesticate horses?
Professor
Well, we are pretty sure that horses were first domesticated a bit earlier, to the northwest, in the area that is now Ukraine and
western Russia. It’s quite possible that some of those people later migrated east to Kazakhstan.
Student
But what exactly tells us that these Botai people, that the horses in their area were really domesticated?
Professor
As with most ancient history, there is not much that we can be certain about. But we know there was a significant
population of wild horses in that area. So there were plenty of opportunities for the Botai people to find horses to
domesticate. We also know that horse milk was an important source of food for the Botai people. What? Milking a wild
horse? Well, now, that would be impossible…to milk a wild horse. And then… there’s the…
Oh. Yes? Eric.
Student
So you said last week that for some animals, like for dogs, there were physical changes taking place over the course of
generations of dogs because of domestication. So can we tell from those horse bones if it was sort of the same for horses?
Professor
Actually, it wasn’t. We know that horses have not changed a lot physically as a result of domestication. So those ancient
horse bones don’t tell us much about domestication. But…we’ve found that…um…we’ve found what maybe pens or corrals
in the Botai settlements. And not too long ago, a new approach was used to find out if the Botai people were keeping horses.
Soil samples from these pens or corrals show ten times the concentration of phosphorus.
Student
Um…phosphorus?
Professor
Yes. Phosphorus is a very significant indicator that horses, large numbers of horses were being kept in the settlements. You
see, horse manure, horse waste is rich in phosphorus and also nitrogen compared to normal soil. But nitrogen is an unstable
element. It can be washed out when it rains or it can be released to the atmosphere, whereas phosphorus combines with
calcium and iron, and can be preserved in the soil for thousands of years.
The soil from the Botai settlement sites was found to have high concentrations of phosphorus and low nitrogen
concentrations, which is important since it suggests that what we’ve got is really old, not something added to the soil more
recently.
Student
Wait. So if horses have been there recently, there’d still be lots of nitrogen in the soil.
Professor
That’s right. Yes. Karen.
Student
I just read an article. It said that one way to determine if there was an ancient fireplace at an archaeological site was to
check the soil for phosphorus. So couldn’t the phosphorus at the Botai sites just be from the frequent use of fireplaces?
291Professor
You are absolutely right. However, when a fireplace leaves behind a lot of phosphorus in the soil, we’d also find an
unusually high concentration of potassium. But the soil at the Botai settlements, it was found with relatively little potassium,
which makes it far more likely that the phosphorus came from horses. OK?
Now, later on, people of the same region, northern Kazakhstan, started raising sheep and cattle. And that led to a more
nomadic culture. Since sheep and cattle can’t survive harsh climates, they needed to be taken south every winter. Moving
around meant working harder but the trade-off was far richer, fattier milk year round and warm clothing from the sheep.

Conversation1
Listen to a conversation between a student and a bookstore employee.
Employee
Hi. Can I help you?
Student
Yeah. I need to sell back a textbook. Are you the person I speak to about that?
Employee
I am. But we can’t buy textbooks back just yet, because the bookstore’s buyback period isn’t until next Thursday.
Student
I thought it started this week.
Employee
It is only in the last week of the semester after classes are over.
Student
Oh. Well, can you tell me if this book will be on the buyback list?
Employee
I can look. But we are still putting the list together. Professors have to tell us what books they’ll definitely need again next
semester, and the deadline for them to let us know isn’t for a couple of days. So the list I have here is not really complete. Um…what class was the book for?
Student
Intro to economics, with Professor Murphy.
Employee
Professor Murphy. OK. I checked earlier and I know she hasn’t gotten back to us on that class yet. So we don’t know if
she’ll use the same book next time. Usually if an updated edition of a textbook is available, professors will go for that one.
Student
Um…so if this book doesn’t end up on the buyback list, what can I do? I spent over a hundred dollars for it, and I want to
get something back.
Employee
Well, if a professor didn’t assign it for a class here, we could buy back for a whole seller who would distribute it for sale at
another university bookstore.
Student
OK.
Employee
292Anyway…if Professor Murphy does put it on the list, it is important thatyou come in as early as possible next Thursday.
There’s only a limited number of books we would buy back. Once we get the number of books we need for next semester,
we would stop buying them.
Student
OK. So how much money will I get for the book?
Employee
Well, if it’s on the buyback list, we’ll pay fifty percent of what the new price was. But that also depends on what condition
the book is in, so it needs to be cleaned up as much as possible.
Student
Cleaned up?
Employee
Because used books show wear and tear, you know, water stains, scruffy covers, yellow highlighting…You really need to
make sure there are no pencil marks on the book. The price you can get for a text depends on the shape it’s in.
Student
You mean I have to erase all the pencil marks?
Employee
If you want the best price for it…
Student
And what if you decide the book is too beat-up and don’t buy it back?
Employee
That does happen. Hmm…well, one more thing you can try is to place an ad in the student newspaper to see if you can sell
it directly to another student.
Lecture1-Archaeology (Bananas & African History)
Listen to part of a lecture in an archaeology class.
Professor
One of the important aspects of the field of archaeology…one of the things that excites me about the field…is that
seemingly insignificant things can suddenly change the way we think about a culture.We are always making new
discoveries that have the potential to challenge widely held beliefs.
Take something like the banana, for example. It turns out that this ordinary fruit may be forcing scientists to rewrite major
parts of African history! We know the bananas were introduced to Africa via Southeast Asia. And until recently, we thought
we knew when they were introduced—about 2,000 years ago. But discoveries in Uganda, that’s in Eastern Africa, are
throwing that into question. Scientists studying soil samples there discovered evidence of bananas in sediment that was
5,000 years old!
Now, let me explain that it’s not easy to find traces of ancient bananas. The fruit is soft and doesn’t have any hard seeds that
might survive over the ages. So after 5,000 years, you might think there would be nothing left to study. Well, fortunately for
archaeologists, all plants contain what are called phytoliths in their stems and leaves. Phytoliths are microscopic structures
made of silica, and they do not decay. When plants die and rot away, they leave these phytoliths behind. Because different
plants produce differently shaped phytoliths, scientists can identify the type of plant from ancient remains.
So, those scientists in Uganda, dug down to sediments that were 5,000 years old. And what do you think they found?
Banana phytoliths! Obviously this meant that we had to rethink our previous notions about when bananas first arrived in
Africa. But, well, this discovery had other implications for history.
As soon as bananas appear in the archaeological record, we know we have contact between Africa and Southeast Asia. It
293would appear now that this contact occurred much earlier than previously thought.
Al…although…now here’s where the uncertainty comes in…we don’t really have any solid evidence of trade between the
peoples of these two regions that long ago. Presumably, if people were bringing bananas to Africa, they’d also be bringing
other things too: pottery, tools…all sorts of objects made for trade or daily use. But any such evidence is missing from the
archaeological record.
The early appearance of bananas also suggests that agriculture began in this part of Africa earlier than scientists
imagined.You see, bananas, at least the edible kind, can’t grow without human intervention. They have to be cultivated.
People need to plant them and care for them. So if bananas were present in Uganda 5,000 years ago, we would have to
assume…that…that…that someone planted them.
The above text is a transcript of this lecture prepared by lady&bird (QQ519626928).
But, there are questions about this too. We know that bananas can be a staple food that can support large populations, as
they did in Uganda in the more recent past. If bananas were grown thousands of years ago, why don’t we see evidence of
large populations thriving in the area earlier?
So, we are left with this mystery. We have what appears to be strong biological evidence that bananas were being cultivated
in Uganda as early as 5,000 years ago. But we are missing other kinds of evidence that would conclusively prove that this is
so.
Clearly, more research needs to be done. Perhaps by some new scholars from this university? At least give it some thought.
Lecture2-Biology (Populations in an Ecosystem)
Listen to part of a lecture in a biology class.
Student
Professor, since we are going to talk about changes in animal populations in the wild, I’d like to ask about somethingI read
in an article online, about how the population size of some animal species can affect other animal species, and how other
environmental factors come into play too.
Professor
Right. Relationships between animal species in a given ecosystem can get pretty complex. Because in addition to
predator-prey relationships, there are other variables that affect population size.
Student
The article mentioned that populations of predators and their prey might go up rapidly and then decline all of a sudden.
Student
Oh. Yeah! I read about that in my ecology class. It happens in cycles. I think that’s called a boom-and-bust cycle. Right?
Professor
OK. Well, hold on a second. First I want to go over some key concepts. Let’s say there was a species that had access to
plenty of food and ideal conditions. Under those circumstances, its population would increase exponentially, meaning it
would increase at an ever-accelerating pace.
Student
Wow! That sounds a little scary.
Professor
Well, it doesn’t usually happen. Like you said, a rapid population growth is often followed by a sudden decline. But we do
occasionally see exponential growth in nonnative species when they are transplanted into a new environment. Um…because
they face little competition and have favorable growing conditions.
294But for most species, most of the time, resources are finite. There’s only so much available…which leads me to my point.
Every ecosystem has what we call a carrying capacity. The carrying capacity is the maximum population size of a species
that can be sustained by the resources of a particular ecosystem. Resources are, of course, food, water, and just as important,
space.
Although every species has a maximum rate at which the population of that species could increase, assuming ideal
conditions for the species in its environment. There are always going to be environmental factors that limit population
growth. This is called environmental resistance. Environmental resistance is important becauseit stops populations fromgrowing out of control. Factors such food supply, predation and disease affect population size, and can change from year to
year or season to season.
Student
OK. I think I get it.
Professor
Well, let’s look at a case study. That should make things clear. Some years ago, some of my colleagues conducted an
experiment in an oak forest involving three different species: white-footed mice, gypsy moths and oak trees.The above text
is a transcript of this lecture prepared by lady&bird (QQ519626928).
OK. Now let me explain what the situation is in this forest. Oak trees produce acorns, and acorns are a primary food source
for white-footed mice. Another food source for the white-footed mice is the gypsy moth. So the size of the gypsy moth
population is controlled by the white-footed mice, which is a good thing because gypsy moth caterpillars are considered
pests. They strip away the leaves from the oak trees every ten years or so.
Student
So the mice eat both acorns from the oak trees and gypsy moths. And the gypsy moth caterpillars eat oak tree leaves.
Professor
Right. Now, what makes this set of relationships particularly interesting is that oak trees only produce a large number of
acorns every few years.
Student
So during the years with fewer acorns, the white-footed mice have to deal with a smaller food supply.
Professor
Yes. But in the years with large amounts of acorns, the mice have more food, which leads to…?
Student
The white-footed mice population growing.
Professor
And the gypsy moth population decreasing.
Student
How can we know that for sure? It seems like a big jump from more acorns to fewer gypsy moths.
Professor
Well, we can know for sure because in this oak forest, the researchers decided to test the links between acorns and the two
animal species. In some parts of the forest, they had volunteers drop a large number of extra acorns on the forest floor. And
in another section of the forest, they removed a number of white-footed mice. In the forest areas where extra acorns had
been dropped, the gypsy moth population soon went into a significant decline. But in the section of the forest where the
white-footed mice had been removed, the gypsy moth population exploded.
295Conversation2
Listen to a conversation between a student and an anthropology professor.
Professor
So how was the field trip to the Nature Center yesterday? You are in that biology class, aren’t you?
Student
Yeah. I am. The trip was amazing. We took a hike through the woods and our guide pointed out all kinds of animal and plant
species. She could identify every bird, every tree…I have to tell you. I was very impressed with her knowledge.
Professor
I am glad to hear you enjoyed the trip.
Student
Well, I am interested in getting an advanced degree in forestry after I graduate from here. So I love all this stuff.And
actually, yesterday’s trip got me thinking about my research paper for your class.
Professor
Wonderful! Tell me more.
Student
So our guide was talking about how the human need for resources had shaped the environment. And I just assumed that the
human impact on the environment was always destructive.
Professor
Ah…but that’s not necessarily true.
Student
Yeah. That’s what she was telling us. She said there’s archaeological evidence that some prehistoric cultures relied heavily
on dead wood for fuel, or…um…just cut off some of the branches of trees instead of killing the whole tree.
Professor
It is so funny you mentioned that. I was just reading an article about an archaeological site in Turkey where scientists found
evidence that ancient people had been harvesting the branches from pistachio and almond trees.The above text is a
transcript of this conversation prepared by lady&bird (QQ519626928). Of course, when you prune these trees, cutting off
just the branches like that, you are actually encouraging more growth! And you end up with a bigger crop of nuts. So this
was a pretty smart strategy for collecting wood.
Student
See, that’s what I’d like to write about. I want to look at ancient methods of wood harvesting that didn’t result in the
destruction of the whole forest.
Professor
Hmm…so you want to write your entire paper on wood harvesting?
Student
Is…is that a problem?
Professor
Well, it’s certainly a timely topic. Researchers are investigating this now. Uh…it’s just that…well…I am not sure how it fits
with the assignment. Remember you are supposed to be focusing on a particular culture or region.
Student
Yeah. Um…actually I was planning on writing about the wood harvesting practices of the people who lived here. You know,
the Native Americans who were living in this area and what that might tell us about how they lived.
Professor
OK. Well, that’s a possibility. I just want to make sure you can find enough information on that topic to write a
well-developed paper. I’d like you to get started on your research right away. Maybe even talk to that nature guide and show
296me what information you can find. Then we can talk about whether or not your topic will work.
Lecture3-Earth Science (the Copper Basin)
Listen to part of a lecture in an earth science class. The professor is discussing an area of the United States called the Copper
Basin.
Professor
Now, you may not have heard of the Copper Basin. It’s in the Eastern United States, in the Tennessee River Valley. It got its
name because settlers discovered copper there in 1843. And soon afterwards, it supported one of the largest metal mining
operations in America. At one time, four mining companies employed 2500 workers in the Copper Basin. For that time
period, it was a huge operation.
Well, this mining operation turned the Copper Basin into a desert. In the 1840s, when mining operations started, it was a
dense green forest. But in the 1940s, 100 years later, it was as barren as the moon.
Efforts to reclaim the land and restore the basin to the fertile valley it once was…well, actually, those efforts are still
ongoing. It’s been a long and tedious process. In fact, it was many years before any results were seen. Copper mining had
gone on there for more than 90 years! The damage couldn’t be reversed overnight.
Although I should mention that by 1996, the water in one of the rivers flowing through the basin was clean enough that it
was the site of the Olympic whitewaterkayaking competition. And that river is still used now for recreation.
But…anyway…let’s analyze the problem. It wasn’t the mining itself that caused such massive destruction. It was what
happened after the copper ore was extracted from the mines. It was a process called heap roasting.
Copper ore contains sulfur. And heap roasting was a way to burn away the sulfur in the copper, so they’d be left with
something closer to pure copper. Well, in the process, large vats of raw copper ore are burned slowly, for two or three
months actually, to lower the sulfur content. And this burning, well…let’s look at the results.
First, the mines were fairly remote, so there was no way to bring coal or other fuel to keep the fires going. So they cut down
local trees for fuel. And like I said, the fires burned for months. Uh…that’s a lot of fires and a lot of trees. Deforestation was
occurring at a rapid rate. And it was accelerated by the smoke from the burning ore. Big clouds of sulfuric smoke, which
was toxic to the trees, formed over the areas. Trees that hadn’t been cut for fuel were killed by the fumes.
The sulfur also mixed with the air and created sulfur dioxide. And the sulfur dioxide settled in the clouds fell to the land in
droplets of rain and sank into the soil. This is what we now call acid rain. You’ve probably heard of it. But no one used the
term back then. Anyway…the acid rain created highly acidic soil. Well, soon the soil became so acidic that nothing could
grow, nothing at all. Vegetation and wild life disappeared.
And it wasn’t just the land and the air, it was the water too. What do you think happen to the rivers? Well, there are no trees
to absorb the rain, and there was a lot of rain! So the rain eroded the soil and swept it into the rivers. This is called silting,
when soil particles are washed into the rivers. And the silting continued at an alarming rate. But this was toxic soil and toxic
runoff, the acid and metals in the soil made the once clear rivers flow bright orange.
So it was really that one step in the process of producing copper…the problems just built up and up until there was a desert
where a beautiful forest used to be.
OK. Now let’s look at reforestation and land reclamation efforts.
297Lecture4-Architectural History (Irwin & Hexagonal House)
Listen to part of a lecture in an architectural history class.
Professor
So last week we started our unit on residential architecture in the United States. So today we’ll be surveying a number of
architects who made contributions to residential architecture in the 19th century.
Now, it’s worth noting that people who designed homes at that time probably had to deal with a certain amount of
discouragement. Since there were other architects who thought it was more respectable to design the kind of buildings…and
maybe other structures…that were less…less utilitarian in their function. In fact, an article from an 1876 issue of a journal
called The American Architect and Building News stated that, and this is a quote, they stated that “the planning of houses
isn’t architecture at all”!
So keep that journal article in mind as we look at the work of an architect named Harriet Morrison Irwin. Harriet Morrison
Irwin was from the South, born in North Carolina in 1828. At the time, there weren’t many architects from the southern
United States. And as you might imagine, very few of them were women. So Irwin was really a pretty exceptional case.
And she wasn’t even formally trained as an architect. Her educational background was in literature. The above text is a
transcript of this lecture prepared by lady&bird (QQ519626928).
Yes, Vicky?
Student
So she just had like…unnatural gift for architecture?
Professor
Yes. She was actually a writer for several years. But she did have a penchant for math and engineering, so she read a lot
about it on her own. Um…especially the architectural essays written by the British critic – John Ruskin. And John Ruskin
believed what?
Student
Um…that buildings should have a lot of access to the outdoors, to nature. Ruskin said that being close to nature was great
for people’s mental and physical health.
Professor
Right! So that was an influence.
Now, Harriet Irwin’s contribution to architecture was relatively minor but still quite interesting and unique. She designed a
house with a hexagonal shape. Josh?
Student
A house with six sides? Instead of the standard, you know, four-sided home?
Professor
Yeah. The rooms inside the house were also hexagonal, six-sided. So one important thing was that the rooms were arranged
around a chimney in the center of the house, which could provide heat for the whole house through flues, uh, small air
passageways into each room, as opposed to having a fireplace in every room, which would require more cleaning and make
the air inside the house dirtier.
The house’s shape also allowedfor more windows. Each room had a large wall that could fit a couple of big winters, giving
every room a nice view of the outdoors.
Student
Plus there would be good airflow through the house.
Professor
Yes. In warm weather when you can open all the windows. Good.
The doors to the house as well…uh…the house didn’t have a main entrance or any hallways. So there could be a couple of
entry doors in different places, which like the windows, provided ready access to the outdoors.
298So, what other advantages might there be to hexagonal rooms?
(Pause…no response)
OK. Think about cleaning. What part of a room is usually the hardest to clean? Like…to sweep with a broom.
Student
Oh! The corners. Because in square or rectangular rooms, the corners are at 90 degree angles. It’s hard to reach all the dust
that gathers in the corners. But if Irwin’s rooms were closer to a circle than a square, it would be easier to reach all the dust
and dirt with a broom. Right?
Professor
Exactly.
Now, um…biographers who wrote about Irwin in the 19th century, I feel, sort of downplayed the ingenuity of her design.
But I think if she had designed this house today, the same biographers would praise her for coming up with a floor plan that
emphasized function, efficient function of a house, as well as a design that’s creative and unique.
In any cases, three houses were built in Irwin’s time that used her hexagonal design. And in 1869, when she was 41, Irwin
became the first woman in the United States to receive a patent for an architectural design. And that speaks volumes if you
ask me.

Listen to a conversation between a student and a university employee.
Student
Hi. I am a little lost. Um, is this the housing maintenance office?
Employee
You found it. How can I help you?
Student
Oh, good. I have a quick question. Are we allowed to keep electric heaters in our rooms?
Employee
Actually, you are not. What’s going on? Your room cold?
Student
It’s freezing in my room. I think the heat went out or something.
Employee
Are you sure it’s out? Maybe it just got turned out too far.
Student
Oh, no. I tried adjusting the, uh, the heat control, but it doesn’t make any difference. It’s so cold in my bedroom I can’t sleep
at night. I’ve actually been sleeping on the sofa in the front room. The heat still works in there. Actually, we get hot air in all
the bedrooms except ours.
Employee
Wow! Do you have a roommate?
Student
Yeah. But she said she isn’t bothered by the cold. But on the sofa, I am kept up by the noise out in the hall. The dorms can
sometimes get pretty noisy. So what can be done about it?
Employee
Well, OK. There’s a couple of things we can do. I can have a custodian take a look at it and see if he can do something.
299Student
Actually, I asked the custodian yesterday to take a look. But he said he couldn’t find anything wrong. He said that some of
the other rooms have lost heat also and that if we’d come here you guys would fix it.
Employee
Oh, he did? That’s weird, because I would have…well, the custodians themselves are usually supposed to report any
problems right away. OK. In that case, then what you need to do is…here, fill out this form.
Student
I have to fill out a form?
Employee
Yeah, but at least that’ll put your heater problem in a work order for the maintenance crew and they’ll get to you as soon as
possible. Just so you know, because it’s not winter yet and it’s not as cold as it could be, it may take a few days for a
maintenance crew to get to you.
Student
A few days? I can’t even sleep in my own room! Can’t we just get an electric heater?
Employee
I am sorry. But students just aren’t allowed. OK. I can see that this is a problem, and not just with your room. So if you can
get the form back to me this afternoon, I’ll try to get a maintenance crew to look at your problem by tomorrow. How’s that?
Student
Oh, that would be great. Seriously. I have to take off now. But when I fill this form out, I give it to you, right?
Employee
Right. And if I am not here, just put it in my box and I’ll get it.
Lecture1 – Archaeology (The Great Pyramid)
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an archaeology class.
Professor
The Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt might be the most famous building in the world. We know exactly when it was built.
Construction started in 2547 B.C.E., about 4500 years ago. We know who had it built. That was the pharaoh Khufu. We
know who oversaw its construction—the pharaoh’s brother. We know so many things about it, but the funny thing is: we
still don’t know exactly how it was built.
This picture will give you an idea of the size of the Pyramid and the size of the blocks it’s made out of that. About two
million stone blocks were used to build the Great Pyramid and they are incredibly massive. The average weight is two and a
half tons. The problem that has puzzled scholars for centuries is how were these blocks lifted up the height of this massive structure
and then fit into place and without the benefit of modern technology. Of course, there’ve been a lot of theories over the
centuries.
The oldest recorded one is by the Greek historian Herodotus. He visited Egypt around 450 B.C.E., when the Pyramid was
already 2000 years old. His theory was that cranes were used, much like we use cranes today to construct tall buildings. And
Herodotus may have seen Egyptians using cranes made of wood. But the problem with this theory has to do with simple
mechanics. A crane needs a wide and sturdy base to stand on or it will fall over. Well, as you get toward the top of the
Pyramid, there’s really no place for a crane to stand. The stone blocks are too narrow to provide a base. Well, so much for
that theory.
300The next one has to do with the use of a ramp that would allow workers to drag a stone block up the side of the structure. Of
course the ramp can’t be too steep. It has to have a long gentle slope. And that’s the problem. If you build a ramp with a
slight slope up to the top of a Pyramid that’s over 130 meters high, it would have to be almost two kilometers long. Well, the
Pyramid is built on a flat area called the Giza Plateau. The Plateau is simply not big enough to accommodate a
two-kilometer-long ramp.
OK. So what now? Well, if you’ve ever driven on a mountain road, you’d know that it has a lot of twists and turns and
bends in it, because that’s how engineers keep the road from having to be too steep. So why not wrap the ramp around the
Pyramid? Building the ramp around it as you go. Sounds like a pretty good idea. Except it’s got a serious problem.
See…one of the most remarkable things about the Great Pyramid is how accurate the proportions are. The dimensions are
almost perfect. To get that perfection, the engineers must have had to measure it repeatedly during construction. And the
way you’d measure it is from the four corners of the base. Well, if you got a ramp spiraling up from the base of the Pyramid,
those corners would be buried by that ramp during construction.
Well, who says the ramp has to be on the outside of the Pyramid? And now we get to the latest idea. If the ramp were on the
inside of the Pyramid, the corners at the base would be exposed, so the engineers could do their measurements while they
were building.
Well, an architect named Houdin has spent a few years working on making computer models of the building of the Pyramid.
And what Houdin believes is that an exterior straight ramp was used to construct the bottom third of the Pyramid, this ramp
would have been fairly short. It probably rose less than 50 meters. Then the rest of the Pyramid was constructed using an
internal ramp that spiraled around the inside of the Pyramid.
But how can we test this idea? Well, there are several ways to look inside the Pyramid.
One is called microgravimetry. Microgravimetry is a technique that’s used to detect voids inside a structure. You can then
take the data and generate an image that shows any empty spaces in the interior. Well, in 1986, French scientists completed
a microgravimetric survey of the Pyramid. And one of the images they produced showed an empty spiral-shaped space
inside it. The shape of that space corresponds exactly to what Houdin thought the ramp would look like. I think Herodotus
would be convinced. We might very well be at the end of centuries of guessing.
Lecture2 – Environmental Science (Water Management)
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an environmental science class.
Professor
I’d like to continue with the topic of managing water resources, but I want to focus on a particular case. Uh, um, an example
of water management that’s made us reconsider the methods we use when we make these decisions. So let’s look at what’s
happening in the Colorado River basin.
The Colorado River basin is a region in the Southwest United States. Seven states rely on the Colorado’s water. And as you
can imagine, as the populations of these states began to grow, it became clear that a system to distribute, uh, to make sure
each state got its fair share of water…some kind of system had to be created. And in 1922, a water-sharing agreement was
made. Elizabeth, you have a question?
Student
Well, how exactly do you figure out how to share a river? I mean, you can’t…like cut it up into pieces.
Professor
Well, let’s start with the first step. And that’s trying to figure out how much water on average flows through the river each
year. Now, researchers had started gathering data on water flow back in the late 1890s using instruments they placed in the
river. When the 1922 water-sharing agreement was made, there were about twenty years of data on water flow available.
The average annual flow was calculated. And, well, the agreement was based on that calculation. The same basic agreement
is in effect today.
301Student
Wait! That was all the data they had? And they based their decision on that?
Professor
Yes. And we’ll why that was a bad decision in a moment. OK. As decades passed, it became clear that measuring river flow
was much more complicated than we had thought. See…a river has periods of low flow and periods of high flow. And this
wasn’t taken into consideration when the 1922 agreement was made. In the 1970s, the population of the area was rising
while the amount of water flowing through the river seemed to be falling. By this time, we had…what? A hundred years of
recorded data to look at? That’s still a pretty short time for an ancient river.
To get more data, we looked at a different source—a source that was able to tell us about hundreds of years of the river’s
history—tree rings. OK. Let me explain.
You probably know that we can determine a tree’s age by counting the rings on a cross section of its trunk. Each ring
represents one year of the tree’s life. So if you know the year the tree was cut, you can count inwards and date each ring all
the way back to the center. You can also tell how much moisture the tree got during each of those years by looking at the
width of the rings. A wide ring means plenty of water while a narrow one indicates less.
Fortunately for us, certain areas of the Colorado River basin are home to some very old trees, some 800 years old and older.
Researchers can drill core samples, uh, basically get a cross section of a tree without having to kill it, look at the rings and
get a picture of what the climate was like in the basin for each of the tree’s years.
Well, the results tell us something we wouldn’t have known without this data, that over the past 500 years or so, the
Colorado River basin has experienced severe droughts, some worse than any we’ve ever recorded. They also showed that
the early to mid-1900s, when most of the data that led to the water-sharing agreement was collected…well, this was the
wettest period in the past 400 years. Well, obviously, had water management officials known then what we know now, the
1922 agreement would have been handled differently.
But today we can use the past to help prepare us for the future. With the demand for water in the basin stays increasing and
with the real likelihood of lower flows in the river, if history is our teacher, we can develop innovative methods of water
conservation and reevaluate how water is distributed.
Conversation2
Narrator
Listen to a conversation between a student and his biology professor.
Student
Professor Landrea.
Professor
Hi, Dennis. You are right on time. Come on in and have a seat.
Student
Great! Thanks.
Professor
So like I told you in class, I just wanted to take a few minutes to meet with everyone to make sure your class presentations
for next week are all in order and coming along well. And as you know, you are supposed to report on some area of recent
research in genetics, something…you know…original.
Student
Well, I think I found just the thing! It actually occurred to me a couple nights ago while I was eating dinner in the cafeteria.
Tell me professor, do you like broccoli?
Professor
302Broccoli? You mean the vegetable broccoli?
Student
Yeah.
Professor
Well, I guess not really.
Student
Me neither. I have never liked it or most other vegetables for that matter…Brussels sprouts, asparagus, cauliflower…you
name it. They just taste bitter and…well…nasty to me. My mother always called me a picky eater.
Professor
OK…And?
Student
And so I got to wondering: I mean, I am obviously not the only person like this. So is this just because of some…like
trauma from our childhoods? Some bad experience we’ve had with some vegetables? Or could there be some genetic
explanation for why some people are picky eaters and others aren’t?
Professor
OK. I see. Well, I suppose it’s a possibility.
Student
Actually, it turns out it’s more than a possibility. I started doing some research in the library that night and I found out that a
biologist at the National Institutes of Health has been looking at that very question recently.
Professor
Well, I guess that’s not too surprising. And this is great stuff actually. So what’s the verdict?
Student
Well, this guy seems to have discovered a particular gene that actually makes it possible for people to taste the bitterness in
certain green vegetables. But people who have a mutation in that gene cannot taste the bitterness.
Professor
Well…that’s certainly fascinating! But…so this biologist is basically claiming that people who like to eat these vegetables
actually have some sort of sensory deficit? Sort of makes us picky eaters than normal ones, doesn’t it? I mean, that’s kind of
turning things on their head, isn’t it?
Student
Well…then again, it wouldn’t be the first time, would it? Think of it this way: humans originally needed to have a stronger
sensitivity to bitter-tasting foods so they could learn what plants were good for them and which ones might be poisonous.
But at some point, as people figured out what they could safely eat, this need became less crucial and a segment of the
population lost that ability.
Professor
OK. Well, you make a compelling case. I can’t wait to hear more about this when you deliver your report.
Lecture3 – Biology (Notothenioids)
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a biology class.
Professor
Ways in which animals adapt to their environment are often quite ingenious actually. And as an example of this, let me tell
you about a fish, a group of fish known as the Notothenioids. There’s over 90 known species of Notothenioids and they
inhabit both shallow and very deep waters, mostly around Antarctica. Many are fairly small, though the largest species can
weigh up to 150 kilograms.
303Notothenioids can be identified by their large eyes, which are covered by a thick insulating layer of clear tissue. This tissue
protects their eyes from freezing. Remember, the freezing point of ocean water, salt water, is lower than for fresh water,
negative 1.9 degree Celsius (-1.9°C). So it can get a lot colder for fish in an ocean, say, than in a river or lake. So this means
that the ocean waters around Antarctica are cold enough to freeze most types of fish, but Notothenioids don’t freeze. In fact, they thrive. They account for some 95% of all fish in the southern ocean, the ocean that surrounds Antarctica.
So, how unusual is that? To have a single family of fish dominating an entire ocean. I mean, think of…say, tropical or
temperate marine environments, which have incredibly diverse fish populations. Coral reefs, for example, support over
4000 types of fish, along with sponges, crustaceans, and many other organisms.
So, exactly when and how did the Notothenioids come to dominate the southern ocean?
Well, around 30 million years ago, the waters around Antarctica were a lot warmer than they are today. Um...at that time,
Antarctica was connected to South America, which means that warm air from the north could flow southward and heat up
the Antarctica waters. Because the water around Antarctica then was relatively warm, it supported many types of fish. And
we know this from fossil evidence.
But the 90 or so species of Notothenioids that exist today didn’t exist at all back then. In fact, only one ancestral
Notothenioid species existed. But somewhere between 5 million and 14 million years ago, two major changes took place.
First, what we call a chance mutation. A tiny genetic change occurred in that one Notothenioid species. Its DNA allowed for
the production of a special protein, a protein that prevents the fish from freezing. The way this…this anti-freeze protein
works is: it binds to any ice crystals that form inside the fish. This binding action prevents the ice crystals from growing
larger. And this is what prevents Notothenioids from freezing.
Now, at that time, the waters the Notothenioids inhabited were still not freezing cold, so the protein didn’t really make a
difference as far as the fish’s survival. But this would change, because in the same period of geologic time there was a shift
in the earth’s continental plates. Continental drift caused Antarctica to move apart from the landmass of South America and
to drift into the Southern Polar Region. This resulted in a powerful water current encircling Antarctica, which prevented the
Antarctic waters from mixing with warmer water. So the southern ocean, isolated from that warm airflow from the north,
cooled down drastically, to the kinds of sub-freezing temperatures we associate with it today.
Now, most fish species couldn’t survive in this frigid environment and they became extinct. But that one Notothenioid
species, with its unique ability to produce that anti-freeze protein, thrived. It had virtually the entire southern ocean to itself!
So? Well, there was little or no competition for food or space. You might think of it as…um…as a…a kind of ecological
vacuum. And the Notothenioids exploited fully. The species migrated into different habitats throughout the southern ocean.
And its population increased dramatically, with various sub-populations migrating into different parts of the ocean. Over
time these sub-populations in all those different habitats…well, they developed very different physical traits. They adapted
to survive in their particular ecological niche, their…their position within a particular ecosystem.
We call this type of species diversification within a species adaptive radiation. And what adaptive radiation is is: an
evolutionary process by which a parent species rapidly undergoes changes resulting in various new species in order to fill
multiple ecological niches. So in the case of the Notothenioids, that single species started colonizing empty habitats to such
an extent that it evolved into a broad range of new species, the 90 or so Notothenioid species that we have today. So let me
switch to adaptive radiation with regard to another species that’s also been very successful.
Lecture4 – Art History (Renaissance Gardens)
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an art history class.
Professor
OK. We have been talking about the art and architecture of the Italian Renaissance, from around A.D. 1400 to around A.D.
1600. Last class, we had a look at some of the magnificent palaces and villas built during this time period. And just as class
304was ending, someone asked about the gardens associated with these palaces and villas. And so I’d like to say a few things
about them before we move on.
Now, when I say gardens, I don’t mean vegetable gardens or simple flower gardens. These were lavishly constructed, finely
detailed gardens that covered hundreds of acres, with exotic plants and ornamental statues. And they were just as much a
symbol of their owners’ social position as their palaces and villas were. Again, what was the inspiration for the Renaissance?
Rebecca.
Student
Classical art and architecture of the ancient Greeks and Romans.
Professor
That’s right. As we’ve said before, the main point of the Renaissance was to revive the genius of the ancient Greeks and
Romans, which is why designers of Renaissance gardens designed them as the ancient Romans would have designed them,
or at least as they imagined the ancient Romans would have designed them.
Student
How did they know what ancient Roman gardens look like?
Professor
Well, they didn’t have any pictures. But they did have some very detailed descriptions of ancient Roman villas and their
gardens that had been written by famous Roman authors who lived during the height of the Roman Empire. And at least
three of those authors, one was a scholar, one was a poet, and one was lawyer, were very authoritative, very reliable sources.
Ah…and interestingly enough, there was another source that didn’t describe classical gardens but still became a great
influence on Renaissance gardens. It was also written back during the height of the Roman Empire by a mathematician
known as Hero of Alexandria. Hero was a Greek. But he lived in Alexandria, Egypt, which was at the time part of the
Roman Empire. Hero compiled descriptions and sketches of seventy some clever little mechanical devices, most of which
utilized compressed air to cause water, or in some cases wine, to flow from one place to another, or sometimes to squirt or
to make some kind of noise. Yes? John?
Student
Could you give an example?
Professor
Well, one of the devices was a sacrificial vessel that was obviously designed for a temple, not for a garden. Anyway, if you
drop money into this vessel, water would flow out of it. Well, creative minds in the Renaissance realized that this little
device could be nicely repurposed as a nifty little fountain. Designers of Renaissance gardens loved this sort of thing. They
loved to incorporate novelties and tricks, things to amuse and impress guests.
Student
And that was the purpose? To impress people?
Professor
Sure. As a nobleman or wealthy landowner, one purpose of having a fabulous villa with a fantastic garden was to impress
people. It was a way of proving your social position.
Student
Well…OK. You also mentioned tricks.
Professor
Well, for example, some gardens had plaster or marble birds that sang when water flowed through them. Some fountains
were designed to squirt people with water.
Student
And these things were popular?
Professor
Yes. They may have been the most popular features of the gardens. I mean, flowers and statues can be nice to look at, but
these things were a lot more fun. And the more clever the device is, the more famous the garden and the greater prestige the
landowner enjoyed. Yes? Rebecca.
305Student
What about mazes? I read that they were a major part of the Renaissance gardens.
Professor
Oh, yes. They certainly were! Mazes or labyrinths, as they’re also called, were very common in Renaissance gardens. How
that came to be though is a bit of a mystery. Mazes have a long history going back to the ancient Egyptians, but they started
appearing in gardens only during the Renaissance, or perhaps just a little bit prior to that. According to one source, what
happened was: in the late 1400s, a highly respected expert published a book on architecture. And readers somehow
mistakenly inferred from that book that ancient Romans had mazes in their gardens. So then designers of Renaissance
gardens thinking they were following in the footsteps of the ancient Romans…well…guess what they did.

Narrator
Listen to a conversation between a student and an employee in the university library.
Librarian
Ready to check out?
Student
Just about. Before I do though, this book on early navigation…I have been using this book quite a bit for a research project. And I would like to own it actually. And well…it’s an old book, and there were two copies on the shelf just now, so I was
wondering if I could buy one. I was talking to this guy the other day, and he said the library sold books on occasion. Is that
right?
Librarian
He is probably talking about our annual book sale. We have one every spring.
Student
OK. How do you decide which books to sell? Are they duplicates?
Librarian
A lot are duplicates. If we have more than one copy of a title and it hasn’t been checked out in a few years, in that case it
might end up at the sale.
Student
I’ve actually tried to find this book online but no luck so far. I was really hoping to buy it.
Librarian
Well, that particular book…well, it probably won’t be up for sale this year. Most books in the sale come from off-site
storage.
Student
Off-site storage?
Librarian
That’s where we keep books that haven’t been used for several years. They are still in the catalog, which means they can be
checked out if you fill out a form. It takes maybe a day or two to retrieve one of them.
Student
I see.
Librarian
306And then before we decide to include a book in the sale, we review its circulation history again, which can take a while.
We’ve got a lot of books in storage.
Student
So it’s basically the unpopular books that get put up for sale then?
Librarian
Well, that…plus the main thing is to make sure students have access to the information in the books. A lot of them are
available in electronic format these days, even the really old ones. You know, they have been preserved that way.
Student
So most of the books for sale are older books.
Librarian
Well, we get book donations too. And lots of those are new. Again, a librarian reviews them and decides whether to
catalogue them or put them up for sale.
Student
Is this sale open to the public?
Librarian
On the second day. It’s a two-day sale. The first day is for students, faculty and staff though, which is great. We usually need
about twenty volunteers for the sale. And well, if you volunteer, you get first shot at everything in advance.
Student
Really? What do volunteers have to do?
Librarian
You help sort the books and set up the tables. But keep in mind those positions fill up quickly.
Now, about this particular book, it wouldn’t hurt to send a formal request to the collection department. They might be able
to let you know if it would be up for sale.
Student
I’ll do that. Thanks.
Lecture1-Art History (Dadaism)
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an art history class.
Professor
All right. So last week we started talking about the painters and sculptors who were part of the art movement called Dada.
But I don’t want you to think the ideas we introduced last time were limited to painting, sculpture, that sort of thing. So
today I want to move beyond the visual arts and talk a bit about Dada in the performing arts, in theater.
But let’s start by reviewing what Dada is. OK? As you will recall, Dada began in Switzerland, in the city of Zurich, in 1916.
The artists who studied it were reacting against traditional notions of beauty, of reason, of progress, which had been
standards of western thought since the 18th century. They looked around. And well, I mean, the First World War was raging,
so they didn’t see much beauty, reason or progress in the world. Instead, they saw a world that was chaotic, random, a world
that didn’t make sense. And if that’s the way the world was, well, they wanted their art to reflect that.
So let’s…let’s review a couple of key ideas that were the backbone of Dada art.
First, the Dadaists wanted to completely reject the classical idea of art. Classical ideas like proportion, balance…all the
307things you think about when you think about great art. Great art involved reason, the logic, the beauty that the Dadaists
wanted to overthrow.
So, well, you know, to a Dadaist, classical artwork was a reflection of outdated thinking! That’s why Dadaists created
sculptures like the ones we saw last week. Remember the stool with the bicycle wheel mounted on top? I wouldn’t exactly
called that beautiful, would you? But of course it wasn’t meant to be. That was the point!
OK.
So another key Dada idea we talked about was the embracing of randomness. Right? Uh…if life is random, said the
Dadaists, why would we make art that has order and logic? And so we have that collage we looked at, with an artist took
different, you know, cut-out squares of colored paper, threw them onto the canvas, and wherever they landed, that was the
composition of the work! The above text is a transcript of this lecture prepared by lady&bird (QQ5l9626928).
Another favorite of the Dadaists was something called chance poetry. A chance poet would pull words out of a hat and that
would be…that would make up the poem! And this idea of chance and randomness was a key element of Dadaism because
the whole world seemed so random to them.
So now let’s take a look at how Dadaist ideas represented to audiences in highly unconventional…well…I am not even sure
how to categorize these theatrical events. I suppose you just have to call them shows. These shows started in Zurich in a
place called the Cabaret Voltaire.
The rejection of classical western art, well, you see this in the nature of what took place at the Cabaret Voltaire. They didn’t
put on plays or operas there. What they did was throw out all conventions.
They mixed everything and anything together. They would…it might start with somebody reading a poem. Then somebody
else playing an instrument, followed by a display of paintings, followed by somebody else chanting, followed by somebody
else banging on a big drum, and someone dressed in a robot costume jumping up and down. So it’s not like a play. There’s
no real plot development here like you’d find in the traditional theatrical performance.
The performers at the Cabaret Voltaire would also get the audience involved, which was extremely unusual. Think about a
traditional play. The action’s self-contained. The actors act as if there is no one watching, right? It’s like a world unto itself.
Well, at the Cabaret Voltaire, audience members could get up on stage and dance, or chant, or shout and sing from their
seats.
And every night would be different, because there would be a different audience and a different set of acts and displays.
So all these could get pretty chaotic. No barriers between the performers and the audience, and no barriers between kinds of
art either. Think about it: poetry, paintings, music, dance…all on the same stage and often at the same time!
This is what the Dadaists had in mind. When they set out to make art that reflected their own idea of reality, it didn’t make
sense. But why should it?!
Lecture2-Environmental Engineering (APS digestion)
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in an environmental engineering class.
Professor
At the end of yesterday’s class, we were discussing landfills and the hundreds of millions of tons of everyday garbage which
are deposited into them each year in the United States. It’s a growing problem! Quite simply, we are running out of space to
put our garbage. And this is especially true for solid organic waste: food scraps from home or food processing plants, waste
from farms, that sort of thing. Did you know that two thirds of the waste sitting in our landfills is organic material? We have
government recycling programs for materials like plastics, glass and metal, yet widespread solutions for organic waste
materials haven’t really been addressed in the United States. I think this is just asking for trouble in the future.
So today I want to talk about a technology that offers a potential solution to the problem—Anaerobic Phased Solids
digestion, or APS digestion.
First of all, what does anaerobic mean? Anyone?
308Student
Without oxygen?
Professor
Correct! APS digestion uses anaerobic bacteria, ones that thrive in the absence of oxygen, to consume, to break down
organic material.
Student
Excuse me. Professor. Um…those anaerobic bacteria you are talking about…well, aren’t anaerobic bacteria also used in
waste water treatment plants?
Professor
Yes. They are. Would you like to explain this to the class?
Student
Sure! So when waste water is treated, one of the byproducts is a thick liquid called sludge. And aren’t anaerobic bacteria
used to break down the sludge?
Professor
That’s right. Anaerobic bacteria have been used in waste water treatment for decades.
Student
So how is this technology different?
Professor
Good question. The anaerobic digestion systems used in waste water plants are designed to treat sludge, not solids. Now, in
the past, researchers have attempted to treat solid organic waste with that same equipment.
But there was always a problem.
In order to process the solid waste, the kind we find in landfills, you had to pretreat the solids to turn them into sludge.
First, by breaking the material apart mechanically into small particles and then adding a lot of water until you got a kind of
thick, soupy mix that the equipment could handle. But that extra step took time and required a lot of energy.
Student
That sounds like it would cost a lot.
Professor
That’s right. But APS digestion is designed specifically to handle solid waste. So it is much more cost-effective.
The new technology processes organic waste in two phases. Remember, APS stands for Anaerobic Phased Solids digestion.
First, the waste material is loaded into a large, closed container, along with different types of anaerobic bacteria. The
bacteria break the solids down into acids and hydrogen gas. The hydrogen is extracted and the remaining acids are
transferred into a different container for the second phase of the process. There another type of bacteria converts the acids
into methane gas.
Student
Aren’t hydrogen and methane gas bad for the environment though?
Professor
The answer in this case is no, because they don’t escape into the atmosphere. The gases are captured and can be burned to
produce electricity, which saves a lot of money and ultimately decreases our need for fuels like petroleum and coal, which
are not only expensive but are also polluting.
Student
So organic waste from landfills could be processed this way?
Professor
It is certainly one possibility. And APS digestion systems are very versatile. They can be installed just about anywhere. See,
anaerobic digestion systems used at waste water treatment plants are huge tanks that hold thousands of gallons of waste
water. But the APS containers are small enough to be set up on site, where the waste is generated, like at food processing
plants or on farms. So garbage doesn’t have to be transported long distances. As a matter of fact, a couple of universities
successfully set up demonstration projects. They collected food scraps from dining halls and local restaurants and process
them in APS facilities. Not only did the university save money, we are also learning even more about the APS process.
309What is the next step forward?
Well, APS digestion uses several different types of anaerobic bacteria, right? So what are the most efficient bacteria in the
process? If researchers can figure that out, the highest performing bacteria mix for a system could be determined. Ultimately
the goal would be to grow enough of these particular bacteria to support large-scale commercial APS systems.
Conversation2
Narrator
Listen to a conversation between a student and her creative writing professor.
Student
Hello. Professor Thomson. Could I talk to you for a minute?
Professor
Oh. Hi. Laura. We missed you last class.
Student
Yeah. I was sick for a few days. Um…I was wondering...did I miss a lot of work?
Professor
Let’s see…well, we discussed the story that you have been assigned to read for class. A Memory by Eudora Welty. And then
we listened to a recording of an interview with Welty. The recording is on reserve at the library. You’ll need to listen to it.
So…did you have a chance to read the story?
Student
Yeah. I did.
Professor
What did you think?
Student
Well…I was a little surprised. I mean, the first time I read it anyway.
Professor
What surprised you?
Student
You know, it just seemed like there was nothing going on in the story. I mean, a girl is just sitting at the beach thinking
about one of her memories. And at the same time, she is watching other bathers on the beach, and sort of just thinking about
what they are doing too. And that’s all that happens! So at the end of the story, I thought, that’s it?!
Professor
I know what you mean. There’s no surprise ending like in O. Henry’s story The Gift of the Magi or some big adventure like
in Faulkner’s The Bear.
So you didn’t like the story?
Student
Well, actually, while I was reading it the second time, I sort of realized that you don’t need surprises or excitement to have a
great story. . The girl’s memory and the stuff she was thinking about while she was watching the other people on the beach
were really interesting to read about. And you know, it made me think that when I write my story, the one we have to write
for this class, I can maybe use my own memories to get me started.
Professor
Well, in fact, I’d hoped you’d see that. Of course, there are many levels to the story. But what I really wanted the class to
take away from it was that you don’t need to write about the great exciting world when you write you stories. Even writing
310about a memory can work.
Student
Like I could write about one of the times I took a walk in the woods when I was a kid.
Professor
Exactly! You know, as the due day of your stories approaches, I am hearing from a lot of students that they are worried
because they don’t have anything exciting enough to write about. But Welty said in the interview we listened to and in her
autobiography that her worst stories were the ones where she tried to write about people or places that were unfamiliar to
her. That’s why a lot of her stories are set in Mississippi, where she is from. Welty stressed that, for her anyway, familiarity
with her subject matter was the key to a successful story.
Student
Familiarity. That makes sense. Thanks Professor Thomson.
Professor
No problem. Now, don’t forget to listen to that recording.
Lecture3-Botany (Plants and Pollinators)
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a botany class.
Professor
When we talk about pollination ecology, we are talking about the relationship between a plant and its pollinator. From the
plants’ perspective, the ideal pollinator is an animal that is under-fed, ready to eat and in a hurry. The pollinator, on the other
hand, wants to remain well-fed with as little effort as possible. These factors help drive the evolution of plants and their
pollinators, both of which depend on this balanced and delicate relationship. Sometimes only certain insects or birds can
pollinate certain plant species. So to really understand pollination ecology, both the flower and its pollinators must be
studied.
Let’s start with flowers.
There are several important factors associated with pollination: when and how often a plan flowers, how long the flowering
cycle lasts, and the number of flowers that open at the same time. For example, flowering may coincide with the migration
of a certain animal species that pollinates the plant, or producing many flowers at once may increase the number of
pollinators a plant attracts.
Other characteristics of flowers are also important. Features such as color, scent and shape attract pollinators, as does the
reward in the flower, the pollen or the nectar, that feeds the pollinator. For example, flowers that attract bats tend to be green
or cream-colored, because visibility is important. Bats are practically blind, remember. And these flowers bloom at night
when bats are active.
Now, there’s a flower in the Amazon rainforest called a royal water lily and the characteristics of its flowers change during
the pollination process. The royal water lily uses color, temperature and scent to attract the beetles that pollinate it. When
the flowers of the royal water lily first open up, when they first bloom, they are white. They also emit a strong odor and
their temperature rises. Producing heat serves two purposes. It magnifies the scent of the flower and it helps the beetles
maintain their body temperature. When a beetle arrives at the flower, the flower closes around it for about 24 hours so that
the beetle becomes covered with pollen. Then when the flower opens, its color changes to red and it cools down. When the
beetle flies out, it carries the pollen to a different, heated, white, fragrant flower.
As you can see, plants go to a lot of trouble to attract attention. So what kind of attention are they attracting? And why?
Well, sometimes flowers provide shelter for insects, a place to lay eggs for instance. But usually the attraction is food:
nectar and pollen. Nectar is mainly a sugar solution, while pollen is a grain made up of part of the plant’s cell structure. In
both nectar and pollen production, quality and quantity vary over time. But they are always related to the needs of the
311pollinator.
You can see that the relationship between pollinators and plants are delicate, so any number of factors can disturb them. Human development is one. And agriculture is generally believed to be the most harmful. It can fragment habitats in a
variety of ways, reducing the number of pollinators, which in turn may reduce the number or size of the flowers, which of
course affects the animals that feed on them. Exotic plant species not native to the area can move in and compete. Even bees
brought in to pollinate crops can alter natural pollen dispersal systems of rainforest plants.
On the other hand, recent studies have shown that the disruption of one aspect of the pollination cycle doesn’t usually lead
to the extinction of other species. It turns out that plant-pollinator relationships are more adaptable to change than we
thought. So really it is hard to know just how agriculture affects the pollination of plants.
Lecture4-Business Management (The Life Cycle of Innovation)
Narrator
Listen to part of a discussion in a business management class.
Professor
Last week we were talking about innovation in business. Remember the graph I showed you?
Student
The curve that looked sort of like the letter S?
Professor
Right. Cathy. Let’s take another look. Do you recall? Cathy. How this S-curve represents the life cycle of innovation?
Student
Sure. Starting on the left, the new innovation, let’s say it’s a new product. Almost nobody’s heard of it or at least nobody
takes it seriously. Then its popularity increases, uh, slowly at first till sales really start accelerating quickly. They are where
the line goes up steeply in the middle as more and more get excited about the product and they go out and buy it. But
eventually, moving over to the right side there, interest begins to fade and the growth and sales levels off.
Professor
At which point the market has matured for that product. We can still sell it and even marginally improve it, but it’s not new
anymore. It no longer offers exciting growth opportunities. So a business leader might face a choice: either stick with this
old, safe, proven idea or move on to the next big idea, a fresh innovation. But innovations are risky. They may succeed or
they may not.
OK. A case study.
George. I have heard your Thursday night program on the campus radio station. You like Jazz, right?
Student
Huh?! Uh…yeah…sure! But…what?!
Professor
OK. Stay with me here. On your program last week, I heard an old Miles Davis album. Tell us about that.
Student
Uh…Miles Davis. Trumpet. I played a CD of a Jazz classic he recorded in the 1950s called Kind of Blue. It’s my all-time
favorite Jazz recording.
Professor
Mine too. Would you call that recording innovative for its time?
Student
Absolutely! Nothing at all like what he had recorded up till then. I mean, before that Miles Davis played things so complex
that…well…nobody could touch him. But this was something totally new. Suddenly his playing sounded so amazingly
simple.
Professor
312And how did people react to this new sound of Miles Davis?
Student
Well…some were disappointed, even angry that he’d abandon his old style. But soon most of his fans came around and this
new style appealed to a whole new group of jazz listeners.
Professor
I guess so. Kind of Blue became the most commercially successful album in the history of jazz! So is there a lesson here
anyone? Think of that S-curve I showed you.
Student
Oh! So his old style of jazz was actually a kind of product, one that had been developed pretty thoroughly. And he’d taken it
about as far as he could. So he decided to take a big risk and try something totally new.
Professor
Exactly! Something completely fresh and cool. And people couldn’t get enough of it. It was a brand new beginning that left
lots of room for further development artistically. And as a market analyst, you could say that with Kind of Blue, he was
jumping to the beginning of a brand new S-curve! With all that potential for profitable development still ahead of him.
But let me ask you something else. This isn’t just the music of a single performer, is it? George.
Student
Hardly. More like a group of all-stars. Along with Miles Davis on trumpet, there is Bill Evans on piano, John Coltrane on
tenor saxophone…
Professor
Individually perhaps the best in the business. But thinking of Miles Davis as the leader of this group, how did he organize
and manage all these incredible talent?
Student
Well, he’d lay out the general outline, the theme and then give each of these star performers, one by one, the creative
freedom to really show what they could do with it on their own instrument, to improvise and add something new, but always
within the same general theme.
Professor
So Miles Davis gets credit for recruiting the best jazz talent anywhere and getting them to collaborate on a fantastic musical
product.
Everyone see the business parallels here?
And give each of these musicians credit for seizing this opportunity and creating great individual performances.
But good jazz is more than just individual performance, isn’t it?
Student
Definitely. Jazz musicians need to listen to each other and go with the flow. Like, one time somebody goofed and came in a
little early, but everyone else adjusted and went right along with it, as if nothing were wrong. And this mistake came out like
just another unexpected creative interpretation.
Professor
Thanks. George. Great insights, ones that would certainly apply to what we are studying here.

TPO 35-Conversion 1 (Part-Time Position)
Narrator:Listen to a conversation between a student and a counselor.
Student: Hi, I'm Tina Molly.Employee:Oh, Tina, yeah, good to meet you!You told me on the phone that you are
looking for a part-time position?
Student:Yeah! My roommate works at the dining hall, and she heard a part-time job might be opening up there for
this new semester. So I was hoping...
Employee:There was one, but that got filled a couple days ago.
Student:Oh, no! Really? The thing is I've got to do something to pay for expenses. And, well, I'm not afraid of hard
work.
Employee:I guess not. You see, I always have to check the class schedules of potential applicants to make sure they
are full time students in good standing. And your schedule this past semester, I mean, everything from computer
science, to African history, to zoology and physics. How do you manage with such a heavy class load?
Student:Pretty well! Actually. If I do get a job, of course, I may have to cut back to a more normal schedule. But,
you know, there're so many great subjects to learn about.
Employee: Ah, a generalist.
Student:Yeah! It's gonna be hard for me to pick just one thing to specialize in.
Employee:Say, that gives me an idea. You're pretty comfortable on a computer, right? With learning new software
applications?
Student:Sure! I'm pretty good at that. Why?
Employee:Well, last week I got a call from the folks over at the visualization project. They wanna add a couple parttimers to their staff.
Student:Visualization project?
Employee:Yes, they help professors from all different departments turn information into something their students
can see. You know, instead of just writing on a black board, more and more professors want to project information
onto a screen. And how do I say this? Some professors are really good in their own subject areas, but when it comes
to computers, well...
Student:I get the picture. So they use the visualization project to create what? Like graphs of different sorts?
Employee:Graphs of economic trends for instance or population growth. And sometimes dynamic maps, maps that
change on screen to show for instance how trade ebbed and flowed over the centuries along various routes between
China and the Mediterranean.
Student:Wow, that'd be interesting.
Employee:Yeah! And that's just what they do for classroom lectures. A project staffer might also be asked for to
help professors pool together some of their research data and model that visually. They claim that putting their
research in a map, for example, or a moving image helps them see connections, new relationships in data on, say,
animal migration patterns that they might miss if they're just looking numbers on a piece of paper.
Student:That's terrific! What about working hours?
Employee:They are pretty flexible. Staffers can go in to work day or night. They just have to make sure it's all done
by the time the professor needs it. So shall I give you the number to call to get in touch with these people?
Student:Oh, would you? To think I came in just hoping to get something in the dining hall.

TPO 35-Lecture 1 (Animal Navigation System)
Narrator:Listen to part of a lecture in an animal behavior class.
Professor:Before we leave the topic of animal navigation, let's look at one more species and how it finds its way through
its environment.
The species we'll look at is the blind mole rat.
Blind mole rats are interesting in terms of navigation because they live entirely in the dark-in elaborate underground
tunnel systems. So how do blind mole rats find their way around in these complicated tunnels?
Well, for some time we've known that blind mole rats use some combination of two different navigation systems.
Um, one system relies on their sense of time and their ability to remember underground landmarks. For example, let's say
a mole rat wants to find its way through its tunnel system back to its nest where it sleeps. Well, it goes along. Then it feels
some hard stones or a tree root under its feet and it basically says to itself. 'Ok, here is where I took a left.' And then it
might remember how long it took to get to the next turn and so forth. The mole rat goes straight or turns based on what it
remembers having sensed along the way on previous trips and the time it took between turns.
Now, the other navigation system for the mole rat relies on Earth's magnetic field. Mole rats have the ability to sense the
magnetic field and use it to orient themselves directionally. But until recently scientists weren't sure about the role of
these two different systems.
Recently a team of researchers conducted an experiment to answer that question. Do these two navigation systems play
different roles? What they did was they designed a special structure that very closely resembles a blind mole rat's tunnel
system, which looks like a bicycle wheel, a central hub with multiple spokes radiating outward.
Now this turned out to be quite important. Earlier experiments have used a more generic habitat, basically a wide open
circle, which was originally designed to test magnetic navigation in other animals. That design led to inconclusive results
with mole rats.
Now, with their bicycle wheel tunnel system the researchers were able to vary the distance that the mole rats travel
between their nest and their food source by creating long routes and short routes. In each trial, the mole rats started out in
their nest, went to the food source and then had to find their way back home, back to the nest.
To determine which navigation system they were using, the researchers tested the animals under two different conditions.
First, the mole rats were tested under conditions of normal magnetism for both the trip to the food and the trip home. And
under these normal conditions, they all followed their original route back home, regardless of the length of the trip to the
food source.
Then in the second part of the experiment, the magnetic field was altered but only for the trip home, a specially
constructed set of magnets was used to shift the magnetic field around the habitat 19 degrees eastward. The researchers
wanted to see how the mole rats responded to this shift. Well, it turns out that the magnetic shift had no impact on the
return route of the blind mole rats after a short trip. They returned to the point where they had started from.
But after a longer trip, they took a totally different route: one that led them nine degrees east of the nest. Essentially they
got lost. This was strong evidence that blind mole rats use magnetic navigation only for longer trips.
So why two navigation systems: one for long trips and one for short trips?
Well, for now we can only speculate, but we think that when mole rats rely on the first system, using underground
landmarks or their sense of time, well, they make small mistakes here and there. On a short trip, this doesn't matter
much. The trip is short, so they can't make many mistakes.
But on a long trip, well, there are lots of opportunities to make small mistakes, and small mistakes can add up, leading the
mole rat far from where it wants to be. So on a long trip, a magnetic navigation system is better, more useful, since earth's
magnetic field is stable, a constant, a more reliable indicator of direction!

TPO 35-Lecture 2 (Earliest Permanent Settlement)
Narrator:Listen to part of a lecture in an archaeology class.
Professor:One of the frustrating things about archaeology, especially for beginning students, is that theories are
constantly evolving. A theory that's been accepted for many years may suddenly be called into question.
Student:But why would that happen?
Professor:There are probably a number of reasons. Earlier finds are always being reexamined in the context of new
finds. Or it may just be that someone looks at the evidence in a different way, has a different idea of what it
suggests.
Take the theory about the earliest permanent settlements. They were found in an area to the east of the
Mediterranean Sea called the Levant. And the people who lived there were the Natufians.
For quite some time, it's been widely accepted that about 15,000 years ago, the Natufians developed a sedentary
lifestyle. Can someone remind us what that means?
Student:It means that they stopped being nomadic, that they began staying in one area year round instead of moving
around all the time.
Professor:Right. And we think there was an abundance of edible plants and animals in the area at that time that make
this shift away from a nomadic lifestyle possible. Uh...keep in mind that the Natufians were hunter-gatherers. So in
spite of other changes, they were always a pre- agricultural society.
Anyway, after being sedentary for around 2,000 years, something happened that forced the Natufians to change their
lifestyle. The general consensus is that there was a period of climatic cooling, which had a negative effect on the
availability of food. And this food shortage likely caused the Natufians to revert to a nomadic lifestyle. Then around
11,500 years ago, the climate warmed again. Food became more abundant and the people in that area became
sedentary again.
Now, no one is contesting that these people, probably descendants of the Natufians, were indeed sedentary by
11,500 years ago. The evidence is quite strong. Archaeologists have uncovered numerous circular structures dating
from that period that appear to have been used to store grain. We think this for a couple of reasons.
First, the remains of barley houses have been found inside them. Barley was the main type of grain that grew in this
area.
And secondly, the floors on these structures were elevated. This design would have been consistent with the need to
keep the barley dry and safe from rodents. So, that makes sense.
And there are lots of these structures in the settlements. In one settlement that was only partially excavated,
archaeologists have already found four of these structures.
Student:So it's the earlier part, that the Natufians were sedentary 15,000 years ago, that's changed?
Professor:Well, there's evidence, but some archaeologists have questioned the criteria used to identify permanent
settlements.
See, circular structures have also been found in early Natufian settlements, so archaeologists believe that these were
also food storage structures based on their physical similarity to the structures in later settlements. And they would
indicate that the Natufians were sedentary 15,000 years ago.
But now, there are doubts about the use of these earlier structures.
Researchers point to the lack of grain remnants in these earlier structures. In fact, things other than grains have been
found in them. So at the very least, they say, these structures probably had multiple purposes.
And another problem they point to is that most early settlements have only one of these so-called storage
structures. But do you think one structure would be enough to hold the surplus for an entire settlement?
)
Student:Well, whatever these structures were used for, couldn't they just have built them at a place they came back
to regularly? Maybe to store things for their next visit?
Professor:Exactly! So-called base camps, where the Natufians didn't stay all year round.
But artifacts that were found at a number of Natufian sites seem to present evidence of a sedentary way of life. Large
heavy mortars, the sort of thing that would have been used for grinding grain. Such heavy equipment could indicate
that the Natufians would have stayed permanently in one place since the work involved in moving an item like this
around constantly would have been substantial.
But this evidence of sedentism has also been called into question because the materials used to make the stone
mortars did originally come from quite a distance. And if the Natufians could move the materials over great
distances...
TPO 35-Conversion 2 (Source Material Of The Paper)
Narrator: Listen to a conversation between a student and his European History Professor.
Professor: So I wanted to talk about your outline. I do like your topic: William, the conqueror, leading the Norman invasion of
England. But I'm a little concerned about your source and the fact that you want to use it as the entire basis of your paper.
Student: Really? The Bayeux tapestry? I thought it was pretty creative to use something that was made to hang on a wall as a
source. And as far as I know it's the most important documentation of the invasion, a first-hand account, right?
Professor: Well, you are right. It's considered a primary source. And at 70 meters long, the tapestry certainly is
impressive. Imagine the time it took for those embroiderers to sew all those words and images to tell the story of the Norman
forces sailing from France to England. So, yeah, it's an amazing artifact, but what's problematic is that the tapestry is a very
controversial source. Were you aware of this?
Student: Well, I know some pieces of it were probably lost.
Professor: It is incomplete, but...
Student: But I also read that historians have relied on it to help interpret the events leading up to the invasion and the battle
itself.
Professor: Well, it has great historical value, no doubt, but in my opinion, there's a problem because...well...do you know who
commissioned the tapestry?
Student: It was a church official...um...the bishop of Bayeux, a city in France?
Professor: Yes. And the bishop was also William the Conqueror's half-brother.
Student: Oh! That I didn't know. But regardless of who commissioned it, isn't the fact that it was based on eye witness accounts
the most important thing? I mean, it was made only 17 years after the battle. So plenty of eye witnesses were still alive.
Professor: Yes, that's true. But the real point of the controversy isn't the battle itself. It has to do with the reason for the battle:
who was the rightful heir to the throne? Who would be the next king? And if William the Conqueror's brother is the one who's
commissioned this tapestry...
Student: Then he would be the one to decide which words and images would go on the tapestry and what would be left out.
Professor:Exactly. So of course the tapestry shows why William should be the new king.
Student:I guess I see your point. Embroiderers are just gonna do what they are told to do.
Professor:You have to understand that the tapestry depicted an entire series of events as they were interpreted by the Normans,
the victors of the battle. And that's a problem if you are trying to write objectively about the invasion, especially if you use it as
your only source of information. After all, it's important for historians to examine an event from all sides.
)
TPO 35-Lecture 3 (Frescos)
Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an art history class. The professor has been discussing the Italian Renaissance.
Professor: In our discussion of Italian Renaissance paintings from the 1400s and early 1500s, we've looked at some
masterpieces on canvas and on wood, but our discussion will be grossly incomplete without talking about frescos.
Frescos are basically paintings done on the interiors of buildings, on walls and ceilings. They weren't invented
during the Renaissance. If you remember we looked briefly at frescos paintings way back in our discussion of
ancient Romans and ancient Roman art a few weeks ago. But, it was much later during the Renaissance that the term
fresco was commonly used. It's an Italian word that means literally fresh. And, well, to explain that, we have to get
specific about technique.
Back then, most buildings had stone and brick walls with highly irregular surfaces. They weren't smooth. Also, the
walls weren't completely waterproof. Moisture could seep in. Buildings were often damp. There was no way to
really control humidity inside buildings in those days. So, because frescos are done inside buildings on walls, well,
the walls needed to be prepared before work could begin.
So for example, sometimes, thin reed mats were stuck onto the walls, so these thin reed mats would be like an
additional layer between the original part of the wall and the frescos, the painted part of the walls that were done
over them. The reed mats could smooth out the surface of a rough wall or could also provide that all- important
protection from moisture or do both. So it was the wall, then the mats, then plaster on top of the mats, then the fresco
painted onto the plaster.
Other times though, plaster was applied directly to the walls, a thick layer of plaster, to fill in spaces between the
bricks, to smooth out the wall surface for painting the fresco. You see.
Plaster is a whitish kind of paste, a mixture of lime, water and sand. After you spread plaster on a surface, it'll
harden, like cement does. But as I said, fresco means fresh. And that's because to create a fresco, the painting has to
be applied very soon after the plaster has been spread over a surface, right on to the wet fresh plaster. By doing this,
the painting actually becomes part of the plaster. Finishing a painting before the plaster dry was a real challenge for
fresco painters.
The technique of creating frescos was developed overtime and eventually perfected during the Renaissance, a time
when immense buildings were being erected as symbols of wealth and power, very large buildings, which people
wanted decorated on the inside as well as the outside. The owners of these grand buildings wanted to decorate the
walls to reflect their own affluence and prestige.
Now, few people would argue with the greatness of artists from that period, Michelangelo, Raphael. But there is this
popular mental image people have of an artistic genius producing a masterpiece in total solitude. Well, that idea is
fine for canvas painting or other small works, but a practical reality of fresco painting in the Renaissance was
collaboration. The sheer dimensions of the surfaces involved, plus the physical properties of the plaster, meant it was
inevitable that Renaissance artists would rely on assistants, apprentices they were called, to help create their
masterpieces. Artists had to plan the work carefully, divide it into several days. Each day was a repetition of the
same technical process. Apprentices mix paints, prepare the plaster, spread it on one section of the wall or ceiling,
then finally paint on the wet plaster. This had to be done within a few hours before the plaster dried. So they go
through that whole process in one day on one section. The next day they'd move on and do it again on an adjacent
part. So any fresco commissioned to an artist was, for practical reasons, commissioned to a whole team.
Now, I am not saying a genius like Michelangelo lacked the skill to paint the enormous ceiling of The Sistine Chapel
by himself, but he probably would have had to live until he was 200 years old to finish the ceiling's frescos like that
without anyone's help. So although we aren't sure exactly how many people took an active role in actually painting
the ceiling, we can see areas which are really inferior to Michelangelo's work that must have been painted by his
apprentices.

TPO 35-Lecture 4 (Permian Extinction)
Narrator:Listen to part of a lecture in an Earth science class.
Professor:Let's review something from last week. We talked about an event that happened 65 million years ago. Anyone?
Student:An asteroid hit Earth. Um...well, we think an asteroid hit Earth, near the Yucatan Peninsula, in Mexico, and that wiped out all
the dinosaurs.
Professor:Right. I wouldn't say that we've got 100% proof, but there's very strong evidence that this is why that mass extincti on
occurred.
Okay. But did you know there was an earlier extinction far greater than the one that killed off the dinosaurs? It was what we call the
Permian Extinction.
Now, way back about 290 million years ago, at the beginning of the Permian Period, there was just one big continent, a super
continent. And as the climate warmed up, plant and animal species began to diversify profusely. So life during the Permian Period was
abundant and diverse. But about 250 million years ago, the Permian Period ended with a rapid mass extinction, something happened
that wiped out 75% of the land animals and over 95% of ocean life.
So what was it? What could have caused this?
Well, with the all the evidence that it was an asteroid that led to the dinosaur extinction, we began asking ourselves: is it possible that
another asteroid much earlier caused the Permian Extinction? And so researchers have been looking for an impact crater.
Student:I thought the Permian Extinction was caused by a decline in sea water oxygen levels. Isn't that what's in the textbook?
Professor:But don't forget the textbook makes it very clear that's only a theory.
Student:And it mentions something about volcanic eruptions too.
Professor:It does, but now this new theory has led to a search for evidence of an asteroid impact. And one place of interest is a region
called Wilkes Land in eastern Antarctica.
A few years ago, a researcher reported a strange anomaly beneath the ice in Wilkes Land. Evidence of what may be a mascon. That's
just short for mass concentration.
When an asteroid hits Earth, when it slams into Earth's crust, we think that causes molten rock from deep below the surfa ce to rise up
into the impact area. Sort of like if you bump your head, you get a big lump under the skin. Fluid makes the area swell. Anyway, the
material flowing up from below the crust is more dense than the crust itself. So that's how we get a mascon, a spot in the crust with
newer crust material that's more dense than the material all around it.
There're lots of mascons on the moon too, where a mascon's density causes a small increase in the local gravity that can be measured
and mapped by orbiting spacecraft. And where do these mascons tend to be found? In the centers of impact craters on the moon's
surface.
But back to Wilkes Land. We're not certain that the mascon there...what might be a mascon ...was actually caused by the impact of an
asteroid, but there does seem to be evidence. Researchers notice a gravity anomaly similar to those on the moon. And the spot where
the gravity readings are especially high...this is right in the middle of a 500-kilometer wide, circular ridge, what could be part of an
old impact crater.
And if there was an asteroid impact there in Wilkes Land, the next question is: did it happen 250 million years ago? Because that
would put it when in geologic history?
Student: At the end of the Permian Period? Right when those animals went extinct.
Professor:Exactly.
Student: But can't researchers figure that out by studying the rocks there in Wilkes Land...where this impact supposedly took place?
Professor: Well, to get to anything from that long ago, we would have to drill down to abo ut a mile, about 1.6 kilometers of solid ice
that covers the area today. And that's not likely to happen.
But speaking of rocks, I should mention that Wilkes Land is not the only place of interest here. There's another called the Bedout High
off the coast of Australia. And we have rock samples from the Bedout High. Some apparently have extraterrestrial origin. I mean, they
show the effects of extreme temperatures and pressures, the level of extremes produced only by an impact. And as for their age, well,
they do in fact, date back to about 250 million years ago.

TPO 36-Conversion 1 (Change Of Academic Plan)
Narrator: Listen to a conversation between a student and her academic advisor.
Student: Hi. Professor Jones. Thanks for seeing me.
Professor: No problem, Laura. How was your summer break?
Student: It was great! But the fact is it's made me reconsider my academic plans.
Professor: Oh, really? Nothing too dramatic, I hope.
Student: No, no. At least I hope not.
Professor: What do you mean exactly?
Student: Well, I just spent the summer working on a Native American reservation, a Navajo reservation in
Arizona. And I was fascinated, so now I want to study the Navajo language, uh, their history, religion. I want to go
back next summer too. And maybe even spend a semester there, some kind of internship or independent study?
Professor: Wow! Sounds like you are really enthusiastic, but you were majoring in sociology, and I seem to recall
that for your senior project, you were doing something with education?
Student: Right. I have done some research on the public schools in the northeastern states, how they've been affected
by changes in population, uh, immigration trends, during the past fifty years. But now I really want to study the
culture of the Navajo people.
Professor: Well, there are a couple of options depending on your priorities. Say, how did you end up on a reservation
in Arizona anyway?
Student: Well, a friend of mine took a job there, in a summer school program. And they had another
opening. Someone cancelled at the last minute. I thought it would be just a big adventure, but it turned out to be
much more than that.
Professor: I see. Well, anyway...as I am saying, your options depend on what your priorities are and on exactly what
you want to study.
Student: Uh, like I said...Navajo culture?
Professor: Well, let's see if we can be more specific. If you want to study the Navajo language, learn about their
religion, their history, that's part of cultural anthropology.
Student: No. I really don't want to change majors at this point. I love sociology and I really want to graduate in four
years.
Professor: Okay. Now I see what your priorities are. So from a sociological perspective, since you are interested in
education, you can stay with that, change your research topic to the Native American experience with public
education, the effect it had. And you could take sociology courses on religion or the role of minorities in society,
again, focusing your research on the Navajo.
Student: Um...l hadn't thought about that angle. Sounds intriguing. And all the courses I have already taken would
still count toward my degree?
Professor: I have to check. And remind me to plan carefully to make sure all your degree requirements are met, but I
don't see any problems.
Student: Great! And then I can pick up the language and culture courses as electives.

TPO 36-Lecture 1 (Potential Energy Source - Helium-3)
Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an environmental science class.
Professor: Now last week when we discussed the serious energy challenges we are going to face as the world's
population continues to grow and we place more stress on our finite supply of fossil fuels, especially natural gas and
oil, well, maybe it's not all doom and gloom. In a number of areas, scientists are thinking outside the box and trying
to come up with unusual, novel solutions to the energy question. Not that a positive outcome is inevitable by any
means, but well, let's take a look at one of these creative ideas involving a gas - helium-3.
Helium-3 is an isotope of helium that has tremendous potential for use in practical energy applications. Remember,
an isotope is a form of a chemical element that has the same number of protons in its atomic nucleus but a different
number of neutrons. The most common isotope of helium on Earth is helium-4, which does not have any known or
potential uses as an energy source. Helium-3, in comparison, is extremely rare. There isn't very much of it on
Earth. Plus, the, um, the main source of helium-3 in our solar system is solar wind, a stream of lethal radiation and
particles pouring off of sun. And Earth's magnetic field fortunately prevents that wind from reaching us.
So why is helium-3 so exciting?
Well, it seems a sure bet that helium-3 is available in abundant quantities on the moon. Since the moon doesn't have
a magnetic field, the solar wind must have been depositing helium-3 there for billions of years. In fact, Apollo
astronauts have already discovered it in the moon's dust. Some estimates hold that there may be a million tons of
helium-3 buried on the lunar surface. And one ton is more than enough energy for a city of ten million people for a
whole year. So you can see this would certainly solve most of our energy problems. But how could this be possible?
Well, we think helium-3 would have to be used in nuclear fusion reactors. Keep in mind that a nuclear fusion reactor
is completely different from our existing nuclear fission reactors. Basically a nuclear plant powered by nuclear
fission derives its energy from the splitting of atoms. While a plant based on nuclear fusion utilizes the energy
produced when atoms are fused together. Fusion is the same nuclear reaction that fuels stars, which as you know,
produces unfathomable amounts of energy.
Researchers have identified two isotopes of hydrogen as the most promising fuel sources for fusion power
plants. However, there is a real drawback. They both produce large amounts of radioactive material in the fusion
reaction. But helium-3 fusion produces no radioactive material. In fact, one proponent stated you could safely build
a helium-3 power plant in the middle of a city.
A clean, safe source of power almost sounds too good to be true, doesn't it? Well, of course, this is all very
theoretical. And there are issues that have to be addressed.
For one thing, we still haven't created a single nuclear fusion plant despite decades of research and development. An
often heard joke about fusion is that a nuclear fusion plant has been just decades away from being created for several
decades now. Nuclear fusion research is still ongoing, as strong as ever, in fact, but we still don't have a full- scale
fusion plant to point to.
And there's a rather big logistical problem as well. How to get the helium 3 off the moon? Digging the stuff up is
challenging because the distribution of helium-3 is so diffused across the lunar surface. One estimate is you'd need
to heat a million tons of lunar soil to about 800 degree Celsius to yield about 70 tons of helium-3 gas. It's kind of
liking digging out a crater with a spoon to find the single nugget of gold. Kind of ridiculous, right? There's a camp
that believes it'll take more energy to extract helium-3 gas than the gas itself would provide.
So there are concerns, but given the lure of the possibilities and the pressing nature of our energy difficulties, it‟s
possible that helium-3 could be a significant driver of future exploration of the moon. And it certainly could ease the
pressure on the demand for fossil fuels if and when the numerous challenges, and not just the ones we've talked
about, are solved.

TPO 36-Lecture 2 (Vegetation Discoloration And Mayan Ruins)
Listen to part of a lecture in an archaeology class.
Professor: Sure. Sometimes we do just stumble onto an important find when doing field research, but usually we've got at least
a vague idea of where to look. And with new technology...uh...Okay.
Here's a story that illustrates what I mean.
It's about the Mayans, who, as you remember, flourished in Central America and had a culture that was quite advanced in art,
architecture, astronomy...We know that despite regular droughts and poor soil, their numbers grew into the millions over the
centuries until about 1,200 years ago when their entire civilization just seemed to disappe ar, and we are not sure why.
Okay
So an archaeologist named William Saturno1 goes looking for ancient Mayan ruins in Guatemala near a town called San
Bartolo. And after several days of extremely difficult hiking through the thick rainforest, Saturno stops to rest in the shade and
finds himself sitting in what turns out to be an ancient Mayan temple, a pyramid 25 meters high. And inside, on the walls of this
temple, Saturno finds some ancient writing and also this enormous mural with elegant figures d epicting a Mayan myth of the
creation of the world. And it's all painted on plaster that's over 2,000 years old, which makes it the oldest Mayan artwork ever
found, at least in good condition, and in fact, one of the most perfectly preserved and extremely important find.
Student: Wow! Do you have a picture of it?
Professor: Now...hang on. I don't...there's a point I want to make here.
It happens that someone at NASA, the United States Space Agency, reads about Saturno's discovery and gets very excited
'cause the space agency has just produced some images of this area using a technique called remote sensing. That's when
instruments on planes and satellites survey areas on the ground. And the newest twist on remote sensing, quite new, is infrared
imaging. Instead of taking regular photographs, the satellite cameras take pictures using infrared light, which is invisible to the
human eye, but computers can then process these images so our eyes can see them.
Using infrared imaging, the satellite-based remote sensing instruments revealed what turned out to be traces of water storage
systems and canals, canals that the Mayans built to irrigate their parched soil, which helps explain how the Mayans could fee d
such a large population. The infrared images also revealed ancient roadways that had tied Mayan cities together. So people at
the space agency figured Saturno would be interested and they sent him this infrared image of the area near San Bartolo where
the pyramid temple was found.
Now, this is a false color image based on an infrared photo. So the greens of the jungle are shown mostly as blue and red, but
notice also the spots of greenish yellow scattered here and there. These indicate significant discoloration in the vegetation, at
least as it appears to infrared cameras. And Saturno notices that some of that discolorations located in exactly the spot where he
found the pyramid temple. So he figures, hey, maybe some of those other yellow spots are worth investigating. Well, long story
short, he checks out three different spots where the photo shows discoloration and finds an ancient Mayan site overgrown with
vegetation at every single one. Further exploration shows a perfect correlation between yellow spots on the infrared image and
Mayan ruins hidden in the jungle.
Student: So what caused those spots to look different?
Professor: Well, Saturno believes the limestone and lime plasters that the Mayans used to build their structures...Over time, uh,
this limestone decayed and seeped into the soil and changed the soil's chemistry. Then calcium carbonate from the decaying
lime plaster might have been taken out by the roots of the trees growing there, uh, up into their leaves, and made them give off
infrared light much more brightly than the surrounding vegetation. And infrared sensing technology can detect this.
Student: So...like...is Guatemala the only place where archaeologists have used remote sensing?
Professor: No. This technique has been used in other parts of Central America too, and also in Brazil, Bolivia, Cambod ia. It can
be used anywhere the rainforest has obscured ancient ruins.
And the results can be amazing! Like another Mayan temple that Saturno found, thanks to remote sensing, he had walked right
by it every day for five years and had no idea it was there, until he saw an infrared image of the area!

TPO 36-Conversion 2 (Talk Show Application)
Narrator: Listen to a conversation between a student and the program manager of the university radio station.
Student: Hi I'm Jim, the guy who's trying to get a new show.
Manager: Right. Jim.
Student: My application got turned down and...um...l am not sure why. So I wonder if you could explain...
Manager: I'm glad you came in, Jim. I was actually quite impressed with your application.
Student: Okay.
Manager: But the thing is, we run a music station here, not a talk station. We've been a music station since the
beginning, since the station's inception.
Student: This is where I get confused because of the article in last month's campus newspaper about the poll...
Manager: Yes. The survey...
Student: I mean, a majority of students said they felt the station was stale, that it needed a breath of fresh air. Well,
um, how are we supposed to get fresh air if you keep all the windows closed? I was just trying to open some
windows for people.
Manager: I can tell you have a lot of passion for this, but I'm really not convinced it's a good idea. Okay.
The first thing is, again, this is a music station. If we just have that one calling show, it just doesn't fit in with what
we are doing. And studies have showed that mixed format stations just aren't as successful as...Look. We do want to
innovate, but within the format. And with a live calling show, for one thing, you have no idea what the caller is
going to say, no idea what you could end up broadcasting.
Student: I understand, but that seems like a small risk to take in exchange for giving students a chance to talk
publicly, interactively about issues they care about. I really think they'd like to have a place where they can air their
views about current events, about the university.
Manager: But the university already has that. There's a monthly meeting open to all students to discuss issues like
the ones you mentioned in your application. And there are several student clubs on campus that discuss current
events. But either way we have no plans to change the format.
Now, if you had an innovative idea for a new music program...
Student: Well...how about a music program that includes taking calls from listeners?
Manager: You really are determined to have a calling show, huh?
Student: Well, I'm a communications major, and I'm hoping to get an internship at a professional talk radio show in
the city next year. I thought a little experience with the college station might help.
Manager: Tell you what, there's still some time before the application deadline. Why don't you submit a new
application with the music show idea that you just proposed? Then we will see if we can work something out.
Student: Okay. Thanks!

TPO 36-Lecture 3 (Suburb Housing Design)
Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an architecture class. The professor has been discussing housing designs.
Professor: Alright, in our last class we began our discussion of housing designs in the United States from the
1940's. You'll remember, for example, that we looked at some photos and discussed apartment complex in Chicago
from that decade.
Now, today, let's talk about housing design in the suburbs. The demand for low-cost housing outside the cities
increased in the late 1940's after World War II as a whole generation of young families needed affordable housing,
and a firm called Levitt & Sons strove to meet this demand in some pretty innovative ways.
They designed buildings based on the demands of the public, not so much their own artistic vision, and created a
residential community in the state of New York that became known as Levittown.
Levittown was the first suburb of its kind and it started out with 2,000 homes. They were called 'Cape Cod houses',
the 'Cape Cod model', and they were designed to look like the historical cottages in the New England states in the
northeastern United States.
The original floor plan was very simple. The living room was in the front of the house with windows looking out
towards the street. You also had two bedrooms, um, a bathroom and a kitchen. Everything was on one floor. The
bathroom was right next to the kitchen, which was a way of keeping building costs down since the two rooms could
rely on just one plumbing system.
Another feature of this Cape Cod house is that it could be expanded as families grew and needed more space. You
had the downstairs but up the stairs the house actually had unfinished attic space as well. Levitt & Sons promoted
their houses saying this attic space could easily be converted into another bedroom or even two, and then there was
always the possibility of building additional rooms onto the house later.
Each house was built the same way and with the same materials. All parts were standardized so houses could be
built economically. This was important because it meant that they were affordable for young families who wanted to
live outside of the city. As a result, what you had was a whole community of houses that, except for the color of
their roof and walls, were identical. So eventually there's going to be a demand for some variety, right?
After a couple of years, Levitt & Sons came up with a second design. Well, they called it a second design because it
had a slightly different roof. Plus, the exterior had a more modern look.
This model was called a ranch house.
Now, I'm guessing it wasn't too expensive or time-consuming for Levitt to come up with this idea, but it was
certainly efficient and hugely popular with families. The Ranch is like the Cape Cod except that the living room is in
the back of the house instead of the front, and on this Ranch model there is one more important feature that is not
present in the Cape Cod. It has a large window in the living room called a 'picture window', which gives you a kind
of 'framed view' of the outside. The way the Ranch is set up when you look out this picture window from the living
room you're looking out from the back of the house instead of from the front. Parents could watch the children
playing in the backyard, the grassy area behind the house rather than a view of the street. So here was a way for
families to disconnect their home, their house, their private lives from the outside world, which was represented by
the street that led to work and school, which really seems like the thing they had been looking for all along, but the
floor plan was just like the Cape Cod only, you know, turned 90 degrees.
Levitt & Sons offered their ranch houses for sales at a low price. They could do that because they were using the
simple and therefore cost-saving building methods. Another way they kept construction prices down was to train
workers who went from house to house doing a specific task, sort of like an assembly line. For example, you might
have a painter whose job was to paint the doors of each house and then it would be someone else's job to install the
doors. This way houses went up quickly, saving time and money. And the Levitt's ideas caught on. In the early
1950's, their designs became a model for suburb construction throughout the country.

TPO 36-Lecture 4 (Gause's Hypothesis)
Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a biology class.
Professor: OK. Back in the 1930's, a biologist named G.F. Gause first proposed what's known as 'Gause's
hypothesis'.
Gause said that whenever you've got two similar species competing for the exact same limited resources, one of
them will have some sort of advantage, however slight that'll eventually enable this species to dominate and
ultimately exclude the other one, even cause it to become extinct. That's why Gause's hypothesis came to be called
'The competitive exclusion principle'.
Gause did some lab experiments like placing two Paramecium species in the same environment where they would
have to compete for the same food. He found that, over time, one species was consistently able to drive out the
other, to eliminate it from the habitat, just as his hypothesis predicted.
Now, one of the early criticisms of Gause's hypothesis was that: 'sure, it works in simple lab experiments where you
have just two competing species in a controlled environment, but the hypothesis falls apart when applied to natural
ecosystems where things are more complex'.
Now, it's true that in the real world there are lots of examples that seem to contradict the hypothesis. For example, in
the forest of New England, in the northeastern United States, there are some small songbirds called wobblers and
right in the same area you've got five species of wobbler, all about the same size and all having similar diets of
insects, uh, insects that are found on and around trees. Yet, these five wobbler species all managed to coexist. There
is no dominance, no exclusion of one species by another.
How is this possible?
Well, turns out that one wobbler species feeds in the uppermost branches, while others favor the middle branches
and others feed toward the bottom of the tree. Also, each wobbler species breeds at a different time of year. This
way the period of peak food requirement, um, when the birds are feeding their chicks, varies from one species to the
next.
Yes, Mark?
Student: But does that really contradict Gause's hypothesis? Because, I mean, are those different wobbler species
really competing for the same food? I don't think so. I think they're more like, you know, almost cooperating so that
they don't have to compete.
Professor: Excellent! To the casual observer, the wobblers do seem to contradict Gause's hypothesis since they all
live in the same place and eat the same types of insects.
But if you observe these birds more closely, the wobbler species are not really competing with one another for the
exact same food at the exact same time, which brings us to a really important concept in ecology: the niche.
Mark, can you tell us what an ecological niche is?
Student: The place where the plant or animal lives, you know, its habitat.
Professor: For example?
Student: Like the polar bear living in the Arctic on the ice sheet. The Artie is its niche, the habitat it's adapted to
survive in.
Professor: Okay. That's what most people think of.
But for biologists, the concept of a niche also includes the way an organism functions in its habitat, how it interacts
with other plant and animal species, with the soil, the air, the water and so on.
Okay. Now let's put it all together.
)
If you have two similar species competing in the same niche, what's going to happen? Susan?
Student: One will dominate the other and eventually eliminate it.
Professor: Okay.
So what could the weaker species do to improve its chances of survival?
Student: Maybe just move to some other area, you know, away from the competitor.
Professor: That's one possibility. But think of the scientific definition of a niche. Think about the wobblers.
Mark?
Student: Maybe it could find some new way of functioning in its habitat so that it wouldn't have to compete with the
dominant species. Keep the same habitat but not the exact same niche.
Professor: Yes, and there are many ways to do that. The dominant species feeds in one part of the tree and you feed
in another.
Student: If the dominant species needs a lot of water you develop the ability to survive on very little water.
Professor: You survive on what's left over: water, food, nesting or breeding sites, whatever.

TPO 37-Conversion 1 (Ancient Peru Featherwork)
Narrator: Listen to a conversation between a student and his anthropology professor.
Professor: Well, Mathew. Good to see you. How can I help you?
Student: Did you happen to read last weekend's art section of the newspaper?
Professor: Yes, I did. Why?
Student: Well, you remember the article about an exhibition of ancient featherwork pieces from Peru? I'm thinking
of doing my research paper on this topic, if it's okay with you, of course. I've done some additional reading about
ancient Peruvian cultures, how they used brightly colored feathers to decorate clothes and ceremonial objects. From
the pictures I'm seen, they are beautiful works of art.
Professor: They sure are. I saw the exhibition a few days ago. But is that how you'd approach Peruvian featherwork
in your paper? As an art form?Remember you need to take an anthropological angle. Uh, look at this in a way that
tells us something about the people who made this featherwork and the societies they lived in.
Student: Well, absolutely. I read that most of the really colorful feathers came from the rain forest and the societies
who used them lived on the coast on the other side of the Andes Mountains, so the feathers had to be carried over the
Andes. No wonder featherwork was symbol of high status in ancient Peruvian societies.
Professor: That's definitely a long, dangerous trip to make on foot. I do research down in Peru and I have made that
trip, but the easy way. I've flown and driven.
Student: I didn't know you did research in Peru. Maybe...do you think you would be able to help me with this paper?
Professor: I'll be happy to help if I can, but Peruvian featherwork isn't my area of expertise. You know, every few
pieces of featherwork survive because feathers decay so quickly. Not many people have had the chance to study
them up close. There is a handful of experts out there who have, and I could try to contact some of them. But I think
your best bet is to keep reading and finding more books and articles. And of course you can use the information you
got at the exhibition as source material too. You've been to the exhibition, haven't you?
Student: Uh, actually...not yet.
Professor: Um...well, it would be a good idea if you went, don't you think?
It's good that you've done some background reading, but it will make more sense when you actually see the
featherwork. There's a lot of information available there from book lists, tour guides. And you could even ask to
meet with the curator and ask for her insights.

TPO 37-Lecture 1 (Soil Formation)
Narrator:Listen to part of a lecture in the geology class.
Professor:So, we all know soil. It's important to plant growth, right? And we know that there're different types of soil in
different places and that some soils are more fertile than others. But what is soil? And how's it formed? Well, we're going
to go into this in some depth, but for now let's just lay down the basics.
Soil is composed of two kinds of material: inorganic material, basically small pieces of rock, and organic material, which
is animal and plant matter.
OK. So, what do you think? If I mix bits of rock with composted vegetables, will I get soil? The answer is no, because the
formation of soil is a dynamic process. It involves not only the initial inputs, the raw materials, but also the
transformation of those materials, and the movement of some of the materials and the loss of others. So, the inputs are bits
of rock and organic matter.
Now, the bits of rock, the inorganic input to soil, uh...they come from the breakdown of rocks on Earth's surface through a
process called weathering.
Weathering can be either physical or chemical. Physical weathering, uh...that's when exposure to the elements over time
causes a rock to break up and eventually disintegrate. Uh... of course, some rocks are more resistant to physical
weathering than others. If you think of the sand particles in soil, those are the result of physical weathering, and they have
the same chemical composition as the original rock.
Now, chemical weathering, uh... that's the chemical breakup of rocks. It differs from physical weathering in that the
chemical properties of the minerals are actually changed. The clay minerals you find in soil are the result of chemical
weathering. Clay minerals are called secondary minerals, because their composition has been altered.
Okay. So we have weathered rock, which needs to be combined with organic matter.
So what does the organic input consist of?
It's the remains of plants and animals, but mostly plants. Now, just as rocks are broken down by weathering, the animal
and plant residues are broken down, too. They're reduced to simple chemicals by microorganisms in a process called
mineralization. And just as some rocks are more resistant than others to weathering, the compounds found in the soil's
organic input resist mineralization at different rates. The compound cellulose is the major constituent of most plant
tissue. It mineralizes relatively quickly. But there are woody substances in certain plants that strengthen the cell
walls. They are found in smaller concentrations and their mineralization can take several years.
Weathering and mineralization transform the inorganic and organic inputs in a number of ways. And it's partly from these
transformations that soil gets its unique properties.
How does it work?
Uh... take the dark brown color of soil. After microorganisms have broken down the cellulose, we're left with two things:
the microbe's waste and the more resistant plant material that microorganisms can't break down easily. These materials
ultimately get transformed into a new material called humus. And when humus is combined with the clay minerals in soil,
that's what gives soil its dark brown color. So now, if we've got clay and humus, these transformed materials, and we mix
them together, we've got something very close to soil.
But soil isn't static, and there're still other processes that go into the formation of soil: the movement and loss of
materials. The soil in any location isn't a uniform mixture.Its composition varies with depth. You see, mineral and organic
materials move through soil vertically.Some materials move more easily than others. Water carries the more mobile
materials from the upper level of soil to the lower levels.So the upper levels of the soil eventually get depleted of these
materials, while the lower levels get enriched with them. And that creates distinct layers of soil as far down as the rock
underlying the soil. And the materials that dissolve easily in water can get lost completely if the water carries them
horizontally out of the soil and into rivers.
Now, of course, new mineral and organic material will be deposited at the surface and become incorporated into the soil,
but you see how the processes of movement and loss contribute to the formation of soil.

TPO 37-Lecture 2 (Cats' Domestication)
Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an archaeology class.
Professor: In our last class we began talking about animal domestication. And we said it's the process whereby a
population of animals is bred in captivity and becomes accustomed to being provided for and controlled by
humans. Question, Jim?
Student: Yeah. I was thinking...you said domesticated animals usually served some kind of purpose for humans, like
horses could...uh...pull heavy loads, and dogs could hunt or herd sheep, but cats, why were they ever domesticated? I
mean, mine can't do much of anything.
Professor: Interesting question. Cats don't seem likely candidates for domestication, do they? They actually lack an
important characteristic that most animals that can be domesticated have. Domesticable animals tend to live in herds or
packs, with clear dominance hierarchies. Humans could easily take advantage of this hierarchical structure. By
supplanting the alpha individual, they could gain control of the whole group or of individuals as in the case of dogs. Cats
in the wild, though, rarely have this structure. For the most part, they are solitary hunters. But as for their utility to
humans, well, it's helpful to think about when and where cat domestication might have begun.Any ideas, Jim?
Student: Well, I guess ancient Egypt. I'm thinking of all those ancient Egyptian paintings of cats.
Professor: Good guess. Those paintings you mentioned do provide the oldest known depictions of full cat domestication,
where cats are, without question, household companions. The paintings from about 3,600 years ago typically show cats in
Egyptian homes poised under chairs, sometimes wearing collars, eating scraps of food out of bowls. But the Egyptians
don't get credited for the early stages of cat domestication where cats are just beginning to interact with humans. There are
signs of early domestication as far back as 9,500 years ago! Recently, two graves were discovered on the Island of
Cyprus.
One was the grave of a human, buried with some tools, sea shells and other items, and nearby, a cat was buried in its own
grave. Interestingly, the cat's body was oriented in the same westward direction as the human's body.
Another notable thing about the two bodies was that they were in an identical state of preservation, suggesting they had
been buried at the same time. So we can assume that humans had at least some kind of relationship with cats as early as
9,500 years ago!
Student: So cat domestication began in Cyprus?
Professor: Well, except cats weren't native to Cyprus. They were undoubtedly brought over to the island by boat probably
from the nearby coast of the Fertile Crescent in the Middle East. In fact, extensive DNA analysis has now confirmed what
archaeologists have believed for quite some time.All modern domesticate cats arose from just one subspecies of wild cat
from that single location: the Fertile Crescent, and not from any of the other four subspecies of wild cats located in other
areas throughout the world. Pretty amazing, isn't it?
Which brings us back to Jim's question: Why did it happen and how? Well, for years, researchers have pondered this
question of cat domestication, and the best I can do here is just a theory, but tell me it doesn't make sense.
In evolutionary terms, early settlements and agriculture in the Fertile Crescent around 10,000 years ago created a
completely new environment for any wild animals that were flexible and curious enough to exploit it. Mice were attracted
to these settlements, and cats, being obligate carnivores they must eat meat to thrive，They were almost certainly drawn
to the settlements by the mice. Over time, only the cats that could adapt to living in human-dominated environments
would have stayed and thrived. People probably encouraged them to stick around and controlled the mice in the field and
the granaries, and eventually, their homes, and perhaps simply grew to like their company too.
Student: Hmm...so in a way, the difference with cats was that domestication was their idea instead of ours.
But why do you suppose only one of the five subspecies was domesticated? Were the others just not friendly enough
towards humans?
Professor: Well, no. In fact, at least two of the other subspecies are known to be relatively friendly, but the Fertile
Crescent subspecies had, well, a head start because of its proximity to the first human settlements. And as agriculture
spread, the tamed ancestors of this subspecies spread with it.So they fill the niche of home companion in each region they
entered and effectively shut out the local subspecies that were already there.

TPO 37-Conversion 2 (Preparation Of A Shakespeare Play)
Narrator: Listen to a conversation between a student and a university theater manager.
Student: I'm sorry if my email wasn't clear. It's probably best that we are meeting now. I have a lot of questions.
Manager: So do I. But first let me say that I'm so glad that this tradition is continuing. I guess for the last twenty
years now, every senior classes put on a Shakespeare Play.
Student: It won't be anything like the drama department's productions in the main theater, but we are really
excited. We are doing 'As You Like It' this year.
Manager: Great! Let's start with the timing. You want the production to run on two consecutive nights, Thursday and
Friday?
Student: Right. The end of April will be best. Maybe the last Thursday and Friday? We are flexible with the dates.
Manager: The only bookings at the small theater are some recitals in the beginning of the month, so I'll make sure to
get it on the calendar. But you other questions...let's see. You want to use fire on stage?
Student: Well, our idea is to reproduce the conditions of an Elizabethan playhouse, make it as authentic as
possible. And of course, they didn't have electric lights 500 years ago. So we thought if we had candles, a lot of
candles actually...
Manager: To light the stage?
Student: Yeah.
Manager: Okay. Um...you'd need a special permit. You could get one from the city council. But for one thing, it's
difficult and time-consuming to get permission and expensive. And it's not just a permit, you'll have to pay for an
inspection and to have a fire marshal present at the shows.
Student: That does sound expensive. If we had a budget like the drama department...but it looks like we'll have to
scale back a bit.
Manager: Are you charging admission?
Student: There will be a small admission fee. In Shakespeare's time, if you paid a little more, you got a more
comfortable seat. I don't see how we could do that though. I mean, all the seats are the same, right?
Manager: Right. I guess you could charge more for the seats upfront, but it's a small theater.
Student: And there isn't much difference between the front and the back.
Manager: Anyway, for lighting, you could buy those electric lanterns that are made to look as if they had a natural
flame.
Student: If that's the best we can do, not exactly authentic, though.
Manager: But safer and less expensive. And about the food...
Student: Selling food was also done in Shakespeare's time. It's related to the candles actually. When the candles burn
down, they stops the play so they can bring out new ones, and that's when they sold snacks. That's how the custom
of having an intermission started.
Manager: I always thought intermissions began as a way to change the scenery.
Student: Oh, speaking of scenery...do you have the exact dimensions of the stage?
Manager: Sure.

Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an art history class.
Professor: I'm sure you've all heard of the Mona Lisa, the famous painting by Leonardo Da Vinci. The Mona Lisa is
a portrait of a woman and it's thought to be the portrait of Lisa Gherardini but that's not certain. In fact, many things
about the Mona Lisa remain a mystery. For example, we don't know exactly who commissioned the painting or how
long Da Vinci worked on it and there are actually many scholars who think the mystery makes the painting more
interesting. I think it places unfortunate limits on our analyses, makes it hard to make strong arguments about the
painting.
Anyway, getting to the point: most people today might have never heard of the Mona Lisa, or of many other now
famous works of art for that matter, if it hadn't been for Giorgio Vasari.
Giorgio Vasari was an Italian painter, architect and scholar. In the mid fifteen hundreds, he wrote a book called
Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors and Architects in which he describes, among many other things, the
features of the Mona Lisa, including her famous smile. This book drew a lot of attention to Da Vinci and
significantly increased the Mona Lisa's fame.
As the title suggests, Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors and Architects includes biographies not only of
Da Vinci but also of many other now famous Italian renaissance artists. This was the first time that a European
author had made the personal lives of the artists a central component of an art history book and many a later author
followed the example. The more important the artist in Vasari's view, the longer their biography in the book.
And by far, the longest of the biographies, is that of Michelangelo, the painter of the Sistine Chapel ceiling and
sculptor of the famous statue of David, whose work Vasari adopted as his benchmark, his reference point for
evaluating everyone else's artwork.
Many of the biographies are extremely detailed with all the basic facts about where the artists were born, where
they'd worked, who their teachers were and so on.
But I read Vasari's book cover to cover almost every summer. I find it a great way to unwind during the summer
break and what keeps me coming back to it are the anecdotes, fascinating anecdotes, that give you glimpses in the
artist's private lives, their dreams, their fears, their virtues, their vices.
In his book, Vasari also tackled, quite successfully I might add, the enormous task of sorting out which works had
been done by which artists, which works belong in the same stylistic categories, which works belong in similar
categories in terms of quality and so on, stuff you take for granted today. But again, Vasari was the first European
author to do that.
A word of caution though: Vasari was not at all averse to, how should I put it, modifying the facts. For example, in
his book, he has a touching description of Da Vinci's death, in which Da Vinci dies in the arms of his last patron:
The king of France, Francis the First.
Now, Da Vinci did spend the last years of his life working in the court of Francis the First. Vasari seemed to have
overlooked a minor detail, however, the well documented fact that the king was far away when Da Vinci breathed
his last breath. But why let the fact stand in the way of a great story, right? Since Vasari's tales are, as I've said, so
compelling and because they have been repeated by so many subsequent authors, they're still often taken at face
value. Even today. No questions asked.

TPO 37-Lecture 4 (Endotherms And Ectotherms)
Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a biology class.
Professor: So, to review, who remembers how animals are classified in terms of body temperature? Mike?
Student: Um, endotherms and ectotherms?
Professor: Right! All animals are considered either endotherms or ectotherms. Therm-that means heat, and the main thing that distinguishes
endotherms from ectotherms is the source of body heat.
So an endotherm, endo- meaning internal, an endotherm's body heat mainly comes from inside its body. It can generate its own heat
internally with its metabolism. And an ectotherm, ecto- meaning external, an ectotherm gets its body heat mainly from outside its own body,
meaning from its environment, mostly from the sun's radiation. So we've got endotherms. Mammals and birds are the classes that fall under
this category. And ectotherms, that's pretty much everything else, including reptiles, amphibians, insects.
Now, body temperature is important. And if an animal's environment gets very hot or very cold, something needs to happen in order for the
animal to maintain its body temperature within its normal range. In endotherms, this is mostly physiological. The body changes its rate of
heat production.
Okay, well, humans are endotherms. What does your body automatically do when it gets really cold?
Student: Shiver?
Professor: Right, shivering. In fact, any muscle movement increases metabolism, the process that produces heat and keeps your body
temperature up when your surroundings get cold.
And then there's what's known as brown fat, like other kinds of fat, it stores triiodothyronine, but brown fat is unique beca use it chemically
produces lots of heat even without muscle movement. That's especially beneficial for small mammals in colder climates. And when an animal
gets too hot, well, have you ever seen a dog cooling off by taking short, quick breaths? And humans, we sweat, of course, perspire, which
also gets rid of body heat. These are automatic, physiological responses too. Yes, Sally?
Student: So, in endotherms it's really not about behavior, about doing things.
Professor: Well, a human, you know, might put on a winter coat or jump in a swimming pool, or elephants, elephants might spla sh
themselves with cold water when it's warm out, but for the most part, no. It's not what we endotherms do that keeps our temperatures within
range, unlike ectotherms.
Student: Well, what about ectotherms, like frogs? They must have metabolism too.
Professor: Sure they do.
It's just that metabolism in ectotherms is so much lower. I mean, the metabolic rate of an endotherm, say, a mouse, is at least six or seven
times that of an ectotherm of a similar size like a frog or a lizard. An ectotherm doesn't generate nearly as much heat internally. So its body
temperature will tend to equalize with the temperature of its surroundings. And that's where behavior comes in. Imagine a lizard, okay, living
in the desert.
Now, a desert gets very cold at night and very hot during the day. So what does the lizard do to maintain its body temperature? Well, on a
cold morning, it can warm itself by going to a sunny spot and lying in the sun, and later if it gets too hot, it can seek out a cool place in the
shade. It's by means of such behavior that an ectotherm like this lizard regulates its temperature. But you put that same lizard in a temperature
controlled chamber and gradually drop the temperature, say, 20 degrees, and here of course, the lizard can't go off to lie in the sun. So what
happens?
Student: Well, the lizard's body temperature drops too.
Professor: Right, and this really slows down its metabolism, which depends on temperature. Even that 20 degrees drop in body temperature
though, the lizard can survive that no problem, and come out just fine when it warms up again. Ectotherms can do that.
Student: But an ectotherm probably wouldn't survive in a place where the temperatures got too low, right?
Professor: Ever heard a frog being chased by a polar bear?
Student: No.
Professor: Well, there you are. Now a mouse in the same situation, in the same temperature chamber, is just the opposite of the lizard. When
the temperature goes down, the mouse's metabolism goes up. Like any endotherm, it starts producing more heat to keep its body temperature
stable, same as it would do outside in a field.

TPO 38-Conversion 1 (Campus Housing For Summer)
Narrator: Listen to a conversation between a student and an employee in the university housing office.
Employee: Hi. Can I help you?
Student: I hope so. I am taking a class this summer and I need to see about getting campus housing.
Employee: Oh, sorry. I am afraid the deadline to apply for summer housing in the dormitories has already passed. I could
help you look for something off campus.
Student: Well, see, I only found out yesterday I need to take this course. It wasn't really my idea. I mean I was gonna take
it in the fall. It is a course I need for my major in cognitive science, Professor Wilson was supposed to teach it but now...
Employee: Oh, right. I heard he is taking a last-minute leave of absence next year. I hope everything is okay.
Student: Oh yeah. He'll be in Botswana helping develop the new cognitive science program at our sister university
there. Anyway I have to take the course this summer if I want to graduate on time. I've got a note from the dean approving
the whole situation.
Employee: Oh, well, in that case I guess we'd better make an exception for you. Only problem is most of the bedrooms are
gone already. Was there any particular dorm you were interested in?
Student: Well, I'm in Randolph Hall right now, but my roommate's graduating in May so I have signed up for a single in
Murphy for the fall, room 206. I was hoping I might be able to just move in there now.
Employee: Well, let's see what the computer says. Sorry, that room's scheduled for repainting and maintenance over the
summer. So I can't give it to you.
Student: I don't really care if it's repainted. I'll be covering most of the walls with posters anyway. Couldn't I just take it as
is?
Employee: Sorry, no. It is actually a city ordinance. All rental rooms including dorm rooms have to be painted at least
once every five years.
Student: Oh, well, how about if I stay where I'm for the summer? I'm pretty sure they just painted it a couple years ago.
Employee: Hang on, let me check. You said Randolph, right?
Student: Room 122.
Employee: Oops. Afraid not. The entire floor is taken.
Student: Oh, well. Guess I'll just have to move twice.
Employee: One sec. I have got one more idea. Here we go. There is a room open in Murphy just down the hall from your
new one. That way come fall, you'd only have to carry your things a few doors down.
Student: Okay, works for me.
Employee: Now, that room is a double. Right now you have got it to yourself but there's a chance someone else might
sign up at the last minute, not likely. But you could end up with a roommate for the summer. Would that be okay?
Student: Oh, sure. I can get along with anyone for a couple of months.
Employee: Okay, then, I will get the forms printed up. They should be ready for you by tomorrow afternoon. You can
stop by and sign them then.
Student: Excellent, thanks.

TPO 38-Lecture 1 (Tulip-breaking Virus)
Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a botany class.
Professor: Okay. Let's move on, to bacteria and viruses that can infect plants. And let's start out with a virus that's
rather common in various plants but first became known in connection with tulips. This virus can cause a change in
pigmentation that dramatically affects the color of the plant's leaves or flower petals. But since not all cells of the
plant tissue are infected, the result tends to be color variation. With color intensified in one part of the flower petal
and faded in another, this is called color breaking. And the virus that causes this in tulip is called the tulip-breaking
virus.
The tulip-breaking virus is now known to have detrimental effects on plants. They're weaker and sometimes reduced
in size.
But for centuries people didn't have a clue about this virus. Not until the early 1900s was it known what caused the
color breaking in tulips, what made the tulip plant produce flower petals so radically different in color or in pattern
from what you would have expected.
Tulip flowers with stripes or streaks or feather or flame patterns on their petals, there is no doubt in my mind that
these symptoms of this breaking virus affected human behavior too indirectly, that they set off the famous tulip
craze in the Netherlands.Let me explain.
In the 17th century, the Netherlands was among the most important trading centers in all of Europe with lots of rich
merchants who wanted to showcase their wealth, for example, by displaying exotic tulips in their private gardens.
Now, tulips are not native to the Netherlands. They originated in the mountains of Central Asia and spread from
Persia, present-day Iran, to the Turkish Ottoman Empire and from there eventually reached Europe.
There's an explanation for the origin of the name 'tulip' that kind of reflects this. Apparently, it came from a Persian
word for 'turban', you know, a cloth wound round the head. Um, a style of headgear worn by men in that part of the
world.
Well, the Ottomans used a similar name for tulips after they acquired them from Persia. And then, in the late 16th
century, a variation on that name found its way from what is now Turkey to the Netherlands along with the plant
itself.
Okay.
A tulip, of course, is typically grown from an underground bulb. And although as it flowers the old bulb shrivels to
almost nothing, the plant produces another large bulb and maybe two, three, four smaller ones to take its place, and
while tulips take up to seven years to bloom if you start from seeds. A large bulb can produce a flower the very next
year. With the smaller bulbs it takes maybe a couple of years. And since these bulbs remain viable for quite a long
time, even out of the ground, they can be stored or transported long distances without much of a problem, which
helps explain the spread of tulip cultivation.
At first, tulips were rare in the Netherlands and only for the wealthy. But in the early 17th century, as more bulbs
were produced there, you'd think the prices would come down. In fact, though, the popularity of some tulips
increased tremendously. So demands soon far exceeded supply and their prices skyrocketed. And the tulips most
prized for their uniqueness and beauty were apparently the ones inflected by this mysterious virus. At that time,
nobody was really able to breed tulips like these. Color breaking happened in just two or three out of a hundred
bulbs and seemingly just by chance.
And since you didn't really know when you bought a bulb if the colors would break, well, Dutch speculators
invested hand over fist and drove prices sky high. Some bulbs, even while still in the ground, were sold for as much
as you would pay for a house at the time. But the huge speculative bubble created by this tulip craze eventually
collapsed. And when the prices fell, that wiped out a lot of fortunes almost overnight.
Later on, tulip breeders learned to duplicate color breaking in healthy, uninfected plants, so the spectacular-looking
tulips so common today are the result not of chance viral infections, but of carefully controlled breeding.

TPO 38-Lecture 2 (Congruent and Incongruent Media)
Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a business class.
Professor: Last time we talked about the design and production of advertisements. Today we'll be discussing how
advertisers decide where to display their ads. This is critical to a successful marketing campaign because it builds up
the consumer's brand awareness, their knowledge of a product made by a particular manufacturer. And studies show
that the more you are aware of a product, there's a greater chance you'll buy it.
Now, most ads we see in the media, like in newspapers, television, or magazines, are placed where the product is
matched with a medium of a similar theme.
Let's take...uh...the medium of magazines as an example. If you were to flip through, say, an automotive magazine,
what kind of ads would you expect to find? Jack?
Student: Ads for cars, car parts, tires, stuff like that.
Professor: Good. When you have an ad for a certain product in media with a similar theme, we call that congruent
media. Congruent simply means it fits. It's what you would expect. Congruent media placement is the most logical
choice for marketing a product.
First, it's obvious that people reading a car magazine are interested in cars. So if you place a car ad there, you know
you are reaching the right audience. Also, research shows that when people read an ad in a congruent medium,
afterwards, they have pretty good recall of what was advertised.
Now, there's another approach, that's placing ads in incongruent media. Incongruent media are the magazines,
newspapers, TV spots, where the theme doesn't match the theme of the product. Even though it seems
counterintuitive, research shows that this also is an effective marketing strategy. One study tested this by placing car
advertisements in a magazine that had an incongruent theme and it found that this contributed to consumers' positive
attitudes toward the ad and the car being advertised.
Student: What kind of magazine was it?
Professor: A cooking magazine.
Student: Wow! That worked? I'd have imagined it would be a distraction to see something like that, you know, out
of place.
Professor: Well, keep in mind that potential car buyers don't read only car magazines. Most have other
interests. Many of them probably subscribe to other magazines, a news weekly, a financial publication, something
related to a special interest or hobby. So what marketers have to do then is carefully research potential customers
and look for overlapping interests, which magazine overlaps most with the interests of the car buyer. Then when
they do choose to place ads in incongruent media, they know they'll be effective.
Student: Okay.
Professor: Now this study suggests that because the people reading a cooking magazine didn't expect to see a car ad,
they actually paid more attention. And so for example, when people who like reading about cars see a car ad in a car
magazine, they might pass over it quickly, while here...
Student: They actually took more time to read the ad.
Professor: Right! People paid more attention. They processed the information more carefully when it appears in a
medium with a different theme.This ultimately results in stronger brand awareness, which leads to a more favorable
impression of that product overall. Jenny?
Student: So according to the study, basically when I see an ad in an unexpected place, it'll make me want to buy the
product?
)
Professor: Well, yes and no. The research shows you'll probably remember that ad and you are more likely to feel
positive about that product. Now, whether you'll go out to buy it is a different story.
Of course, there are other factors at work here. You remember those criteria we discussed last week? Anyway, this
explains why most marketers today rely on a mix of congruent and incongruent media.
But there are limits to how incongruent the media should be. You don't want a totally mismatch. So in a magazine
aimed at new parents, you often see car advertisements since parents buy and drive cars. But there are different types
of cars, right? For example, placing an ad here for a big roomie van, which is popular with big families would make
sense, but a snappy sports car with only two seats? Well, that would clearly be too much of a mismatch.
TPO 38-Conversion 2 (Domestic Exchange Program)
Narrator: Listen to a conversation between a student and his ecology professor.
Professor: How is it going? Tom.
Student: Great! I was, oh. I wanted to tell you. You know the guest speaker you brought into class last week from
the wildlife conservation center.
Professor: Susan Brown. Yes. She is an old friend from graduate school.
Student: Her talk on wildlife population modeling, well, it was very theoretical.
Professor: It was certainly a change of pace from what we usually do.
Student: Yeah, but I think I pretty much followed along. Plus, I like to see people get so passionate about ecology.
Professor: Oh, right. Ecology is your major field of study, isn't it? Yes, Susan Brown's certainly a lively
speaker. What a shame she didn't go into teaching.
Student: Uh, anyway, what I, well, a while ago, I saw this blurb in the school paper about an exchange program
that's part of the study abroad office. And today there was booth set up in the student center with a couple of
students answering questions about the university's programs in foreign countries. Seeing the booth reminded me
about the article in the paper and...
Professor: Thinking about going abroad in the coming year?
Student: Actually I just spent last summer studying in Tokyo. I think that satisfied my urge to travel.
Professor: It must've been quite an experience.
Student: Definitely. Taking all those language courses was really challenging. But what I wanted to find out at the
booth was: it's...um...a domestic exchange program, not studying abroad, but studying for a year somewhere else
here in the United States.
Professor: I don't think I have heard of that.
Student: Well, neither had the guys in the booth. They didn't know what I was talking about. But when I talked to
the supervisor in the study abroad office, it turns out we are part of a... a group of universities throughout the US that
does a domestic exchange program.
Professor: Huh! So you spent...what...a year at another university and your classes count toward your degree here?
Student: Yeah, and I paid the same fees, tuition, room and board, that I pay here. So it doesn't really cost any extra.
Professor: Interesting.
Student: And you know I've lived here in southern Florida my whole life. And I've always been interested in
Montana. The university in Montana, where I want to go, has classes that deal specifically with the ecology
)
there. Like I am interested in the greater yellow stone ecosystem. It is such an important ecosystem being the source
of three major rivers, and I want to learn more about it.
Professor: Wow! This is a unique idea. The climate, the plants and wildlife, it's really different from here, probably
the culture too in a way, and don't forget about all the outdoor activities you could do there, hiking, skiing, and the
national parks.
Student: That's true. Anyway I'll have to get my application together in the next month or so, and I'll need two letters
of recommendation, one from a professor in my major department.
Professor: Consider it done.
Student: Thanks.
TPO 38-Lecture 3 (Found Sound)
Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a music history class.
Professor: So let's continue our discussion of twentieth century music. By the early twentieth century, some
composers in Europe and the United States, composers of what's considered classical music, were already moving
away from traditional forms and were experimenting with different ways of composing. In many cases, moving
away from traditional western scales and tonalities.
But as the century progressed, some composers, composers of what was called avant-garde music, went
further. Their experiments with musical composition were not always well accepted. Quite the contrary, you see,
many people felt avant-garde music was too radical and wasn't even legitimate art.
A case in point is the composer John Cage.
Cage was probably the most famous composer of twentieth-century avant-garde music. He didn't begin his music
radical, but as time went on, his musical experiments led him there.
What caused the change?
Two experiences in particular entirely changed how he thought about music. First was his 1951 meeting with the
avant-garde painter Robert Rauschenberg.
Now, avant-garde is a term that applies many different artistic genres. Rauschenberg had created a series of famous
paintings that consisted simply of white paint of different textures on canvas. That's all they were: white.
But the concept of these paintings actually wasn't so simple.
Rauschenberg was asking, in effect, how much could you leave out of an artwork and still have something? Because
in fact, even on a purely white canvas, there's still plenty to see, shadows, dust, reflections.
For Cage, Rauschenberg's white paintings opened up a whole new way of understanding what art could be.
The second key experience in Cage's development came when he stepped in an anechoic chamber. An anechoic
chamber is a room with special walls that absorb sound. Anechoic means without echoes. So an anechoic chamber
was a room where, in theory, you can experience total silence. But Cage entered this room and he heard two sounds,
one high and one low. The high sound, he was told, was his nervous system operating, and the low sound was his
blood circulating.
Cage was profoundly affected. He realized that music doesn't need to be created intentionally. We find it all around
us. This idea came to be called found sound. It's the sounds that are already there, traffic outside your window, or
whatever. For Cage, they were just as musical as sounds made by musical instruments.
These experiences led Cage to create a composition that would convey the idea of found sound. That is, it would
provide an opportunity for the audience to identify random sounds of the environment as music. So he composed a
piece called 4 minutes 33 seconds, commonly known as the silent composition. And this composition was
completely silent, literally. When it was performed the first time, a pianist sat on stage at the piano and the only
)
thing he did was raise and lower the lid of the keyboard to indicate the beginning or ending of a movement. 4
minutes 33 seconds had three movements, but not a note was played in any of them.
Well, the audience was outraged. Music critics called the piece ridiculous. But Cage saw no reason for the
outrage. The fact that the audience was scandalized showed that they missed the whole point of his composition,
which was that there's no such thing as silence, no such thing as a complete absence of sound, and whilst in fact
during that first performance, the sound of wind and rain and people muttering.
Cage had a different understanding of silence. He defined silence as the absence of intended sounds. So to perceive 4
minutes 33 seconds as music, the audience needed to tune in to the sounds around them.
This was quite revolutionary. So we should probably be sympathetic to their reactions at the time. I mean, it's
confounding people even today! Cage's silent composition is still performed all over the world, but I'm afraid to say,
it's often misinterpreted. It's been choreographed, in dance performances for instance, in which case the sound was
the beat of the dancers' feet against the stage floor. And it's been performed by people who made noises on purpose
to call attention to the piece's silence. Can you see why we can consider these performances to be
misinterpretations?
TPO 38-Lecture 4 (The Formation Of Gas Planets)
Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an astronomy class.
Professor: Last week we discussed the formation of Earth and the other rocky planets, of planets in the inner solar
system. Uh, so, what about the gas giants? Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
Well, there's two theories. But first, let's recap. We believe our solar system began as a huge spinning cloud of dust
and gas, which flattened and eventually collapsed in on itself. The matter it's centered condensed into a ball of hot
gas and dust, eventually becoming our sun. And what happened to the remaining cloud?
To the disk encircling the sun when it was a young star?
Student: The rocky planets were born. Um, dust, little grains of rock and metal within the disk collided with each
other and stuck together, and this process sort of snowballed over millions of years until the chunks grew into miniplanets, proto-planets.
Professor: Yeah. This process is called accretion. And we call the disk an accretion disk.
Now, think of it as two parts: an inner accretion disk, and an outer accretion disk. In the inner part, once an object
gets large enough, that object's gravitational field gets stronger, which speeds up the accretion process. You know,
larger objects attract smaller ones and sort of gobble them up.And eventually, you get a full-sized planet in its own
orbit.
Okay. That's how the inner rocky planets probably formed by accretion.
But what about those gas planets in the outer solar system, in the outer accretion disk?
Well, the first theory says the accretion process was similar to the one that formed the rocky planets, with some key
differences.
Remember, the gas giants are farther from the sun, where temperatures are much colder. So, in the outer accretion
disk, compounds like water and ammonia exist in frozen form. Closer to the sun, they're more likely to be vaporized
by solar radiation. What this means is that in addition to rocky and metallic particles there would be other solids like
frozen water and frozen ammonia.
Student: So more solid substances are available to clump into protoplanets, right?
Professor: Precisely! So the solid cores of the gas giants could conceivably have formed by accretion. And once their
mass reaches a certain point, around about 5 to 10 Earths, what would happen?
)
Student: 5 to 10 Earths...uh, with a mass that big, I guess gravity would start to pull in more and more material
faster, right?
Professor: Material, meaning gas. It would rapidly pull in more and more gas from the accretion disk, so you end up
with a solid core of rock, metal and ice surrounded by massive amounts of gas. That's the core accretion
theory. Now, the other theory is called the disk instability theory.
The disk instability theory holds that gas begins the planet-making process, without a solid core. You see, most of
the outer accretion disk would have been gas. We believe solid particles probably made up just one percent of the
outer accretion disk.
So this theory suggests that large planets, the gas giants, uh, they develop from large clumps of mostly gas and some
dust in an accretion disk. Outer regions of an accretion disk can be unstable, gravitationally unstable, which is what
causes these clumps to form, and in some cases, grow in to proto- planets.
Over time, dust particles within a gas clump coalesce, bond together, and eventually fall toward the center, creating
a core. Once this happens, the gas clump grows relatively quickly as its gravity pulls in more and more gas and dust
particles. And this whole process can theoretically happen within one hundred thousand years.

TPO 39-Conversion 1 (Grotowski's Idea About Theater)
Narrator: Listen to a conversation between a student and a theater professor.
Student: Hi, Professor Johns.
Professor: Hey, didn't I see you at the performance of Crimes of the Heart last night?
Student: Yeah. Actually my roommate had a small part in it.
Professor: Really? I was impressed with the performance. There sure are some talented people here. What did you
think?
Student: You know, Beth Henley is an okay playwright. She has written some decent stuff, but it was a little too
traditional, a little too ordinary, especially considering the research I'm doing.
Professor: Oh, what's that?
Student: On the Polish theater director Jerzy Grotowski.
Professor: Grotowski. Yeah, that's a little out of the mainstream. Pretty experimental.
Student: That's what I wanted to talk to you about. I had a question about our essay and presentation.
Professor: Okay.
Student: Yeah. Some of these ideas, uh, Grotowski's ideas are really hard to understand. They are very abstract,
philosophical. And, well, I thought the class would get more out of it if I acted out some of it to demonstrate.
Professor: Interesting idea. And what happens to the essay?
Student: Well, I will do the best I can with that, but supplement it with a performance. You know, bring it to life.
Professor: Alright. But what exactly are we talking about here? Grotowski, as I'm sure you know, had several phases
in his career.
Student: I'm mainly interested in his idea from the late 1960's: poor theater. You know, a reaction against a lot of
props, light, fancy costumes, and all that. So it would be good for the classroom. I wouldn't need anything special.
Professor: Yes. I'm sure a lot of your classmates are unfamiliar with Grotowski. This would be good for them.
Student: Right. And this leads...I think there's overlap between his poor theater phase and another phase of his, when
he was concerned with the relationship between performers and the audience. I also want to read more and write
about that.
Professor: You know, I saw a performance several years ago. It really threw me for a loop. You know, you are used
to just watching a play, sitting back, but this performance, borrowing Grotowski's principles, was really
confrontational, a little uncomfortable. The actors looked right in our eyes, even moved us around, involved us in the
action.
Student: Yeah. I hope I can do the same when I perform for the class. I'm a bit worried since the acting is so
physical. That there's so much physical preparation involved.
Professor: Well, some actors spend their whole lives working on this, so don't expect to get very far in a few weeks,
but I'm sure you can bring a couple of points across. And if you need some extra class time, let me know.
Student: No. I think I can fit it into the regular time for the presentation.
Professor: Okay. I think this will provide for some good discussion about these ideas and other aspects of the
audience and their relationship to theatrical productions.

TPO 39-Lecture 1 (Mineral Evolution)
Narrator: Listen to part of the lecture in a geology class.
Professor: Since Earth formed some four and a half billion years ago, the number of minerals here has increased
dramatically, from a few dozen relatively simple minerals early on to over 4,300 kinds of minerals we can identify
today, many of them wonderfully complex. A basic question of geology is how all these new minerals came into
being. Well, recent studies have turned to biology to try to explain how this happens.
Now, much of biology is studied through the lens of evolution. And the theory of evolution suggests that as
environments change, and inevitably they do, some organisms will have characteristics that allow them to adapt to
those changes successfully, characteristics that help these organisms develop and survive, and reproduce. And when
environments become more complex, as tends to happen over time, those earlier adaptations, those variations,
become the basis of yet other combinations and variations, and lead to ever more diverse and complex forms of
life. So from fewer, simpler and relatively similar forms of life billions of years ago, life on Earth has now become a
dazzling array of diversity and complexity.
Well, some geologists now want to apply this concept to explain mineral diversity too. The conditions that minerals
are under are not constant, conditions like temperature, or pressure, or chemical surroundings. These change, often
in cycles, increasing and decreasing slowly over time. And as conditions change, minerals sometimes break
down. And their atoms recombine into totally new compounds as part of a process some called mineral evolution.
Now, minerals are not alive of course, so this is not evolution in quite the same sense you'd have in living
organisms, but there do appear to be some parallels. Living organisms not only adapt to their environment, but also
affect it, change the environment within which other organisms may then develop. Likewise each new mineral also
enriches the chemical environment from which lots of other even more complex new minerals may be formed in the
future.
Beyond these similarities though, what's really fascinating about mineral evolution is the way minerals apparently
coevolve with living organisms.Uh, what do I mean by that?
Well, it's maybe a billion years after Earth's formation that we first see evidence of life. Of course early life forms
were primitive, just tiny, single-celled microbes, but overtime, they had a profound effect. Huge numbers of these
microbes began producing food by photosynthesis, which of course also freed up enormous amounts of oxygen and
lots of that oxygen interacted with the atoms of existing minerals, creating rust out of iron for instance, reacting with
a whole range of different metals to create lots of new minerals.
Now, living organisms rely on minerals, but they not only take in some minerals as nutrients, they also excrete
others as waste products, including what we call bio minerals, minerals that form with the help of biological life. We
can see geologic evidence of bio mineral production in what are called stromatolites.
Stromatolites look like wavy layers of sedimentary rock, but they are really fossils, fossils of the waste from
microbial masts. Microbial masts are vast colonies of one-celled organisms that were once the most prevalent form
of life on Earth. And the study of stromatolites indicates that these ancient microbial masts interacted with minerals
in the environment and left behind new compounds as waste products. Bio minerals like carbonates, phosphates, and
silica. In fact, we've grown microbial masts in the laboratory. And over time, they too have produced some of the
same sorts of minerals found in stromatolites. Uh, you don't need to know the details of the process right now. We
are still figuring out just how it works ourselves.
But you might be interested to know that this concept of mineral evolution is being used in the search for evidence
of life on other planets. The thinking is that if certain minerals occur here on Earth, as a result of a biological
process, and if we also find those same minerals on another planet, this would suggest that life may have once
existed there!
But just because a particular mineral is found on, say Mars or Venus, we really shouldn't assume that whatever
caused it to turn up there, must be the same process that formed that mineral here on Earth.

TPO 39-Lecture 2 (Community-determined Film)
Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an anthropology class. The professor is discussing ethnography.
Professor: Since ethnography is all about the descriptive study of an individual culture, film has proved to have great
value as a tool for anthropologists in their research. Let's look at a particularly effective approach to ethnographic
film-making, which was developed in the 1970s. This particular style of ethnographic filmmaking is called the
community-determined approach.
The intent of the community-determined approach is to achieve a kind of, uh... shared authorship. See... in this
approach, the goals of the project and how the information will be used are discussed ahead of time, and so a culture,
uh... community is not just the focus of the film. They are actually equal participants in the whole ethnographic
process. In this way the film revolves around the actual values and concerns of the individuals in the community,
and it honors an individual's ethical right to control how he or she is presented in the media. Several of these films
were made in Alaskan communities in the 1970's.
Student: So how does it work, you know, the community-determined part?
Professor: Well, it takes a lot of preparation.
First, way before filming begins, the filmmakers visit the community and meet with the village council who are the
decision-makers of the community. A film if available is shown to the village council so that they get an idea of the
experience of another community. After the meeting, the filmmakers leave and the village council is given all the
time they need to think about what was discussed. Later, if the village council members are interested, they send a
letter or call.
Student: There's no follow-up meeting?
Professor: Not unless they want one. See, this helps remove any pressure to say yes. The social pressure from the
filmmakers' presence.
Student: So, if they agree, then what?
Professor: Then the filmmakers start living in the community. See, another major point in the communitydetermined approach... it's very important that the filmmakers plan to stay in the community for an extended period
of time, not weeks, but months.
And really, there are several reasons for this. Any ideas?
Student: The filmmakers could get a more realistic sense of the pace of life in that community? Uh, its daily rhythm?
Professor: Correct, and it allows the filmmakers to shed some of their assumptions so that they better interpret what
they see.
Student: I bet it also takes the mystery out of the filmmaking process. You know, everyone has time to get used to
the filmmakers and their equipment.
Professor: Exactly, trust is established and relationships are built first.
Student: Wow, this seems like a long process. It must cost a fortune.
Professor: It does. Even with a small film crew any project as involved as this is bound to.
Student: OK, so who decides what goes into the film?
Professor: Well, such decisions are made by general consensus within the community. So, for instance, the
community, not the filmmakers, decide who is to be interviewed for the films. Control of the interview is in the
interviewee's hands. If the person being interviewed says to stop at any time, the recording stops. He or she states
where they wish to be filmed and when and what topic they wish to speak about. The community members review
the footage both midway and at the end of the filming. And if they want any scene deleted, it gets removed. That's
the level of respect and regard for the interviewee's preferences and those of the community in general.
)
Student: So then what language is everything filmed in?
Professor: Excellent question!
Language is culture, isn't it? So the native language, rather than a dubbed voiceover in the filmmakers language, is
the primary language of the film. This way a speaker's emotions and manner of expression really come through, even
if we don't know their language. Subtitles are placed in a secondary position at the bottom of the screen.
Student: And the subtitles probably give only the gist of what's actually being said.
Professor: Yeah, a word for word translation could become too complicated or it'd go by too fast on the screen.
TPO 39-Conversion 2 (Career Fair)
Narrator: Listen to a conversation between a student and an employee in the university career services center.
Employee: Hi. Can I help you?
Student: One of my sociology professors suggested that I come to the career services center and talk to you. She
thought there was going to be a career fair soon where I could talk to different companies about a possible summer
job.
Employee: Well, these are classroom-to-cooperation career fair. That's our largest fair every year. We get
representatives from over 100 companies and they actually conduct interviews right here on campus.
Student: Great! What kinds of companies?
Employee: This year we'll have representatives from all the major technology companies in the area.
Student: Oh. Then I don't know how helpful that will be. I'm a sociology major.
Employee: Well, that's fine. Sociology students often get jobs in marketing, administration, human resources. Tech
companies have openings in those areas.
Student: Well, I'm mainly interested in working with people, in human services.
Employee: Well, in that case, we do have a smaller fair coming up, with smaller companies and some public service
organizations. This one might be a better fit for you.
Student: Yeah. I think that was the one my professor was talking about.
Employee: Most likely. Now, have you been to a fair like this before?
Student: Not really, but I just show up and talk to different companies, right? I don't have to register or anything, do
I?
Employee: No, you don't have to register, but I highly recommend that you come prepared.
Student: Prepared?
Employee: You should dress professionally and have copies of your resume with you.
Student: Copies of my resume? Do I really need that?
Employee: Well, it's not a requirement, but a lot of students come to our career fairs. Plus, we've opened up these
fairs to the public, to people in the neighboring communities. So anything you can do to make yourself look
more...well...look more professional. That's gonna set you apart from the other job applicants.
Student: Um..I don't even have a resume. I've never written one before.
)
Employee: Oh, that's not a problem at all. Have you been to our new website? It has all sorts of information about
how to write a resume. And once you've written it, you can make an appointment to bring it in to us at the career
services center and have someone look at it with you.
Student: Okay. So I really need to have a resume just to get a summer job?
Employee: That depends on the company, but it's a good idea to have one.
Student: Okay. I guess I'll need to have one sooner or later anyway.
Employee: Oh, and we'll be adding other information to our website eventually. Like we'll have a list of the
companies that are going to be at the career fair by the end of the week. You should check it out and then maybe do
some research on the companies. That should help you when you talk to them too.
TPO 39-Lecture 3 (Thoreau's Ideas About Train)
Narrator: Listen to part of the lecture in a literature class. The professor is discussing Henry David Thoreau.
Professor: Nowadays, trains are pretty much taken for granted, but in the United States in the first part of the
nineteenth century, when Thoreau lived, the railroad was a big deal, a technological revolution. It was kind of earthshattering to ride in a mechanical conveyance at fifty kilometers an hour in the 1830's.
The train, or 'iron horse' as people called it, unlocked all sort of new experiences of time and space. Thoreau himself
praised trains for changing the way people experience their own bodies, for stirring the imagination in new ways. So,
in Thoreau's famous book, Walden, as you know, Walden is one of the central literary texts of the United States
from that time period, and in it, Thoreau offers both praise and criticisms of trains.
Um. . .Thoreau is sometimes seen as being anti-modern, but he's not. He uses poetic language, descriptive metaphors
to inspire, to awe his readers, to communicate the fact that the railroad was a feat of human ingenuity.
Thoreau also associates trains with commerce and trade. Though his attitudes toward commerce are complicated, he
credits trains for delivering goods that feed and clothe society, things that improve human life.
But Thoreau also critiques trains on what we could call philosophical grounds. He points out that riding on trains
distorts people's experiences of the natural world. Trees, wild life, landscapes just zip right past you and this is a real
problem for him. Thoreau also worries that trains had become an institution regulating the whole country.
He worries about people doing things in 'railroad fashion', conforming to the train's timetable, letting their lives be
governed by this mechanical device that is making its way into the fabric of society. And he extends this critique to
other inventions of the day, like the penny press, this very fast steam-driven press. He talks about popular literary
genres, like penny newspapers and dime novels, which were being published in mass quantities.
He worries about people no longer thinking for themselves and uncritically accepting all this cheap popular literature
and the trivial details of the news. So Thoreau is offering here a critique of technology that might be relevant for our
own times, and I think it's important to take it seriously. When there is a new invention, a new computer or a mobile
phone technology, some new gadget, there is a tendency to think that we need to have that thing, just as people were
doing in the nineteenth century with respect to railroads. Accepting them as a necessity without considering the
possible negative consequences or trade-offs that can flow from them. Okay. Can anybody offer an example of what
I'm talking about? Deborah?
Student: Yeah, there was this new computer game that my brother just had to have, so he saved his money and
bought it, which was good, I guess that he saved his money and all, but now he spends like all his spare time playing
that game instead of riding bikes with his friends or reading books like he used to do, and it's causing some friction
between him and our parents.
Professor: Perfect example! Deborah. So this is one way to think about Thoreau's text, not just as an important book
in its time, for what it tells us about the nineteenth century, but also as a text that can teach us certain things about
ourselves in contemporary society.
)
TPO 39-Lecture 4 (Potential Alternative Source of Energy-cellulose)
Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a biology class.
Professor: Your reading for today's class was about potential alternative sources of energy. So one thing I want to do
today is consider one of those potential energy sources: cellulose.
Who can tell us what cellulose is? Alan?
Student: Cellulose. Yeah. It's a tough organic molecule made of simple sugars. It's found in the walls of all plant cells, in
grass, trees, all plants. And well, there's more cellulose than any other organic molecule on Earth.
Professor: Good. It's also a potential tremendous source of energy in part because there's so much of it.
Now, many organisms live on the energy they derive from consuming cellulose, like many species of bacteria or cows and
goats. Cows and goats have evolved highly specialized digestive systems that allow them to metabolize cellulose.
Student: But it's hard for most species to process cellulose?
Professor: Yes. And it's been very hard to develop a controlled way to process cellulose in a lab so that we can use the
energy that's stored in it. It needs to be converted into ethanol.
Let me explain. Ethanol is a liquid, a kind of alcohol that's derived from processing sugars from plants, often corn. And it
can be used as fuel. Many researchers believe it is the key to ending the reliance on gasoline.
The problem is that the amount of energy we get from corn-based ethanol isn't much more than the amount of energy that
gets put into making it. So it's not really worth it. Tina?
Student: But ethanol made from cellulose is different?
Professor: Yes. It's possible to get a vastly better energy yield on cellulose-based or cellulosic ethanol.
Student: Okay. So why don't we just use cellulosic ethanol?
Professor: Well, the problem is that the current method for processing cellulose into ethanol is very expensive and can't be
done on a large scale.
See? Currently there are two key steps in the process.
The first is breaking the cellulose down into sugars. This is done with an enzyme, a specific type of protein. And second,
after the enzyme has broken down the cellulose, yeast and other microorganisms, microbes are added to ferment those
sugars into cellulosic ethanol.
Thing is, though, we are not too good at producing the enzymes that break down cellulose. Those proteins are very
difficult to make, to just assemble in a lab. So usually we extract enzymes from microorganisms that produce them
naturally. Unfortunately, this is slow, expensive, and just not very efficient.
Student: So are they trying to develop a better way to make enzymes?
Professor: Actually there's a company that thinks they can do better than that. It'd be more efficient and therefore cheaper
to combine the two steps I mentioned into one. That is, have a single organism that breaks down cellulose and then
produces ethanol. So what this company is doing is searching around the world and gathering naturally occurring
microorganisms that do both things.
I mean, the best key to unlocking the power of cellulose may well lie in a rare species of bacteria or yeast in a jungle
somewhere.
So researchers at this company have discovered some microorganisms that process cellulose and produce ethanol. Now
they are working on enhancing, improving certain natural characteristics of these microorganisms, manipulating them
with sophisticated technology to make them work even more efficiently. The goal, which seems to definitely be within
reach, is to design an engineer, a superbug, a specific kind of microbe, that makes cheap, commercial production of
cellulosic ethanol a really possibility.

Conversation1
Listen to a conversation between a student and a business professor.
第二段
1 .Thanks for seeing me. Professor Jackson.
第三段
1 .Sure, Tom. What can I do for you?
第四段
1 .I'm gonna do my term project on service design.
2 .What you see as a customer, the physical layout of the building, the
parking lot.
3 .And I thought I'd focus on various kinds of eateries: Restaurants, coffee
shops, cafeterias
4 .So I'd also analyze where you order your food, where you eat, and so
on.
第五段
1 .Wait. I thought you were gonna come up with a hypothetical business
plan for an amusement park.
2 .Isn't that what you e-mailed me last week?
3 .I could've sworn...
4 .Oh, I'm thinking of a Tom from another class. Tom Benson. Sorry. Sorry.
第六段
1 .No problem. I did e-mail you my idea too though.
第七段
1 .That's right. I remember now. Restaurants, Yeah.
第八段
1 .So here's my question.
2 .I read something about service standard that kind of confused me.
3 .What's the difference between service design and service standard?
第九段
1 .Service standard refers to what a company...
2 .employees are ideally supposed to do in order for everything to operate
smoothly.
3 .The protocols to be followed.
第十段
1 .Oh, okay.
第十一段
1 .So backing up.
2 .Service design is...uh, think of the cafeteria here on campus.
3 .There are several food counters, right?
4 .All with big, clear signs to help you find what you're looking for: soups,
salads, desserts.
5 .So you know exactly where to go to get what you need.
6 .And when you are finished picking up your food, where do you go?
第十二段
1 .To the cash registers.
第十三段
1 .And where are they?
第十四段
1 .Right before you get to the seating area.
第十五段
1 .Exactly. A place that you would logically move to next.
第十六段
1 .You know, not every place is like that.
2 .This past weekend was my friend's birthday, and I went to a bakery in
town to pick up a cake for her party.
3 .And the layout of the place was weird.
4 .People were all in each other's way, standing in the wrong lines to pay,
to place orders.
5 .Oh, and another thing, I heard this bakery makes really good apple pie,
so I wanted to buy a slice of it too.
第十七段
1 .OK.
第十八段
1 .There was a little label that said apple pie where it's supposed to be but
there wasn't any left.
第一十九段
1 .That's what's called a service gap, maybe there wasn't enough training
for the employees or maybe they just ran out pie that day.
2 .But something is wrong with the process, and the service standard
wasn't being met.
第二十段
1 .OK. I think I get it.
2 .Anyway, since part of the requirements for the term project is to visit an
actual place of business.
3 .Do you think I could use our cafeteria?
4 .They seem to have a lot of the things I'm looking for.
第二十一段
1 .Well, campus businesses like the cafeteria or bookstore don't quite
follow the kinds of service models we're studying in class.
2 .You should go to some other local establishment I'd say.
第二十二段
1 .I see.
第二十三段
1 .But just call the manager ahead of time so they aren't surprised.
Lecture1
Listen to part of a lecture in an art history class.
第二段
1 .Last class I passed out your assignment for your first paper and today I
want to spend some time going over it.
2 .Most people never take any art history until they get to college,
3 .so many of you have probably never written an art history paper before.
第三段
1 .I gave you a list of appropriate works of art for you to write about.
2 .So your next step in this process needs to be to go look at the work
you've selected as your topic and bring a pencil and a notepad with you.
3 .Because I don't mean you should just drop by at the museum and glance
at it, so you can say you've seen it in real life,
4 .you need to go and sit in front of the work and really look at it carefully
and slowly, and keep careful notes about what you see.
5 .You'll need them for the kind of art history paper you are going to be
writing.
6 .It's what we call a formal analysis.
第四段
1 .A formal analysis of a work of art, any kind of art,
2 .is based on its formal qualities, which means qualities related to the
form.
3 .Things like color, texture, line, shapes, proportion and composition.
第五段
1 .Now, probably the closest thing to a formal analysis you might have
written is for an English class.
2 .If, you've, say, written an analysis of a poem, you've used the same
skills.
3 .You've given an analysis of the poem by describing and analyzing its
form and meter.
4 .A formal analysis paper in art history is very similar.
第六段
1 .Now, before you begin writing your formal analysis,
2 .you'll want to start with a summary of the overall appearance of the
work,
3 .a brief description of what you see: either figures, people,
4 .what are they doing, or is it a landscape,
5 .or an abstract representation of something.
6 .Tell what the subject is and what aspects are emphasized in the
painting.
7 .This will give your reader an overview of what the work looks like before
you analyze it.
第七段
1 .The next part of your paper, the actual formal analysis,
2 .would be the longest and most important section of your paper,
3 .where you describe and analyze individual design elements.
4 .For this portion of the paper,
5 .you are going to rely on the notes you took at the museum because you
should be able to describe in detail the design elements the artist uses and
how they are used.
6 .For example, does the artist use harsh lines or soft lines?
7 .Are the colors bright or muted? Focus on the design elements that you
feel are most strongly represented in that particular work of art.
8 .And if you don't know where to begin, take note of where your eye goes
first.
9 .Then describe things in the order in which your eye moves around the
work.
10 .This will help you understand how one part relates to another,
11 .the interaction between the different parts of the work.
12 .Ok? This kind of analysis should occur throughout the main portion of
the paper.
第八段
1 .In the last section of your paper,
2 .and this goes beyond formal analysis,
3 .you comment on the significance of what you've seen,
4 .what details of the work convey meaning.
5 .Some significant details will not be apparent to you right away.
6 .But if you look long enough, you realize how important they are for your
interpretation of the work.
第九段
1 .Many years ago, I was writing a formal analysis of a painting of a little
boy.
2 .In the painting, a little boy was standing in his nursery and he was
holding a toy bird in his hand.
3 .And there were more toys around him in the background of the painting.
4 .Because of the bird he was holding, I assumed at first that the painting
was about the innocence of children.
5 .But as I looked at the painting longer, I realized that the boy's eyes look
sad even though there was no discernable expression on his face.
6 .And then it dawned on me that even though he was surrounded by toys,
he was all alone in his nursery.
7 .The boy's eyes were a significant detail in the painting that I didn't notice
at first.
Lecture2
Listen to part of a lecture in an Environmental Conservation class.
第二段
1 .Next I want to talk about the collapse of the North American Cod
population.
2 .Let's look at Cape Cod in the northeastern United States.
3 .he area was named Cape Cod because there was so many Cod fish in
the waters just off its shores,
4 .so many that the first Europeans who fished there in the 17th century
reported it was better than in New Finland, Canada.
5 .At that time, New Finland's Cod fishery was so rich that people said it
was possible just to lower a bucket in the water,
6 .pull it out and it would be full of cod,
7 .but Cape Cod was even better,
8 .so the fishing industry there did great until after the 1940s. Uh, there
were simply too many fishing vessels,
9 .sophisticated vessels, competing for fewer and fewer fish.
10 .In the 1940s there were still about four hundred million pounds of fish
caught at Cape Cod every year.
11 .Just 50 years later though, by the 1990s,
12 .commercial cod fishing there had become unprofitable.
13 .The annual catch had gone down about 5% of its 1940s' level.
第三段
1 .And here's what's so fascinating:
2 .as more and more fishing vessels with better and better fishing
technology were competing for cod,
3 .this competition was causing changes to the biology of the fish and
these changes were making it more and more difficult for the cod
population to sustain itself.
第四段
1 .Changes to the biology of the fish?
第五段
1 .Well, if a cod fish could reproduce earlier than usual,
2 .it'd have a better chance of passing on its genes to the next generation
before being caught, right?
3 .And sure enough, biologists noticed that around Cape Cod,
4 .the cod were beginning to mature at an earlier age than normal.
第六段
1 .Prior to the population collapse, cod usually took about 8 to 10 years to
fully mature, to start to reproduce,
2 .and they lived around 40 years total.
3 .So cod had about 30 years of active reproductive life.
第七段
1 .But now, cod were beginning to reproduce at a younger age, at 3 to 4
years old,
2 .and they were living shorter lives because they were being caught,
3 .so they had fewer years within which to reproduce.
第八段
1 .Additionally, even though some fish in the population were maturing at
an earlier age,
2 .none was actually growing faster.
3 .No cod has a way of speeding up its rate of growth.
4 .So the younger reproductive age actually meant that smaller fish were
reproducing.
5 .And when you're a small cod reproducing,
6 .you produce fewer eggs than a large cod.
7 .The smaller cods simply don't have the body mass to reproduce as many
eggs.
8 .The overfishing pressure on the cod population was pushing the cod into
an evolutionary corner.
9 .They were having a harder and harder time surviving.
第九段
1 .But what can be done to prevent other scenarios like this?
2 .I mean obviously we need a better way to manage environmental
resources.
第十段
1 .Well, what do you guys suggest? Carol?
第十一段
1 .Hmm, uh, maybe privatize the resource?
2 .A private owner would want to manage the resource efficiently in a
sustainable way.
第十二段
1 .Ok, but the problem is privatization doesn't necessarily result in better
management of an environmental resource.
2 .Any ideas why it wouldn't?
第十三段
1 .Well, an individual owner might not properly assess the limits of the
resource.
2 .So they could be just as prone to overexploiting that resource as a group
where lots of people have access to it.
第十四段
1 .Yes. Well, like in the 1970s,
2 .when it was already clear the North American cod population was
declining dramatically,
3 .the US and Canada declared a 200-mile exclusive economic zone in the
waters around Cape Cod.
4 .By declaring an exclusive economic zone, you see,
5 .these two countries were trying to extend their territorial waters.
6 .Basically it was as if they were saying: 'we're the private owners. We
own these waters. So we own the rights to the fish in them too.
7 .Essentially the two countries told fishing vessels, trollers from all other
nations, to get out of the cod fishing area.
第十五段
1 .You'd think that would be good news for the cod because there'd be less
fishing.
2 .However, The US and Canada wanted to expel foreign trollers only in
order to increase the number of their own fishing fleets.
3 .The total number of fishing trollers actually increased.
第十六段
1 .Another possible solution, pass laws that regulate use of the resource.
2 .But for regulation to be effective, penalties for breaking the law have to
be large enough to deter violators.
Conversation2
Listen to a conversation between a student and a university librarian.
第二段
1 .Mr. Reese. I am Jennifer Lee.
2 .I worked on the photography exhibition last year, the one that was
commemorating the university's 100th anniversary.
3 .I helped select and display photos for the exhibit.
4 .I helped set it all up, remember?
第三段
1 .Oh, sure! You're the photography student that Professor Ryan sent to
us.
2 .How have you been?
第四段
1 .Good. Thanks.
2 .And I...uh...well, I was hoping I could talk to you about a job actually.
第五段
1 .Oh, the job here in our library archive? Ha, that was fast! We just posted
it yesterday.
第六段
1 .Oh, no. Actually, it's for a photography job in the portrait studio at the
mall.
第七段
1 .Taking portrait photos?
2 .Sounds like a great job for a photography student.
3 .But how can I help?
第八段
1 .Well, I went for an interview, but I still need to give them professional
references from people I've worked for.
2 .And well, I don't have a lot of work experience.
3 .But you know, you've...you've seen how...
4 .how I helped plan and carry a project through and showed up on time
and everything.
5 .So, I was kind of hoping I... you know, I could give them your name as
someone they could talk to.
第九段
1 .Of course, we all thought you did a great job.
2 .I remember saying that to Professor Ryan and he thought so too.
3 .I suppose you've already asked him for a recommendation?
第十段
1 .I have. He's actually the one who convinced me to apply for it.
2 .I wasn't sure I should. I mean, having real photography experience
would be great for my resume, but...well...l am little concerned about the
hours.
3 .It's ten hours a week, which is fine, but they're all during the daytime.
4 .I would have to schedule several classes for the late afternoon and
evening.
5 .I am not sure I will be able to do that.
第十一段
1 .Yeah, I see how that could be a problem.
2 .Well, maybe you should consider the job I mentioned.
3 .We just got a grant to hire a part-time library assistant for our
photography archives.
4 .It doesn't involve taking pictures, but it does involve working with
pictures, filling requests for specific photos from students and professors.
5 .And it's in the evenings from 6 to 9, three days a week.
第十二段
1 .Hmm, well, the hours are definitely better, but I really do want to find out
about that job at the studio first.
2 .I am sure you will understand.
Lecture3
Listen to part of the lecture in an environmental science class.
第二段
1 .Now, over the next few weeks, we're gonna focus on carbon and its role
in what's known as the "greenhouse effect."
2 .Everyone knows what that is, right?
3 .But let's make sure anyway.
4 .Yes, Karlie?
第三段
1 .The greenhouse effect is when gases in Earth's atmosphere act like the
glass in a greenhouse or a hothouse.
2 .They trap in heat which warms up the earth.
第四段
1 .Gases Gases.
第五段
1 .Um, water vapor? Carbon dioxide?
第六段
1 .Right. Carbon dioxide.
2 .We hear a lot about carbon these days, no?
3 .Carbon emissions, carbon burning, leaving a carbon footprint.
4 .So it'd be easy to assume that any form of carbon burning is necessarily
a bad thing.
5 .But the fact is: it's not quite that simple.
6 .So we're gonna focus today on the difference between good, bad, and
well, the, not so bad, the potentially okay carbon burning.
第七段
1 .OK. Good carbon burning.
2 .Well, we all have a personal stake in this because burning carbon is the
basis of life.
3 .We wouldn't be here if we ourselves weren't burning carbon.
4 .Basically, all living things burn carbon to survive.
5 .Usually this happens at the cellular level and what's burned is carbon in
the form of sugars, glucose.
第八段
1 .Oxygen gets chemically combined with sugars in our cells and the
energy produced from that reaction is then used to power the cells.
2 .So just by breathing you could say we are all guilty of carbon emission
and contribute to the amount of carbon in the atmosphere.
第九段
1 .Um, another thing about atmospheric carbon: it keeps us from freezing.
2 .Because without carbon and other greenhouse gases, our planet would
be the same temperature as outer space,
3 .around four degrees above absolute zero.
4 .And there's nothing going on at that temperature.
5 .No possibility of life of any sort.
6 .So without atmospheric carbon, life couldn't exist on Earth.
第十段
1 .Now, another thing to remember is that carbon is always being removed
from the atmosphere.
2 .It gets used up.
3 .Largely it is consumed by plant life through photosynthesis.
4 .Also, it dissolves in the oceans or gets stored deep in the ocean.
5 .You have shellfish that use the CO2 dissolved in the water to make
carbonate shells and when they die, they fall to the ocean floor and the
carbon gets sequestered down there.
第十一段
1 .So with all this carbon constantly being depleted from the atmosphere,
we really need to keep carbon output up to a certain point.
第十二段
1 .So why all the bad press for burning carbon?
第十三段
1 .Well, turns out it's the source of the carbon being burned that's the key.
2 .It's in fact the burning of what we call "fossil carbon" that creates the
imbalance: fossil fuels, coal, oil, natural gas.
第十四段
1 .These substances are all mined.
2 .We have to dig them up or drill a well to release them.
3 .And this is carbon that was in the atmosphere millions of years ago.
第十五段
1 .So what happens is: when we burn this carbon,
2 .ok, it doesn't really release a whole lot compared to the amount that's
already there in the atmosphere,
3 .but it adds to the pool.
4 .And over years it accumulates.
第十六段
1 .Think of the atmosphere as a big bathtub.
2 .It's basically already filled to the brim with carbon.
3 .When we start adding fossil carbon into the mix, it starts to spill over.
4 .That being said, there's actually a category that's in-between: what we
call biomass fuels, probably the most common one is wood.
第十七段
1 .Another example, um, on the North American plains, the Native
Americans used to collect buffalo droppings to burn.
2 .Uh, in Ireland, they cut up peat from bogs and they burn that.
第十八段
1 .So what's the big distinction between this and fossil carbon?
第一十九段
1 .Biomass carbon is what we might call current carbon.
2 .It's always going in and out of the atmosphere.
3 .So if we burn one of these fuels, we're putting its carbon into
atmosphere. Right?
4 .But in a balanced system, somewhere else in the world the same
amount of carbon is going back.
5 .It gets taken in by growing vegetation.
6 .So burning biomass fuel produces sort of not-so-bad carbon.
7 .In fact, it can become good carbon if we endeavor as a society, as
humanity,
8 .to allow forests to recover this carbon,
9 .if we don't, say, pave over all the surfaces to prevent things from
growing.
10 .So whenever we cut down a tree and burn its wood, we have to allow
another tree to grow to keep things in balance.
11 .That way, you're...you're carbon neutral.
Lecture4
Listen to part of a lecture in a United States Government class.
第二段
1 .We've been talking about the basic services and facilities that an
economy needs to function,
2 .roads, bridges, rail systems, water supplies, power grids, and so forth.
3 .What we call infrastructure.
第三段
1 .Now, traditionally much of a society's infrastructure, particularly the
transportation infrastructure,
2 .has been owned and operated by states, by governments.
3 .But lately, local and state governments have started to consider and
sometimes actually enter into various deals to privatize parts of their
infrastructure, particularly in the transportation sector.
第四段
1 .And why is this privatization happening?
第五段
1 .Well, as you may know, in the 1950s and 60s there was a tremendous
highway building boom.
2 .Governments created a huge interlocking network of highways with
associated bridges and tunnels.
3 .But these facilities are getting old now and they're becoming more and
more expensive to maintain,
4 .very expensive actually.
5 .Tolls and tax revenues don't often cover all the needed repairs.
第六段
1 .So why don't the governments just raise tolls and taxes?
第七段
1 .Well, that's not so simple.
2 .Government officials are elected by voters and voters get upset when
their taxes go up.
3 .And as for highways tolls,
4 .commuters especially don't like paying higher tolls,
5 .merely proposing increases can damage political careers.
第八段
1 .So there's tremendous pressure on governments to find other ways to
maintain infrastructure assets.
2 .One solution is to sell or lease a part of the infrastructure,
3 .a toll bridge, a tunnel, something like that to a private company,
4 .usually a company that specializes in this sort of thing.
5 .The idea is that the company that buys or leases a bridge or a highway
or whatever will find it easier to keep it in good repair.
第九段
1 .That will make commuters happy.
第十段
1 .Right, there could be better service.
2 .Since they are not government entities,
3 .private companies face less political resistance, say to raising tolls in
order to provide that better service.
4 .But besides that, there's another reason governments like these deals.
5 .States often have trouble paying their bills and they can use money they
get from selling or leasing a piece of infrastructure to balance their
budgets.
第十一段
1 .That all sounds good to me.
第十二段
1 .It does sound good,
2 .but a lot of people are very wary of privatizing pieces of infrastructure
and rightly so.
3 .For instance, in almost every case thus far,
4 .the first thing private companies do is drastically raise user fees because
they say,
5 ."Oh, we must do critical maintenance that's gone undone for years and
years.
6 .And because we're a private company,
7 .we can't use tax money to do it.
8 .Our only option is raising tolls.
第十三段
1 .But what's the impact on people who use a toll road to get to work?
2 .What if a private owner doubles or triples the toll overnight?
第十四段
1 .Uh, users would have to spend a higher percentage of their income on
commuting.
第十五段
1 .And depending on their income, that percentage could be significant.
第十六段
1 .But if tolls went up, me, I'd just avoid the toll road and take smaller back
roads where there aren't any tolls.
第十七段
1 .That's a good point.
2 .Secondary roads would become attractive to lots of other people too,
3 .and private companies know this.
4 .They also know that dramatic reductions in traffic would hurt their bottom
line.
5 .So market forces do play a role in keeping private companies from
raising their tolls too much.
6 .But the mere prospect of astronomical toll hikes is still alarming to
governments when they think about selling or leasing parts of an
infrastructure.
第十八段
1 .Now, from a business standpoint,
2 .infrastructure purchases can be great investments!
3 .If a company buys or gets a long-term lease on a toll bridge from the
government,
4 .it's got an almost guaranteed steady source of revenue for years and
years,
5 .which means that if the company decides it wants to sell the bridge to
another company, say ten years from now,
6 .it'll have no problem finding a buyer.
第一十九段
1 .But what if that buyer, this new owner, ontinues to charge a high toll but
doesn't do the same amount of maintenance because they want to
squeeze more money out of the asset!
第二十段
1 .In that case, could the governments buy the asset back?
2 .Well, to do that, it would have to raise money either by raising taxes or
by selling bonds, both of which are politically sensitive.
第二十一段
1 .So it's unclear in a practical sense whether these deals are truly
reversible.
TPO41
Conversation1
Listen to a conversation between a student and his professor.
第二段
1 .I have some good news for you.
2 .One of the students who was signed up for the summer term at the field
station next year won't be attending after all. Your name's first on the
waiting list.
3 .So if you still want to do it, the space is available.
第三段
1 .Oh, that's terrific!
第四段
1 .You were also interested in doing an independent research project next
summer, right?
第五段
1 .Yeah, on salt marsh restoration, but that was before, when I thought I
wasn't going to get into the field station.
第六段
1 .Well, you can still do it if you want.
2 .I looked over your application for the independent research project, and
it looks strong. I approved it.
3 .And you'd have even more resources there at the field station, so...
第七段
1 .The field station and an independent study, but the summer term is a
few weeks shorter than a regular term.
第八段
1 .Well, it's up to you.
2 .You'd have to work hard but I think you can do very well.
3 .Professor Garfield, one of the professors over at the field station...
第九段
1 .Yeah, I've heard of him.
第十段
1 .Yes, well. Professor Garfield has been doing research on salt marshes
for years, assessing human impact and methods of salt marsh restoration.
2 .He is willing to oversee your project.
第十一段
1 .Wow!
2 .That's too good an opportunity to pass up.
第十二段
1 .I thought you'd say that.
2 .When I spoke with Dr. Garfield, he suggested you take a particular
course he'll be teaching here in the spring.
3 .It's called advanced topics in salt marsh management.
4 .The course looks at salt marsh ecology in depth and it also focuses on
factors that stress salt marsh systems and how to assess and monitor the
level of stress.
第十三段
1 .And that background information will fit right into my project on salt
marsh restoration. This is so great!
第十四段
1 .Oh, one more thing. Do you know John Arnold?
第十五段
1 .Not really, but he lives in my dorm. Why?
第十六段
1 .John's another ecology student who will be the Field Station next
summer.
2 .I approved an independent research project for him, too. Initially, he had
the same concern as you.
第十七段
1 .But anyway, his topic will be similar to yours.
2 .He'll be researching how bridges and culverts1 that have been installed
to allow tidal waters to move underneath roads between the sea and the
salt marshes.
3 .Well, they are often too small.
第十八段
1 .I guess that would result in not enough tidal water flowing into the
marshes to maintain the natural vegetation, right?
第一十九段
1 .Exactly, and he'll be looking at how to determine the right size.
2 .So I was thinking he might be a good choice for a summer roommate for
you.
Lecture1
Listen to part of a lecture in a botany class.
第二段
1 .Many organisms have developed the ability to survive in harsh
environmental conditions: extreme heat or cold, or very dry conditions.
2 .Like plants in the desert.
3 .Your textbook doesn't have much about the specifics on desert plants,
but I think that desert plants are great examples of specialized adaptations
to extreme environmental conditions.
第三段
1 .So, with desert plants, there are basically three different adaptive
strategies.
2 .And I should point out that these strategies are not specific to any
particular species.
3 .Many different species have developed each of the adaptations.
第四段
1 .So, first off, there are succulent plants.
第五段
1 .There are many different species of succulent plants, but they all can
absorb and store a lot of water.
2 .Obviously, opportunities to get water in the desert are few and farbetween.
3 .Generally rains are light and short.
4 .So the rain doesn't seep too far down into the soil.
5 .And there's a limited window of time for any plant to get the water before
it evaporates.
第六段
1 .But succulent plants have a spread-out and shallow root system that can
quickly pull in water from the top inches of soil, though the soil has to be
saturated since succulents aren't good at absorbing water from soil that's
only a little moist.
第七段
1 .Succulent plants also are well suited to retaining water, important in an
environment where rainy days are rare.
2 .Succulent plants can store water in their leaves, in their stems, or in their
roots.
第八段
1 .And to keep that moisture from evaporating in the hot, desert Sun, most
succulent plants have a waxy outer layer that makes them almost
waterproof when their stomates are closed.
第九段
1 .They also preserve water by minimizing their surface area.
2 .The more of the plant that's out in the Sun, the more potential there is to
lose stored-up water.
3 .And that means that most succulent plants have few, if any, leaves.
第十段
1 .Now, besides succulent plants, there're also drought-tolerant plants.
2 .Drought-tolerant plants are like bears in a way.
3 .You know how bears mostly sleep through the winter.
4 .They can survive without eating because their metabolism slows down.
5 .Well, drought-tolerant plants also go into a dormant state when
resources, in their case, water, run short.
6 .A drought-tolerant plant can actually dry out without dying.
第十一段
1 .I said before that most desert rains are light and brief, but occasionally
there is a heavy one.
2 .Drought-tolerant plants revive after one of these significant rainfalls.And
they are able to absorb a good bit of the rainfall due to their deep roots.
3 .Actually the root system for drought-tolerant plants is more extensive
than the root systems of many plants that live in wetter climates.
4 .Droughttolerant plants can even absorb water from relatively dry soil
because of their deep roots in contrast to succulent plants.
第十二段
1 .The third adaptive strategy is to avoid the drought conditions altogether.
2 .Yes! There ARE plants that do this: Annual plants!
第十三段
1 .An annual plant will mature and produce seeds in a single season that
will become the next generation of annual plants.
2 .In desert conditions, annual plants grow in the fall or spring to avoid the
heat of summer and the cold of winter.
3 .Of course, these plants could face a serious problem if a particular fall or
spring happened to be very dry.
4 .They would have difficulty growing and could die before producing
seeds.
第十四段
1 .But they have a mechanism to prevent one year of low rainfall from
wiping them out.
2 .Not all seeds an annual plant puts out will grow the following year.
3 .Some seeds remain dormant in the ground for several years.
4 .It's a type of insurance that protects the annual plants from a season of
poor growing conditions, of unfavorable weather.
Lecture2
Listen to part of a lecture in an American History class.
第二段
1 .It's interesting how much we can learn about culture in the United States
by looking at how Christopher Columbus has been portrayed throughout
United States' history.
2 .So let's start at the beginning.
第三段
1 .Columbus' ships first landed in a... landed in the Caribbean.
2 .There's some debate about which island.
3 .He landed in 1492, but it wasn't until 300 years later in 1792 that his
landing was first commemorated.
4 .And this was the brainchild of John Pintard.
第四段
1 .Pintard was a wealthy New Yorker, the founder of the New York
Historical Society.
2 .And he decided to use his influence and wealth to find a great hero, a
patron for the young country.
3 .And he chose Columbus.
第五段
1 .And in New York, in 1792, the anniversary of Columbus's landing was
commemorated for the first time.Now, other cities, uh, Philadelphia and
Baltimore followed. And...
第六段
1 .But why Columbus?
2 .And why there?
第七段
1 .Well, to Pintard it was a way to build patriotism in the young, politically
fractured country.
2 .Remember, the United States had only declared its independence from
Britain 16 years earlier, and had yet to form a national identity.
第八段
1 .Pintard also had a hand in helping to create Independence Day, you
know, July 4th; as a national holiday.
2 .So you see that he was very involved in creating sort of a national story
for Americans.
3 .And Columbus, he felt Columbus could become a story that Americans
could tell each other about their national origins that was outside of the
British colonial context.
4 .The United States was in search of a national identity.
5 .And its people wanted heroes.
第九段
1 .But why not some of the leaders of the revolution?
2 .You know, like George Washington.
第十段
1 .The leaders of the revolution were the natural candidates to be heroes,
but many were still alive and didn't want the job.
2 .To them, being raised to hero status was undemocratic.So Columbus
became the hero.
3 .And the link between Columbus and the United States took hold.
第十一段
1 .And so what was that link?
第十二段
1 .Well, Columbus was portrayed as entrepreneurial, someone who took
chances, who took risks, and he was cast as somebody who was opposed
to the rule of kings and queens.
2 .Perhaps most of all, Columbus was portrayed as someone who was
destined to accomplish things, just as America in those early years was
coming to see itself as having a great destiny.
第十三段
1 .But Columbus was supported by the king and queen of Spain. He wasn't
against them.
第十四段
1 .True.
2 .To be historically accurate, the way Pintard thought about Columbus
doesn't match up with the facts of his life at all.
3 .And I really have to stress this: the fact that Columbus became the hero
of a young country had little to do with Columbus, anything he did, and a
lot to do with what was happening in the United States 300 years later.
第十五段
1 .Columbus was extraordinarily adaptable to the purposes of America's
nation builders, people like John Pintard in the early part of the 19th
century.
2 .And since not a lot of facts were known about Columbus, because
writings weren't available in North America until...until 1816.
3 .That might have actually helped the process of adapting him to American
purposes.
第十六段
1 .Since no one knew much about the real Columbus, it was easy to invent
a mythical one?
第十七段
1 .Exactly.
2 .And this mythical Columbus, it became a reflection of the society which
chose him.
第十八段
1 .So in the early history of the United States, Columbus represented an
escape from the political institutions of Europe.
2 .He was the solitary individual who challenged the unknown.
3 .And now there was this new democracy, this new country in a world
without Kings.
4 .Columbus became sort of the mythical founder of the country.
第一十九段
1 .So as historians, we wouldn't want to study these myths about Columbus
and mistake them for facts about Columbus.
2 .But if we are trying to understand American culture, then we can learn
much by studying how America adapts Columbus for its own purposes.
第二十段
1 .Evaluations of Columbus then will reflect what Americans think of
themselves.
2 .Oh, there is a quote, something like, ¡°societies reconstruct their past
rather than faithfully record it ."
3 .And how that reconstruction takes place and what it tells us, that's
something we are going to be paying a lot of attention to.
Conversation2
Listen to part of a conversation between a student and a university
employee.
第二段
1 .Hi, can I help you?
第三段
1 .Yes, I'd like to get help with the, you know, payment for my classes,
some sort of financial aid.
2 .The problem is I don't know much about it, so I don't really know where
to begin.
3 .I saw this poster about work-study programs.
4 .Can you tell me something about that?
第四段
1 .Well, I think you're talking about the government sponsored work-study
program.It works like this: you work on campus and get paid an hourly
wage just like a regular job.
2 .However, instead of getting a paycheck, the money goes directly to your
bill for your courses, but almost all work-study jobs pay minimum wage,
which is usually pretty low.
3 .The truth is: you might do better getting a job off campus since you can
do whatever you want with the money, like paying your rent or...or buying
textbooks.
第五段
1 .Thanks!
2 .That's very useful.
3 .So how do I find out what's out there?
第六段
1 .Let me show you our catalogue of various programs as well as
scholarships offered here.
2 .That's your best bet1 really, if you can find a good scholarship, because
you don't have to pay the money back.
3 .You might qualify if your grades are good enough or if you have the right
background.
第七段
1 .Yeah, that sounds like something I should try for.
第八段
1 .Now, this is my desk-copy of the catalogue, but I can give you your own
copy if you want. Oh yeah, be sure to visit the university library, too.
2 .There's a whole section on financial aid including application forms.
第九段
1 .Why isn't all the information listed in the catalogue? It'd be so much
easier.
第十段
1 .Oh, if we did that, the catalogue would be too heavy to pick up.
2 .City clubs, foundations, organizations from all over the country offer
scholarships or other financial assistance to college students, and all kinds
of companies have programs to help their employees' children go to
college.
3 .If either of your parents works for a large corporation, have them check
to see if their companies do that.
第十一段
1 .Okay. Good idea.
2 .Hey, my dad works for a big accounting firm and he's a member of a
professional accounting organization.
3 .Do you think they'd offer financial aid?
第十二段
1 .Yes, that's fairly common, especially if you are planning to go into
accounting.
2 .What are you studying?
3 .What do you plan to do after you graduate?
第十三段
1 .I want to become a dentist.
2 .I'm enrolled in a pre-med program for dentistry.
第十四段
1 .Okay. So Td suggest looking in the library for information on
organizations that have to do with dentistry.
2 .Any number of them might offer scholarships to students planning to join
their profession.
第十五段
1 .I'll definitely investigate that one.
第十六段
1 .Great! But be sure to talk to one of our librarians, too.
2 .They get the same questions over and over, so they can save you a
great deal of time.
Lecture3
Listen to part of a lecture in an art history class.
第二段
1 .OK. As art historians, one of our fundamental tasks is to assign
authorship to works of art, right?
2 .We're presented with a work of art, and we have to figure out who made
it.
3 .But this task becomes particularly difficult when we're dealing with works
produced in Italy during the Renaissance, the 16th, 17th centuries.
第三段
1 .Now, why is this the case?
2 .Anyone? Emily.
第四段
1 .Um...is it 'cause artists didn't sign their work?
2 .I mean, didn't the whole concept of the artist as an individual developed
later? In like the 19th century?
第五段
1 .Well, you are sort of on the right track.
2 .The concept of the individual artist, especially the concept of the artist as
an artistic genius struggling alone with a vision as opposed to...say...a
mere artisan...well, the idea of the artist as a lone genius didn't develop
until later.
第六段
1 .But artists, individual artists, did sign their work during the Renaissance.
2 .In fact, you could say that's part of the problem.
3 .Paintings were signed by the artist and that used to be understood to be
a mark of Renaissance's individualism.
4 .If a piece had Raphael's signature on it, we assume it was done by the
great artist himself Raphael, in the singular.
第七段
1 .But you see, art in Renaissance Italy was very much a collaborative
business.
2 .Painters and sculptors worked in a workshop.
3 .It was almost like a small business run by a master artist.
第八段
1 .You see, to deal with a wide variety of commissions they received,
orders basically, for specific types of art, specific projects, to handle these,
master artists often employed assistants as apprentices.
2 .And this was especially so if they worked on a large scale, huge
paintings or sculptures, or if they were much in demand, like Raphael, for
instance.
第九段
1 .He worked on some large paintings.
2 .He painted frescos for the Vatican1.
3 .He also received a great many commissions.
4 .There's no way he could have completed every part of every project all
by himself.
第十段
1 .Now, these assistants might work for the master artist on a temporary or
a permanent basis.
2 .And they might also specialize.
3 .For example, in Raphael's workshop, which might be called Raphael
incorporated, one of the assistants specialized in animals.
4 .He actually painted a good number of the animals in Raphael's art.
5 .It maybe that a master signing a work was simply making a declaration
that the work met the standards of the shop.
第十一段
1 .And it wasn't just painters.
2 .Sculptors also worked together.
3 .In fact, assistants were even more necessary if you were a master
sculptor because statues take longer to make than paintings.
4 .And the master had to arrange for marble to be quarried, things like that.
第十二段
1 .Perhaps the most collaborative of all was architecture.
2 .There we see a real division of labor, but with carpenters, masons,
unskilled labor just to carry materials to and fro, and so on.Plus, of course,
your skilled artisans who carried out the master architect's design.
3 .Think of it, like, um, a ballet, you know.
4 .All the dancers work together.
5 .There's a division of labor. People have different roles.
6 .And in order for the thing to come together, everyone needs to be aware
of what others are doing and coordinate their work and have good timing.
第十三段
1 .So for architecture, it's almost impossible to know who was responsible
for any given detail.
2 .Was it the master architect?
3 .The mason? An assistant mason?
4 .Maybe it was even the patron, the client who was paying for the art.
第十四段
1 .Remember, it wasn't yet customary for architects to give their assistants
measured drawings to work from.
2 .Instructions were given orally, not in writing. So we don't have those
documents to tell us what exactly the master architect's plans were.
3 .The only time we have written records is when the architect wasn't
actually there.
4 .Perhaps the architect was away on business and had to write out
instructions and send them to the shop.
第十五段
1 .And another thing to think about: What effect do you suppose this
approach would have had on innovation?
第十六段
1 .I mean, since the hired artisans had been trained by other artisans, they
tended to be trained to use traditional styles and techniques.
2 .So if you're a master architect, uh, you've developed your own style.
3 .Say you're calling for certain detail in the building you're designing,
right?
4 .And say this detail is different, purposely different, from the established
tradition, the established style.
第十七段
1 .Well, most likely when the hired artisans would execute the design,
rather than follow the intended design, they would stick with the more
traditional style that they were familiar with.
2 .Workers would have to be supervised very closely to prevent this from
happening.
3 .Otherwise, as it often happened, there goes the designer's style and
creativity.
Lecture4
Listen to part of a lecture in an astronomy class.
第二段
1 .OK. We've been discussing the planets in our solar system and how
some of the ones farthest from the sun were discovered.
2 .Well, today I'd like to turn to what are called exoplanets and how
researchers detect them. Maria?
第三段
1 .Exoplanets are planets that orbit around a star other than our Sun, right?
2 .They are not in our solar system.
第四段
1 .Right.
2 .They have different...what are called "host stars".
3 .And the study of exoplanets has been getting more and more exciting.
Hundreds of them have been discovered so far.
4 .This is quite remarkable in view of the fact that the discovery of the first
exoplanets was confirmed only in the mid-1990s.
5 .Now we're finding new ones every few weeks or so.
第五段
1 .So, uh, exactly why are we interested in these exoplanets anyway?
2 .Is it to see if there's life on them?
3 .Cuz it seem to me like the only exoplanets we ever hear about are gas
giants like Jupiter and Saturn that couldn't possibly support carbon-based
life.
第六段
1 .OK. Well, let's talk about that.
第七段
1 .First, as for discovering life.
2 .Well, I think that sort of discovery is pretty far in the future, but it is an
eventual goal.
第八段
1 .For now, the focus is on locating planets within a host star's so called
"habitable zone", a zone that's a certain distance from its star because only
planets within this zone could conceivably support carbon-based life.
第九段
1 .So, what would such a planet need?
第十段
1 .Water?
第十一段
1 .Yes, it need to be the right temperature to sustain liquid water.
第十二段
1 .And it would need to be a rocky planet, I mean, as opposed to a gas
giant.
第十三段
1 .OK, good. An Earth-like planet.
第十四段
1 .Now, as to that, there are some recently detected exoplanets that might
actually be Earth-like.
第十五段
1 .For example, there's a red dwarf star, that's what most stars are, um...
that's called Gliese 581.
第十六段
1 .Gliese 581 is... well, it's a lot more interesting than that name makes it
seem.
2 .This host star is considered a near neighbor of our solar system because
it's only about 20 light years away.
3 .It's pretty close by astronomical standards.
4 .And being a red dwarf star, it's small and relatively cool, at least
compared with the Sun.
第十七段
1 .And researchers have discovered planets orbiting Gliese 581.
2 .These exoplanets have been named, ready? Gliese 581 b, c, d, e, in
alphabetical order of their discovery.
第十八段
1 .Gliese 581 d and e are the planets I wanna focus on now.
2 .See, in 2009, a group of researchers made an announcement.
3 .These two exoplanets: Gliese 581 d and e do have some Earth-like
qualities.
4 .Gliese 581 d had actually been discovered a couple of years earlier.
5 .And when its orbit was originally calculated it was thought to be too far
away from its host star to be warm enough to support a liquid ocean, let
alone carbon-based life.
6 .But then its orbit was recalculated and now we see that Gliese 581 d is
within its host's habitable zone.
第一十九段
1 .So it might have an ocean?
第二十段
1 .Well, conceivably.
第二十一段
1 .See, Gliese 581 d weighs 7 times what Earth weighs and it's unlikely that
it's made entirely of rocks because it's so massive.
2 .The researchers studying it said that it could have a rocky core, an ice
layer, a large deep ocean and an atmosphere.
第二十二段
1 .OK, and there was another announcement along with the recalculated
orbit of Gliese 581 d.
2 .That was the discovery of another planet in the system, Gliese 581 e.
3 .Compared with other exoplanets, its mass is quite small, only about
twice that of Earth.
第二十三段
1 .So 7 is Gliese 581 e a more Earth-like planet?
第二十四段
1 .Well, we have to consider its orbit.
2 .Gliese 581 e orbits its host star in a much shorter period of time than the
other planets in the system, meaning it's very close to the star, and
therefore too hot for water, for an ocean.
第二十五段
1 .However, the fact that it's relatively close to the size of Earth, small, in
astronomical terms, that was pretty exciting.
2 .It's impressive that we have the technology to detect it and it bodes well
for future research.
3 .Who knows what we'll find the more we search.
TPO42
Conversation1
Listen to a conversation between a student and an art history professor.
第二段
1 .Hi. Tm Melisa.
2 .I was just a few doors down getting some help in the computer lab.My
electronic files won't open.
3 .The technician says it's probably a computer virus. She's working on it
now.
第三段
1 .Yes, from what Tve heard lots of campus computers have been affected.
2 .What a first week! Huh?
第四段
1 .I know, anyhow, I noticed your name on the door as I was walking down
the hallway, thought I'd stop in and find out if you happen to have any
additional copies of the class syllabus.
2 .The one I received in class the other day is missing a page.
第五段
1 .Oh, sorry about that.
2 .I probably have a few extra printouts on hand.
第六段
1 .Great! Oh, and I noticed on the syllabus we'll be learning about and
eventually writing a paper on "The Bauhaus1 style of art"?
2 .Sounds interesting. Tm looking forward to it.
第七段
1 .Right, but technically it doesn't say Bauhaus style of art.It only says the
Bauhaus.
第八段
1 .Oh, what's the difference?
第九段
1 .Well, the Bauhaus is not really an artistic style like cubism.
2 .It was the name of an art and design school in Germany in the early 20th
century.
3 .The Bauhaus was started as an experiment in education, and one
ground-breaking technique used in its teaching was that students actively
participated in workshops instead of just sitting in classes.
第十段
1 .Interesting! I don't have much background in order or anything.
2 .I'm an economics major and Tm taking this class as an elective, decided
I wanted to broaden my awareness, try something new!
第十一段
1 .Excellent! Tm really glad to hear that.
第十二段
1 .So, was the focus of the Bauhaus architecture, I mean, I studied German
and Bauhaus translates into "house for building"...
第十三段
1 .Well, the founding director was an architect.However, he aimed to
combine an incredibly broad variety of fine arts and crafts under one
artistic roof.
2 .As a matter of fact, when the Bauhaus first opened, it was without an
architecture department for several years.
3 .But later, it became very influential in architecture.
第十四段
1 .So I wasn't all wrong.
第十五段
1 .You'll see on the syllabus that you are required to visit the Rutherford
Museum exhibit.
2 .The exhibit will help you see that there is no single Bauhaus style.
第十六段
1 .I think it;s refreshing that this particular exhibit departs from the standard
ways in which art from the Bauhaus is often presented.
第十七段
1 .Which are?
第十八段
1 .Well, for example, by a specific artist.
2 .I think it's a mistake to focus on a single Bauhaus artist and that person's
individual specialty.I mean, the different artists from the school created
different things: fabric, sculpture, furniture, graphic design, paintings, even
theatrical performances.
3 .The exhibit in the Rutherford Museum units all these specialties through
connecting themes such as motion or the body.
第一十九段
1 .Sounds fascinating!
2 .Say, I've heard of something about discount nights at that museum?
第二十段
1 .Weekends are full price.
2 .It's typically best to go Thursday nights.
3 .That's student discount night, 50% off However, next Wednesday is
open to the public for free.
4 .It's a special promotion.
5 .So I know what I would do.
Lecture1
Listen to part of a lecture in an art history class.
第二段
1 .I am sure you've all been to museum, where you've seen beautiful white
marble statues sculpted by the Greeks and Romans, or at least that you've
seen photos of such statues, right?
2 .We've come to expect these classical Greek and Roman statues to be
monochrome, just one color, white skin, white hair, white eyes, white
everything, the natural color of the marble they're carved from.
第三段
1 .Now, the ideal of plain white sculpture goes back to 15th century Europe
when Renaissance artists rediscovered ancient Greek and Roman culture.
2 .They were inspired by sculptures that appeared monochrome so they
created white marble statues.
3 .The impact of these Renaissance statues, such as Michelangelo's David,
gave rise to new standards for sculpture, standards that emphasized form
rather than color.
第四段
1 .But what if many of those ancient statues were originally polychrome,
colored from head to toe?
第五段
1 .Early in the 19th century, archeologists found traces of paint on ancient
sculptures and since then, classical art historians have begun to realize
that Greek and Roman marble sculptures were originally colored.
第六段
1 .Even if an ancient marble statue doesn't have any visible traces of paint,
that does not mean it was originally monochrome.
第七段
1 .In many cases, the pigment would've simply deteriorated.
2 .Ancient artists used mineral-based paints with organic binding media
that would've disintegrated on its own overtime.
第八段
1 .In other cases, the pigment may have been weathered away while
exposed to the elements or someone may have rigorously cleaned the
statues and unknowingly removed the last traces of pigment.
第九段
1 .So, the fact is, we do have evidence of polychrome sculptures from
Greece and Rome from the 7th century B.C.E. all the way through at least
the third or fourth century C.E.
2 .It's now generally accepted that most, maybe even all marble sculptures
from that time period, receive some kind of surface treatment, like the
application of pigments, colored stones or metals that would've modified
their color.
第十段
1 .So do we interpret the statue differently if we had known it had originally
been polychrome?
第十一段
1 .I feel strongly when it comes to this.
2 .A marble sculpture that had been colored has another layer of meaning
that was meant to affect the viewer.
3 .As art historians, we must try to interpret the intentions of the artists.
4 .What were the artists trying to achieve?
第十二段
1 .Certain features of the sculpture were highlighted through color, were
made to stand out.
2 .In other words, they caused the viewer to focus on certain features.
3 .And certain colors represented certain things to the ancient artists and
cultures.
4 .A color might symbolize heroism, divinity or youth.
第十三段
1 .One example to consider is the statue of Roman emperor Augustus.
2 .This particular statue of Augustus that I am referring to was discovered
just outside of Rome in 1863 and was in terrific condition.
3 .It's about 2 meters tall, just larger than life size.
4 .It was made from an expensive high quality type of marble and was
obviously carved by an expert.
第十四段
1 .Now, it still had visible traces of color on the hair, eyes and its clothing
and armor.
2 .The paints have been very carefully studied.
3 .And it turns out that the colors weren't just from any pigments.
4 .They were from expensive pigments.
5 .The use of these pigments showed the importance of Augustus and that
he should be honored.
第十五段
1 .And let's consider the extensive traces of a red pigment that were found
on the statue's cloak.
2 .The cloak is a special garment that was traditionally worn by an emperor
on the battlefield.
3 .And in real life it was a red color, which to the Romans, signified the
emperor's authority, military and political authority.
第十六段
1 .Ok, I won't point out any further details about the colors on the Augustus
statue, because you can already begin to see that there was cultural
importance associated with the colors, symbolism, which should help us
understand the status better.
第十七段
1 .There are many, many more sculptures that have traces of pigments left
on them and we have the technology these days to be able to carry out
effective studies of these pigments.
2 .There is a lot of work to be done, but it needs to be done fast.
3 .Like I said before, these pigments deteriorate rapidly so we really need
to do the research before the traces are gone so that we can increase our
understanding of ancient polychrome sculptures and the cultures which
created them.
Lecture2
Listen to part of a lecture in an astronomy class.
第二段
1 .Before we continue talking about the properties of individual galaxies, it's
worth talking about the distribution of galaxies in space.
2 .Efforts at mapping or surveying the universe, making a sort of atlas of
galaxies, have been going on for more than 50 years.
3 .And the creators of the first major map of the universe were the
astronomers Harlow Shapley* 1 and Adelaide Ames2.
第三段
1 .In 1932, Shapley and Ames3 catalogued the positions of 1250 galaxies
by photographing what they saw through their telescopes.
第四段
1 .And they made an important discovery.
2 .Their survey was the first to indicate that galaxies were not distributed
uniformly in space.
3 .Some areas had a lot of galaxies, and other areas had just a few.
Another way of putting this is to say that galaxies are clustered.
4 .They're not spread evenly throughout the universe.
5 .So we have stars grouped together in galaxies and galaxies grouped
together in clusters. Okay?
第五段
1 .Now, after their survey, other astronomers completed surveys that added
to the number of clusters catalogued.
第六段
1 .One of the most important was done by the astronomer George Abell4
2 .Abell completed his survey in 1958.
3 .It added considerably to the map made by Shapley and Ames.
4 .In fact, his map had over 2700 clusters of galaxies.
5 .That is 2700 clusters of galaxies! Not just galaxies.
第七段
1 .But there's another aspect of Abell's work that makes this map so
valuable to astronomers.
2 .He introduced a classification scheme for the galaxy clusters5
3 .Now, surveys completed since Abell's have catalogued additional
galaxies and surveyed more outer space, but no one has improved upon
Abell's classification scheme.
4 .In fact, the Abell catalogue is used as a starting point for astronomers
who study these objects.
第八段
1 .One of the reasons his scheme has been so widely accepted is because
of his sample size.
2 .With all the clusters in his sample, he could determine the different
characteristics of clusters.
3 .And these characteristics form the basis of his classification scheme.
第九段
1 .Now, two of the characteristics crucial to his classification were richness
and symmetry.
2 .So what did he mean by "richness"?
第十段
1 .Well, basically it refers to the number of galaxies there are within a
cluster.
第十一段
1 .Is that the same as density?
第十二段
1 .That's right. Both richness and density refer to the number per area.
2 .Rich clusters, or dense clusters, contain a relatively high number of
galaxies.
第十三段
1 .And symmetry just refers to its shape?
第十四段
1 .Roughly speaking, yes.
2 .Whether the shape of the cluster was the same on the left side as on the
right side.
第十五段
1 .So Abell use categories like that to classify clusters on a scale: from
regular to irregular.
第十六段
1 .A regular cluster is sphere shaped, symmetrical, and most dense in the
middle.
2 .The greatest number of galaxies concentrated in the middle of the
cluster.
第十七段
1 .An irregular cluster might appear to be lopsided, asymmetrical, with a
little concentration of galaxies in the center.
第十八段
1 .You are talking about the shape of the cluster though, not the shape of
the galaxies within the cluster.
第一十九段
1 .Right.
2 .For example, let's consider the Coma Cluster6.
3 .It's a symmetrical cluster basically spherical in shape, but the individual
galaxies within it are elliptical. They're not spherical or spiral shaped, but
the cluster itself shows spherical symmetry.
第二十段
1 .The Virgo Cluster, on the other hand, is considered irregular.
2 .There's no symmetry to its overall shape, no central concentration of
galaxies, but it happens to have both elliptical and spiral galaxies within it.
第二十一段
1 .Another question. You were saying how some clusters have more
galaxies than others.
2 .How many galaxies does a cluster have to have in order to even be a
cluster?
第二十二段
1 .Good question!
第二十三段
1 .Abell's definition of a cluster is this:
第二十四段
1 .First, there have to be more than 50 galaxies within a specific amount of
space.
2 .He said basically that clusters have a radius of roughly 2 megaparsecs.
3 .And it was just an assumption that all clusters would be about the same
size.
4 .It's remarkable that it proved to be correct.
5 .And this standard cluster radius is known today as "The Abell Radius".
第二十五段
1 .And second, those 50 plus galaxies have to be a certain brightness.
2 .Of course it was a rough estimate, but looking at galaxies' brightness
was a good way to distinguish between clusters that were nearby and
those that were more distant.
Conversation2
Listen to a conversation between a student and a university activities
coordinator.
第二段
1 .I understand your problem, but the upper level of the Student Center
isn't available for the time being.
第三段
1 .But my dance group has a performance coming up.
第四段
1 .I've been talking with people all day long who are in the exact same
situation.
2 .There are at least a dozen dance and drama groups on campus, and
they are all scrambling for rehearsal space right now.
第五段
1 .But I made this reservation last June, before leaving for the summer.
2 .No one said anything about construction.
第六段
1 .That's because no one knew that the remodeling was gonna run over
into the beginning of the school year.
2 .The builders are just way behind schedule.
3 .For a while, we weren't even sure that the dining hall on the lower level
would be ready for the start of the semester.
4 .So, it could've been a lot worse.
第七段
1 .So when will...?
第八段
1 .The whole upper level will be ready in six weeks.
2 .The rehearsal rooms, the game room, the computer center.
第九段
1 .Six weeks!
2 .That's not gonna help me.
3 .Our performance is in five weeks.
第十段
1 .Are you part of the program they plan for parents' weekend?
第十一段
1 .Yeah, the thing is we are a tap dancing group, and we need to practice
on hard floors, preferably wood.
2 .We can practice on carpet at first, but it's important for us to be able to
hear our feet hit the floor.
第十二段
1 .Interesting, uh, because of the rhythm, huh?
第十三段
1 .Yeah, because the taping becomes part of the music.
第十四段
1 .So the floors are very important.
第十五段
1 .Exactly, and just about everywhere on campus has carpeting.
第十六段
1 .Well, there's always the stage at the student theatre.
2 .Though it's a long shot, we can look at the schedule.There might be
some odd hours free.
第十七段
1 .What about in town? Do you think the university could help us rent a
rehearsal space in a commercial dance studio in town, given the situation?
第十八段
1 .That's not really my call.
2 .I can reserve rehearsal and performance spaces on campus for you, but
off campus...
第一十九段
1 .So who would I talk to?
2 .The dance department?
第二十段
1 .Look, let's check the theatre schedule first.
Lecture3
Listen to part of the lecture in an environmental science class.
第二段
1 .When you try to imagine a fungus, you'd probably picture a mushroom
popping up out of the ground.
2 .And think that's it.
3 .But a fungus like that...most of it actually lives underground.
第三段
1 .And fungi in general are often an important active component of the soil.
2 .A fungus secrets enzymes into the soil, enzymes that break down,
decompose organic material in the soil.
3 .So the fungus can absorb this material and get nutrition.
第四段
1 .But to me, what's most interesting about this process is how it may
enable fungi to help clean up environmental pollution in the soil.
2 .And that's thanks in part to a substance in their cell walls called Chitin.
第五段
1 .Now a lot of people think fungi are related to plants, but they are not.
Believe it or not, the only other place chitin is found in abundance is in the
exoskeletons of insects, crabs and such.
2 .So in this sense, fungi are more associated with insects than with any
plant. Strange, huh?
第六段
1 .And the chitin in the cell walls of a filamentous fungus...a filament, of
course, is a long thread-like structure, cells joined end to end.
2 .Filamentous fungi grow in soil and in decaying vegetation.
3 .And as their name implies they exist as filaments.
4 .And although regarded as microorganisms, filaments from a single
fungus can fan out to occupy many square meters or even several square
kilometers of forest floor.
5 .Their vast surface area allows them to break down and take in huge
amounts of nutrients, but beyond that, the filaments also pull out of the soil
a great deal of the pollution that might be in there, especially heavy metals.
第七段
1 .And here is where chitin comes in, like some other substances in fungal
cell walls, chitin forms strong chemical bonds to heavy metals in the
environment, in a process we call adsorption.
第八段
1 .Now, don't confuse this with absorption, where a substance is absorbed
into a cell, into the interior of a cell.
2 .I mean, that is happening here too.
3 .But adsorption means binding to the outer surface of the cell.
4 .And a filamentous fungus can adsorb toxic heavy metals, bind them to
the surface of its enormous network of filaments, and thereby detoxify a
large soil ecosystem.
5 .The heavy metals are still there, but instead of leaching into the water
system and contaminating the water underground, large amounts of these
metals may remain bound to the chitin, to the cell walls of filamentous fungi
in the soil, and thus remain chemically inactive for as long as 30 years,
perhaps longer.
第九段
1 .In fact, we can actually use the cell walls of filamentous fungi as a filter,
even after the fungi are dead.
第十段
1 .For example, the pharmaceutical Industry grows filamentous fungi in
large quantities in the lab, like to produce the antibiotic penicillin, the drug
company grows the fungus penicillium, and after the penicillin is extracted,
these dead penicillium filaments, we can use the chitin in their cell walls to
make industrial filters to adsorb heavy metals.
2 .We can put these filters into waste pipes from industrial processes, and
use the filters to trap heavy metals, like mercury and zinc.
3 .Later, we can chemically extract the heavy metals and reuse the filter
over and over.
第十一段
1 .Now going back to the absorption of toxic metals into the body of the
fungus, let's turn our attention to mushrooms.
第十二段
1 .Like other fungi, mushrooms can absorb large quantities of heavy
metals.
2 .In fact, they may contain up to two and a half times the concentration of
toxic metals found in the soil they grow in. So mushrooms, at least what we
see above ground...we can potentially harvest them and then once for all
safely dispose of the pollutants contained within them.
3 .In fact, to clean up, especially the groundwater system, permanently,
harvesting mushrooms is probably the best way to go.
4 .For some reason, this hasn't happened yet as far as I know, but I can
easily envision cultivating mushrooms for the sole purpose of detoxifying a
large underground ecosystem.
Lecture4
Listen to part of a lecture in a marketing class.
第二段
1 .And that wraps up our discussion of how the retail sector, uh, ways in
which retail managers deal with customer complaints.
第三段
1 .So let's shift now to the service sector, which markets not goods but
services, intangibles like transportation, food service, career counseling...
2 .Oh, there are literally hundreds of examples.
第四段
1 .Service providers must, of course, constantly strive to meet customers'
needs.
2 .But as in retail, there are instances of service failure in which the
customer is dissatisfied, uh, perhaps to the point of not doing business with
you anymore.
第五段
1 .Some service failures are beyond an organization's control, like, uh,
computer malfunction that leads to missed deadlines.
2 .Other failures stem from process problems, like inadequate training for
newly-hired employees.
第六段
1 .Then there's human error.
2 .Okay, imagine you manage a car rental agency.
3 .A customer calls in a reservation, but your employee marks down the
wrong date.
4 .So your customer arrives and guess what, the size car he reserved isn't
available.
5 .But your customer is less concerned about the source of the failure than
the solution: what you do about it; what sort of compensation; what service
recovery you give.
第七段
1 .So if you are in the service industry, as a marketer, you always need
some kind of service recovery plan.
2 .Your plan must be in place before a failure occurs and it must also be
communicated promptly to everyone in your organization who deals with
customers so they'll know what to do.
第八段
1 .Service recovery encompasses all the actions taken to get a
disappointed customer back to, uh, well, back to a state of satisfaction.
2 .So if your car rental agency couldn't provide the size car your customer
wanted, but your policy is to provide a roomier car for the same price.
3 .Your customer would probably be happy, might even restore his faith in
your company.
4 .Research has in fact identified service recovery as a significant
determinant of customer loyalty.
第九段
1 .I see what you mean.
2 .Every year£, my family goes on vacation together.
3 .And a few summers ago, when we were in Chicago, it was really really
hot. And guess what, the hotel's air conditioning broke and everyone was
complaining.
4 .What the hotel did...they actually didn't charge anybody for that
weekend.
5 .But the funny thing is that even though we had that horrible experience
at that hotel, because they were so quick to appease us, we usually stay at
that same hotel every time we go to Chicago.
第十段
1 .Great example!
2 .So in this case that hotel chain might consider itself the beneficiary of
the so-called service recovery paradox.
第十一段
1 .Um, the paradox basically implies that customers who experience a
service failure, well, they could potentially be made more loyal than
customers who were satisfied in the first place if an equitable recovery
occurred after the failure.
第十二段
1 .Yes, Ben?
第十三段
1 .Wait a minute.
2 .If a good service recovery creates more loyalty than, um, if things went
smoothly from the get-go1 , why don't companies like make mistakes on
purpose so?
第十四段
1 .So you could implement a recovery plan that leave your customers
delighted as opposed to merely satisfied?
2 .Look, it;s always better to do things right the first time 'cause how how
can you know that the paradox will hold true in every situation?
第十五段
1 .Plus, it's hard to predict if a good service recovery will overcome the
negative effect of a service failure, and what about all those failures that
never come to your attention?
2 .Because statistically about 50 percent of the customers don't complain
about service failures, at least not to the service provider. But negative
word of mouth, now, that got worse implications for your business.
第十六段
1 .Also, you'd have to pay your employees to execute the service a second
time.
2 .Typically, a service recovery is gonna involve some kind of
compensation, right?
3 .So it is gonna cost your company some money that you are going have
to account for in your budget.
第十七段
1 .I've actually been researching some of these issues myself 'cause what
we need is a deeper understanding of customers' thought processes and
their reactions to service recoveries.
2 .How do consumers form expectations?
3 .How do they react to different service recovery tactics?
4 .Can we predict how any given customer will react to a given service
failure?
第十八段
1 .People's expectations, their priorities vary.
2 .Like uh, if I am in a hurry, and the French fries I ordered at a fast food
restauran aren't piping hot2,1 might not complain 'cause I got them fast.
3 .But If I am not in a hurry, I might return the fries even if I had to wait for a
fresh batch.

Conversation1
Listen to a conversation between a student and a computer lab
administrator.
第二段
1 .Excuse me. Do you know that all the printers over in the student center
have stopped working?
第三段
1 .There are eight printers connected to the computers there.
2 .You are saying they are all broken?
第四段
1 .Yes, I just came from there.
2 .There's a lot of frustrated students.
第五段
1 .So many classes have papers due this afternoon that everyone is trying
to print out their stuff at the same time.
第六段
1 .Those printers got overworked and now they all have paper jams or
some other problem.
2 .Can you fix them?
第七段
1 .Well, not really. I'm just an administrator. Most of our actual technicians
are students who take the job on the side.
第八段
1 .Where are they?
第九段
1 .Well, most of the students who work at the computer labs study at the
engineering school, and unfortunately they all took the day off.
2 .I think they have some big exams tomorrow.
第十段
1 .How can there be no technicians working on the biggest deadline day of
the semester?
第十一段
1 .Well, there is one technician working at the computer lab in the arts
building.
2 .Actually, he just sent me an email message saying there was a huge
crowd there, and he could not figure out why.
第十二段
1 .Because people need to print their papers.
2 .There must be something you can do.
3 .People need those printers working.
第十三段
1 .Well, we just ordered new printers and next month we are replacing the
old printers over the student center with a brand new set of printers.
第十四段
1 .But the deadline for submitting papers is just two hours away.
第十五段
1 .I'm afraid there's nothing I can do. Your best bet is to probably head to
the arts building and get in line there.
第十六段
1 .But how did this happen again?
2 .Last semester when the all printers broke down, the president of the
college got involved.
3 .He sent out an email message to all the students saying that he was
going to personally do something to make sure that the situation was
resolved.
第十七段
1 .That's right.
2 .When we had our budget meeting at the beginning of the semester, the
president was there.
3 .That's not something he usually does, but he wanted to make sure we
ordered the new printers.
第十八段
1 .The new printers that are coming next month?
第一十九段
1 .Yeah, I ordered them as soon as the budget was approved.
2 .It's a shame. But the purchasing process being what it is...
第二十段
1 .You know what? It's possible some of the printers are malfunctioning
because they ran out of ink.
2 .Tm not a technician, but if that's what's wrong I could fix it.
3 .I guess I'll grab some ink cartridges and go over to the student center
and check.
4 .No guarantees, sorry, but it might fix the problem.
Lecture1
Listen to part of a lecture in a botany class.
第二段
1 .It's autumn and as you know in most parts of the United States, the
leaves on the trees are changing color from green to yellow, orange and
lots of other colors.
2 .So this will be a great time to talk about how and why some of these
leaves turn one color in particular and that's bright red.
第三段
1 .Well, before we discuss why leaves turn red, first, let's, um, look, I know
this is very old material, but just to play it safe, let's first go over why
leaves are usually green.
第四段
1 .It's chlorophyll, right?
第五段
1 .Leaves get their green color from chlorophyll, the chemical that's
responsible for photosynthesis.
2 .The chlorophyll in the leaves collects energy from the Sun in the form of
sunlight and it converts this energy into sugar which is food for the plant.
3 .It's chlorophyll that makes leaves green most of the time.
第六段
1 .Now, the classic explanation for why leaves change color is this.
第七段
1 .In autumn, the leaves start preparing for the winter and stop synthesizing
new chlorophyll.
2 .Since chlorophyll is sensitive to sunlight and to cold temperatures both
of which you get in autumn.
3 .The existing chlorophyll in the leaves breaks down and since it's not
been replaced by the new chlorophyll.
4 .The green color of the leaves gradually fades away.
5 .As this happens, the other pigments present in the leaf become visible.
According to the classic theory, this is true for the red pigment as well.
6 .It was there in the leaf all along but it was hidden by the green
chlorophyll.
第八段
1 .OK, so that's the classic explanation and it's partially right.
第九段
1 .Why do I say partially?
第十段
1 .Well, it's probably true for pigments like yellow or orange, but it doesn't
seem to hold for the red pigment.
第十一段
1 .Let's back up a bit.
2 .Just what produces this red color in leaves?
3 .It's a red pigment called anthocyanin.
第十二段
1 .Here is where the classic explanation doesn't seem to apply to red.
2 .What's interesting is that during the summer there was very little if any
anthocyanin in the leaves.
3 .But in the weeks before a tree is about to drop its leaves, the production
of anthocyanins increases significantly.
4 .In other words, unlike those other pigments, anthocyanins are not just
unmasked by the breakdown of chlorophyll in autumn.
5 .They are actually created at this time.
第十三段
1 .So that raises a question, why would a tree produce more anthocyanin
just before dropping its leaves?
2 .Why does the tree spend so much of its resources doing this just before
the leaves fall off?
第十四段
1 .On the surface, that doesn't make sense.
2 .It'd be likes spending money to...I don't know...to have your old car
repainted when you know the car's not going to last more than a couple of
months.
3 .All this extra anthocyanin in the autumn seems like a waste.
第十五段
1 .But remember nature is very economical with its resources.
2 .So that means anthocyanin must be serving some function that's
important for the tree.
第十六段
1 .Today, there are some theories about what that function might be.
第十七段
1 .One of them involves predatory insects; another involves fungi.
2 .You know, the more I read about these theories and the related
research, it always created more questions for me than answers.
3 .So I was really glad to learn about a totally different theory, a new one. It
seems to come with research and data that give a full explanation.
4 .So here it is.
第十八段
1 .Remember I said the chlorophyll breaks down?
2 .Well, in autumn, a whole lot of other chemical constituents of the leaf
break down as well.
3 .I don't mean they are totally destroyed 'cause actually they break down
into other different chemicals that the tree can reabsorb from the leaves
and reuse later.
第一十九段
1 .Now, this reabsorption process is very important for the tree and here is
the key.
2 .It's sensitive to light, meaning that too much exposure to sunlight can
interfere with this process.
第二十段
1 .So where does anthocyanin fit in here?
第二十一段
1 .Well, anthocyanin is more stable than chlorophyll.
2 .It's not harmed as easily by the Sun or the cold.
3 .So it's still working long after the chlorophyll breaks down.
第二十二段
1 .But what does it do?
第二十三段
1 .The theory is that anthocyanin protects the reabsorption process from
the sunlight.
2 .For example, if you look closely at a red leaf on a tree, you'll notice that
most of the red pigment is on the upper side of the leaf, the side facing the
sun.
3 .This new theory suggests that what the anthocyanin is doing there on
top is shielding the rest of the leaf from the sunlight, and more importantly,
allowing those important chemicals to be reabsorbed by the tree.
Lecture2
Listen to part of a lecture in a psychology class.
第二段
1 .For some time now, psychologists have been aware of an ability we all
share.
2 .It's the ability to sort of judge or estimate the numbers or relative
quantities of things.
3 .It's called the Approximate Number Sense, or ANS.
第三段
1 .ANS is a very basic, innate ability.
2 .It's what enables you to decide at a glance whether there're more apples
than oranges on a shelf.
3 .And studies have shown that even six-month-old infants are able to use
this sense to some extent.
4 .And if you think about it, you'll realize that it's an ability that some
animals have as well.
第四段
1 .Animals have number...uh...approximate...?
第五段
1 .Approximate Number Sense. Sure.
2 .Just think: would a bird choose to feed in a bush filled with berries or in a
bush with half as many berries?
第六段
1 .Well, the bush filled with berries I guess.
第七段
1 .And the bird certainly doesn't count the berries.
2 .The bird uses ANS: Approximate Number Sense.
第八段
1 .And that ability is innate, it's inborn.
2 .Now I'm not saying that old people have an equal skill or that the skill
can't be improved, but it's present...uh...as I saicL.
3 .It's present in six-month-old babies.
4 .It isn't learned.
第九段
1 .On the other hand, the ability to do symbolic or formal mathematics is
not really what you would call universal.
2 .You need training in the symbols and in the manipulation of those
symbols to work out mathematical problems.
3 .Even something as basic as counting has to be taught.
4 .Formal mathematics is not something that little children can do naturally.
5 .And it wasn't even part of human culture until a few thousand years ago.
第十段
1 .Well, it might be interesting to ask the question:
2 .Are these two abilities linked somehow? Are people who are good at
approximating numbers also proficient in formal mathematics?
第十一段
1 .So to find out, researchers created an experiment designed to test ANS
in 14-year-olds.
2 .They had these teenagers sit in front of a computer screen.
3 .They then flash a series of slides in front of them.
第十二段
1 .Now, these slides had varying numbers of yellow and blue dots on them.
2 .One slide might have more blue dots than yellow dots, let's say...six
yellow dots and nine blue dots.
3 .The next slide might have more yellow dots than blue dots.
4 .The slide would flash just for a fraction of a second.
5 .So you know, there was no time to count the dots.
6 .And then the subjects would press a button to indicate whether they
thought there were more blue dots or yellow dots.
第十三段
1 .So the first thing that jumped out at the researchers when they looked at
the result of the experiment was that between individuals, there were big
differences in ANS proficiency.
2 .Some subjects were consistently able to identify which group of dots was
larger even if there was a small ratio, if the numbers were almost equal,
like ten to nine.
3 .Others had problems even when differences were relatively large, like
twelve to eight.
第十四段
1 .Now, maybe you are asking whether some fourteen-year-olds are just
faster, faster in general, not just in math.
2 .It turns out: tha's not so.
3 .We know this because the fourteen-year-olds had previously been tested
in a few different areas.
第十五段
1 .For example, as eight-year-olds, they had been given a test of rapid
color naming.
2 .That's a test to see how fast they could identify different colors.
3 .But the result didn't show a relationship with the results of the ANS test.
4 .The ones who were great at rapidly naming colors when they were eight
years old weren't necessarily good at the ANS test when they were
fourteen.
5 .And there was no relationship between ANS ability and skills like reading
and word knowledge.
第十六段
1 .But among all the abilities tested over those years, there was one that
correlated with the ANS results: math, symbolic math achievement.
2 .And this answered the researchers' question.
3 .They were able to correlate learned mathematical ability with ANS.
第十七段
1 .But it doesn't really tell us which came first.
第十八段
1 .Go on, Laura.
第一十九段
1 .I mean, if someone's born with good approximate number sense, um,
does that cause them to be good at math?
2 .Or the other way around:
3 .If a person develops math ability, you know, and really studies formal
mathematics, does ANS somehow improve?
第二十段
1 .Those are very good questions, and I don't think they were answered in
these experiments.
第二十一段
1 .But...wait. ANS can improve?
2 .Oh, that's right, you said that before.
3 .Even though it's innate, it can improve.
4 .So wouldn't it be important for teachers in grade schools to...
第二十二段
1 .Teach ANS?
2 .But shouldn't the questions Laura just posed be answered first?
3 .Before we make teaching decisions based on the idea that having a
good approximate number sense helps you learn formal mathematics.
Conversation2
Listen to part of a conversation between a student and his theater
professor.
第二段
1 .Hi. Professor Davis. Sorry I missed the class yesterday. I was just
getting over a cold.
第三段
1 .That's alright, Andrew. Feeling better now?
第四段
1 .Oh, yeah, fine. Um, I had a question though.
2 .For the mid-term, how much do we need to know like about the different
acting styles?
3 .Since the last few chapters have been on writing our own material,
scripts and stuff...well...will the exam be about that? Or about stuff in the
earlier chapters? Like."um."
第五段
1 .Oh, Andrew. Before I forget, I will get to your question, but, now, don't
leave without taking the tickets for tomorrow's field trip.
2 .I have a last-minute meeting so I can't make it after all. But since you
helped organize the trip, I'll let you hand out the tickets. I've got everything
you need right here.
第六段
1 .Sure, no problem.
第七段
1 .And you don't need directions to the theater. You've been there before,
right?
第八段
1 .Yup.
第九段
1 .Good. Oh, oh, also, please remind everyone about the reception
afterward.
2 .It'll be an opportunity to ask Alan Altman about his acting in the play,
which we can discuss in class next week.
第十段
1 .Ok, HI tell them. It's really something! I mean, I know our acting
professors must in plays all the time, but it isn't every day you get to see
one right here in town.
第十一段
1 .Oh, you might be surprised.
2 .There's a calendar on the main bulletin board listing all the local
productions that faculty are involved in.
第十二段
1 .Well, it seems like Professor Altman is a really popular actor. I just read
his bio in the local paper.
2 .I know the critics always praise him, but I had no idea he was such a
commercial success, too.
3 .And it said he just won an award last year for...uh...playwriting, wasn't it?
第十三段
1 .Well, there is a general playwriting category, but actually, his award was
for script adaptation.
2 .He adapted a novel into a play.
第十四段
1 .Script adaptation?
第十五段
1 .Oh, it's a very specialized skill.
2 .Writing a play based on some other written work, novels, short stories.
3 .Now we've been studying original plays, which are pretty much based on
the writer's imagination.
4 .But think about adapting a script...
第十六段
1 .Yeah, seems like it might be easier, like to start with something that's
already written.
第十七段
1 .Well, actually think about it, transferring that material to a whole different
genre, from narration to live dialogue.
2 .Imagination is a part of it, sure, but it also requires a lot of technical
knowledge of about theater production, acting and so on.
3 .So Professor Altman, for example, he took a novel and made it into a
play, dealing with all the different conventions that plays have.
4 .You know, like limitations of scene changes and...uh...well, it'd be a
good thing to ask him about it at the reception tomorrow.
第十八段
1 .Yeah, sounds like an interesting topic.
第一十九段
1 .Oh, and before I forget, the packet with the tickets has a list of the
students' addresses.
2 .Since Ivan is picking you up first, you can direct the driver to the other
students' dorms.
第二十段
1 .Sure. That was the plan.
第二十一段
1 .Okay, good. Now, about the mid-term.
Lecture3
Listen to part of the lecture in a children's literature class.
第二段
1 .Today we'll start looking at the most important children's book authors of
the twentieth century.
2 .And I'd like to start with an author illustrator whom some of you probably
grew up reading:Dr. Seuss.
第三段
1 .His actual name was Theodor Seuss Geisel.
2 .Geisel's work was hugely popular among beginning readers and their
parents, but it wasn't always considered literature or subjected to serious
academic inquiry until relatively recently.
3 .In fact, not only weren't his books considered literature, but they weren't
always considered good school books.
第四段
1 .In the late 1950s and even through the 60s, US teachers resisted
Seuss's books because they perceived them as having a comic book
style...fine, maybe, but not...not appropriate for the classroom.
第五段
1 .None of Geisel's books individually won him a Pulitzer Prize.
2 .And he didn't receive any top children's literary awards either.
3 .Although the Pulitzer Prize committee did give him a citation in 1984 for
his...uh..."special contribution over nearly half a century to the education
and enjoyment of America's children and their parents."
4 .But again, that wasn't until 1984.
第六段
1 .Perhaps one reason his books weren't taken seriously is that even
though they often rhyme, you wouldn't call him a great poet.
2 .Geisel's rhyme schemes are very simple.
3 .And often, to make things rhyme, he used silly names for his imaginary
creatures, like the Grinch and Sneetches.
4 .In fact, one book features 34 pairs of rhymed words, but only eight of
those pairs consist entirely of real words.
5 .The rest are made-up words.
第七段
1 .Geisel also illustrated his own books and created a lot of highly
memorable characters from a visual standpoint.
2 .Yet as far as his artistic talent, no one's ever called him a great artist or
a great illustrator.
第八段
1 .For his human characters, he pretty much drew the same face over and
over.
2 .Except for minor accessories, all the people in his books look the same.
3 .Not exactly something you'd be encouraged to do in art school. And the
way he drew even nonhuman characters was dismissed by many critics as
being overly simplistic.
4 .His landscapes, on the other hand, they are simple but they are also
extremely clever.
5 .He had this uncanny knack for creating the illusion of great distance with
some very simple shapes and lines.
第九段
1 .But what about from a pedagogical standpoint?
第十段
1 .Well, let's consider Geisel's most famous book: The Cat in the Hat.
2 .Now, in a way, this book, The Cat in the Hat, captures the essence of
Geisel's particular genius as a children's author.
3 .Geisel actually wrote it in response to an article written in 1954 by an
acclaimed novelist named John Hersey.
4 .In this article, Hersey criticized the textbooks being used in elementary
schools to teach children to read.
5 .He called the books 'boring, contrived, and utterly humorless'.
第十一段
1 .After seeing Hersey's article, Geisel must have wondered what made the
books so dull.
2 .And one thing he found was they use only words from the Dolch List.
3 .The Dolch List contained a few hundred common sight words, words
like, well, cat and hat.
4 .At the time, the Dolch List was widely adhered to by publishers of
textbooks for beginning readers.
第十二段
1 .Well, using only words from the Dolch List, Geisel tapped into his fertile
imagination.
2 .And the result was an incredibly funny and engaging storyline about a
talking cat that convinces a brother and sister to let him make a huge mess
in their house while their mother is away.
3 .Another character, a talking fish, tries to warn the children that they'll be
blamed for the cat's crazy antics.
4 .You can really feel the tension building up in those kids as the cat makes
the house messier and messier.
5 .Ultimately the house gets straightened up in the nick of time.
6 .And the kids are left speechless when their mom shows up and casually
asks if anything interesting happened in her absence.
7 .The kids, and presumably, Geisel's readers are left thinking: Should they
tell the truth? And that's where the book ends.
第十三段
1 .Brilliant! There aren't too many authors who can set up a moral dilemma
like this and then get children to think about it for themselves.
Lecture4
Listen to part of a lecture in a physics class.
2 .The professor has been discussing electromagnetic waves.
第二段
1 .So are there any questions before we continue our discussion of
different types of electromagnetic waves?
2 .Um, today, we'll focus on radio waves, and specifically, very low
frequency radio waves. Yes, Tim.
第三段
1 .Are you going to talk at all about the difference between radio waves and
sound waves?
第四段
1 .Uh, Ok. That might be a good place to start actually.
2 .Sound waves are mechanical in nature, right? They can only originate
and spread in places where there's some dense physical medium, like
atmosphere or water.
3 .They result from changes in pressure in that medium, like changes in air
pressure.
4 .So they can't travel through a vacuum, where there is no dense physical
medium, which is why they can't travel through interplanetary space.
第五段
1 .Radio waves, on the other hand, are fundamentally different from sound
waves.
2 .They are electromagnetic.
3 .They result from oscillations of the electromagnetic field and don't need
a physical medium, so they, like other types of electromagnetic wave, can
travel basically anywhere, through a vacuum, or through atmosphere or
water.
第六段
1 .Now, radio waves can be detected.
2 .For example, very low frequency radio waves can be detected with a
special type of radio receiver called a very low frequency radio or VLF
radio, which can pick up radio waves with very low frequencies, from 3 to
30 kilohertz, which aren't really picked up by a regular household or car
radio.
3 .So VLF radios pick up VLF radio waves and convert them to sounds we
can hear.
第七段
1 .Um, on Earth the main source of naturally occurring VLF emissions is
lightning, which generates a pulse of radio waves every time it flashes.
2 .Yes, Laura.
第八段
1 .Since you almost always get lightning with thunderstorms. We can pick
up VLF waves pretty often, right?
2 .You just have to wait until there is a thunderstorm.
第九段
1 .Ah, do you? Have to wait? VLF receivers are very sensitive and VLF
waves travel very far.
2 .So we can pick up emissions from lightning that's far away. So actually,
you can pretty much listen to them all the time because lightning strikes
Earth constantly, about a hundred times per second.
3 .Even if there is no lightning where you are, with a VLF radio, you can
hear the crackling from storms that are thousands of kilometers away.
第十段
1 .However, some times of day are better than others for picking up VLF
waves.
2 .Daytime isn't as good as night time, for example.
3 .And what's more, my colleague Denis Gallagher says, and in my opinion,
he's right.
4 .He says the best time to listen for them is around sunset or sunrise.
5 .That's when there're natural waveguides in the local atmosphere.
第十一段
1 .Did you say waveguide?
第十二段
1 .Yes, a waveguide.
2 .Usually it refers to a device, like a metal conductor that's used to guide
and direct waves.
3 .But waveguides also occur naturally.
4 .They make a path for radio waves to follow in our atmosphere.
5 .These natural waveguides occur when the Sun is rising or setting, which
makes sunrise and sunset good times to pick up VLF emissions.
第十三段
1 .Now, there are a few different sounds that you can hear on a VLF
receiver, because when lightning strikes the radio waves travel different
distances and in different ways before they reach the receiver.
第十四段
1 .Some really interesting ones are called whistlers. Whistlers come from
lightning-generated radio waves that leave earth's atmosphere and travel
into earth's magnetosphere before bouncing back down.
2 .Not all radio waves do this and the sound they make, well, we call them
whistlers because they sound like slowly descending tones.
3 .And no two whistlers are alike.
4 .To me, they're the most intriguing.
第十五段
1 .Another interesting sound is the tweek.
2 .Tweeks are the result of VLF waves that have travelled a long distance
through the waveguides.
3 .They produce a chirpy sound because the higher frequency parts of the
wave reach the radio receiver before the lower frequency parts.
4 .The entire wave is still considered very low frequency.
5 .It's just that some parts of the wave have lower frequencies than others,
OK?
TPO44
Conversation1
Listen to a conversation between a student and her sociology professor.
第二段
1 .I'm glad you got my message and were able to make it.
2 .Where are the other members of your group? Tom and Jane?
第三段
1 .They are actually at the library.
2 .They have a biology lab assignment that's due later this afternoon. So
I'm here to represent the whole group.
第四段
1 .But...um...when we got your e-mail message about being worried about
our research project, we were a little confused, we thought you were
excited about our idea for the project.
第五段
1 .Well, I think it's a great research topic, but when I looked closely at your
plan for accomplishing the research, I realized that your group was
probably asking for some trouble.
第六段
1 .What do you mean? I thought that, you know, by monitoring students
studying in the library we could really get a good understanding of people's
study habits and stuff.
第七段
1 .The thing is, I think you might have a problem because of the Hawthorne
Effect.
第八段
1 .The Hawthorne Effect?
第九段
1 .The Hawthorne effect is a technical term for when
researchers...uh...more or less forget about a specific variable, the variable
of the researchers themselves.
第十段
1 .Now, the students in the library, they are going to know that you are
observing them, right? So you have to consider the effect your very
presence will have on the people you are observing.
第十一段
1 .But...so you think... I mean it's not like our observations would be a
secret. The students would know exactly what we would be doing.
2 .I mean, we'd put up a sign right outside the library.
第十二段
1 .Yes, but that's just it.
2 .When people know they are being watched, they act differently.
3 .Let me explain how the Hawthorne effect got its name and...well...you,ll
get the idea.
第十三段
1 .See, there was a manufacturing facility called the Hawthorne plant.
2 .And researchers conducted some experiments there to see what
conditions make workers the most productive.
第十四段
1 .What sort of conditions?
第十五段
1 .Well, one thing they experimented with was the lights. Were workers
more productive with bright lights or dim lights? Well, here is the thing,
whatever the researchers did, the workers' productivity increased.
2 .When the lighting was improved , productivity went up.
3 .When the lighting was dimmed , productivity went up again.
第十六段
1 .That doesn't make a lot of sense.
第十七段
1 .Exactly! So initially the experiment was considered a failure.
2 .But then the researchers realized that their own presence had affected
the workers' productivity.
3 .The workers knew that the researchers were watching them , and with
so much attention on them the workers felt compelled to work harder.
第十八段
1 .Oh, I guess that really could bean issue with my group's research.
第一十九段
1 .Yes, but I don't want to send you all back to square one.
2 .So how about you set up a meeting with your group members and
discuss this. Then we can meet again and go over your ideas.
3 .And I think that we should be able to figure out a way to get a round the
problem.
Lecture1
Listen to part of a lecture in a materials science class.
第二段
1 .Ok. Last time we finished going over some of the fundamental concepts
of nanotechnology, the multi-disciplinary science of manipulating or
controlling extremely small units of matter on the scale of molecules or
even atoms.
第三段
1 .So, I want to talk about how nanotechnology is being used today.
2 .And just to give you an idea, we'll look at one particular application.
第四段
1 .A team of material scientists in Massachusetts has been working on a
new ultra-thin coating, a nano coating that might be applied to objects like
bathroom mirrors, car windows, and eye glasses to prevent fogging.
2 .And the coating has the potential to be a permanent solution, unlike the
kinds of anti-fogging spray-on liquids that are on the market today.
第五段
1 .Now, fogging often occurs when a cold surface comes into contact with
warm moist air, such as when a glass shower door or mirror fogs up during
a warm shower.
第六段
1 .Now, what's actually happening is, what the fog is, is thousands of tiny
spherical water droplets condensing on the surface of the glass.
2 .Light hits the water droplets and is scattered in random directions,
causing the fogging effect.
第七段
1 .Now, the kind of spray-on treatments I mentioned.
2 .Well, they wear off.
3 .What happens is they cause the tiny water droplets to flatten when they
condense on the surface of the shower door or bathroom mirror or
whatever object it is, it's been applied to.
第八段
1 .Because the droplets are flattened, when light hits them, the light doesn't
scatter.
2 .But, as I said, those kinds of treatments don't last very long.
第九段
1 .The new coating has two important components.
2 .One, negatively charged silicon nano particles, these are basically tiny
particles of glass.
3 .And two, a positively charged polymer, which you already know, a
polymer is a chemical compound.
4 .They're layered over each other.
5 .The polymer, then the silicon nano particles, the polymer, then the
silicon nano particles, you see.
6 .They're layered in such a way that the silicon nano particles don't pack
together tightly.
7 .In other words, the structure has pores, or holes, little tiny pockets
throughout it.
第十段
1 .The coating prevents fog from developing, because it loves water.
2 .It attracts the water droplets, sucking them into the tiny pores.
3 .And that alters the shape of the droplets.
4 .The droplets are forced to flatten and to join together into a single sheet
of water, rather than remaining as single droplets, each of which is a
sphere that scatters light in different directions.
第十一段
1 .Ok, so, instead of being scattered, the light passes through the thin
sheet of water.
2 .So, there's no fogging effect.
第十二段
1 .The ultra-thin coating can be made more durable by heating it, and of
course the object it's applied to, to an extremely hot temperature, 500
degree Celsius.
2 .What that does, is burn the polymer away, and fuse the silicon nano
particles together, while maintaining the structure of pores.
第十三段
1 .But that's possible only on materials that can withstand high heat.
2 .Glass? Yes. Plastics? No.
3 .But they're working on solving that problem, trying to come up with a way
to coat plastics and other materials, durably and effectively.
第十四段
1 .Interestingly, it was a plant, the lotus plant that inspired this work.
2 .I guess you could say inspired it in an indirect sort of way.
3 .The leaves of this plant are what we call superhydrophobic.
4 .Lotus leaves, being superhydrophobic, don't attract water.
5 .They repel it, in a big way.
6 .When raindrops fall on lotus leaves, they remain spherical. They roll
right off.
第十五段
1 .So for a long time, the Massachusetts scientists tried to create a coating
that acted like these lotus leaves, a coating that was superhydrophobic.
2 .But then they began to think about the opposite extreme.
3 .Could they accomplish their goal by making a coating that, instead of
repelling water, actually, attracted water?
第十六段
1 .Well, they seem to have gotten quite far with this approach.
2 .It's really strong work, with a range of interesting consumer applications.
3 .It's not costly to manufacture the coating.
4 .Some carmakersare interested in applying it to their wind shields.
5 .Looks like we'll probably see it on the markets in everyday products in
the next few years.
Lecture2
Listen to part of a lecture in an introduction to drama class.
第二段
1 .Now, throughout the history of drama, there has been a, well, a
relationship between the structure of a play, and the structure of the space
where the play was performed.
2 .And this goes all the way back to the ancient Greeks.
第三段
1 .The Greeks built the first theaters in the fifth century B.C.E.
2 .These were outdoor theaters.
3 .The architects looked for sites where you had a natural bowl-like
formation on the side of a hill, and that's where they set the theater.
4 .All Greek theaters were pretty much the same.
5 .There was some natural variation to accommodate the size and shape of
the site, but as far as the basic elements went, those remained constant.
第四段
1 .Have a look at this diagram.
2 .Let's start with the area where the actors performed, like, what we call
the stage today.
3 .The Greeks referred to this space as the skene.
4 .Uh, there's some confusion about the use of the word 'skene' by different
scholars.
5 .Some authors use it to refer only to the structure behind the stage, while
others use it to refer to the structure and the stage together, and that's how
I'll use the term, to refer to both the stage and the building.
第五段
1 .Um, so, anyway, the skene started as a simple wooden platform, but
eventually became much more elaborate.
2 .The front wall of the building was decorated like a palace, or a temple,
and served as background scenery for the play.
3 .The building was also a storage place for costumes, props, things like
that.
第六段
1 .Yes, Robert?
第七段
1 .So, did they decorate the skene for each play or, um, change the
scenery during the play, like we do today?
2 .Or, did the whole story take place in one setting?
第八段
1 .Well, everything the audience saw happened in that one setting usually
in front of either a temple or a palace, but the audience didn't witness all
events in the story.
2 .Some events couldn't be presented convincingly, so the playwrights had
them take place somewhere off stage, where the audience couldn't see
them.
3 .And then news of the event would be reported by one of the characters.
Diane?
第九段
1 .Last summer, I saw... Hippolytus.
第十段
1 .Excellent! I hope you enjoyed it.
第十一段
1 .Definitely. So, at one point, you see Hippolytus being sent off by his
father, then a little later, a messenger arrives and describes how
Hippolytus was riding in his chariot when a giant bull appeared out of the
ocean, and caused the chariot to crash, and then, after we hear what
happened to Hippolytus, he's carried back on stage where he dies.
第十二段
1 .Exactly. I mean, can you imagine trying to show all that action, a giant
animal rising out of the sea?
第十三段
1 .Um; Okay. The next area was the space the ancient Greeks called the
Orchestra.
2 .The orchestra was either round, as you see here, or a semi-circle.
3 .Um; in ancient Greek, the word orchestra actually meant the dancing
place, because this is where the chorus danced and sang.
第十四段
1 .But to understand Greek plays, you need to understand an additional
function of the chorus.
2 .Yes, the ancient Greek chorus did most definitely sing and dance like
choruses do today, but the chorus's most important role was commenting
on what the characters on stage were doing and thinking.
3 .In fact, Aristotle, the Greek philosopher, thought the chorus should be
considered as acting out a role in the play.
第十五段
1 .Yeah, I read that a chorus could have a distinct personality, just like a
person.
第十六段
1 .Absolutely. In fact, you'll see an excellent example of that in the first play
we'll be studying.
第十七段
1 .Okay, the last space was the seating area for the audience.
2 .This was called the theatron.
3 .In ancient Greek, theatron means seeing, that's S-E-E-l-N-G, seeing
place.The theatron was shaped in a semi-circle with rows of seating rising
up the sides of the bowl.
4 .It was designed to take advantage of the natural acoustic benefits of the
setting.
5 .The shape of the bowl captured sound and funneled it upwards so that
even in the top rows, spectators were able to hear the performers very
clearly.
第十八段
1 .Actually, that the name theatron means seeing place is kind of ironic.
2 .Some theaters had fifty or more rows of seats accommodating up to
14,000 spectators, ascending way up the hillside, and this was long before
theater binoculars were invented.
Conversation2
Listen to a conversation between a student and an art professor.
第二段
1 .Hi. Dr. Morten. I'm Karen Stern. I met you briefly about a year ago when
I was applying to the university.
2 .You were on a panel of professors and you were talking about the art
department.
第三段
1 .Ah...and you are now a student here.
2 .I guess I said the right thing.
第四段
1 .Yeah. Right now I am doing the intro-courses in the art department, but I
am really interested in painting.
第五段
1 .Well, I did several of the painting courses so I hope to see you in the
future.
第六段
1 .Actually I was wondering: you are in charge of student art exhibitions at
the university gallery, right?
第七段
1 .Right!
第八段
1 .So I know all the exhibitors are students, but I was wondering how you
choose the works you exhibit every month. Is there like a submission
process or something?
2 .Now, there is a submission process, yes.
3 .We a have gallery review committee, but we already have our exhibitions
planned for the rest of the schoolyear.
4 .Generally our exhibitors are third- and fourth-year students, well into
their coursework.
第九段
1 .Oh; Well, I guess that will be something to look forward to then.
2 .Tell me, do you show all kinds of paintings?
第十段
1 .Well, actually we started doing something different with the gallery this
year.
2 .We are featuring a specific technique each month.
3 .Next month's exhibition, for instance, will feature drip paintings.
第十一段
1 .Really? Like Jackson Pollock?
第十二段
1 .Ah....so you are familiar with Pollock's work.
第十三段
1 .Well, sort of, though I've only seen photographs of it.
2 .I know he dripped paint onto the canvas instead of using a brush.
3 .I read he stretched out his canvases on the floor of a studio and then he
climbed up on a ladder to pour paint, ordinary house paint, from a can onto
the canvas.
第十四段
1 .That's right. That was characteristic of Pollock in the late forties, in what
we call his drip period.
2 .And the object was to produce a constant stream of paint to create
continuous lines, because as you know when you use a brush directly on a
canvas you get broken lines.
3 .So, you like Pollock.
第十五段
1 .Yeah, I do. I like abstract works in general.
2 .There's a class on abstract art, right?
第十六段
1 .Actually I teach that class and drip painting was one of our themes last
year.
2 .Some students from last year's class have continued experimenting with
it and created some incredible pieces using everything from squeezed
bottles to computer controlled sprayers.
第十七段
1 .Do they look a lot like Pollock's work?
第十八段
1 .Well, our goal wasn't to imitate Jackson Pollock.
2 .The object was to get students to look at different ways of applying paint
to a canvas.
3 .But you don't have to enroll in a specific course to be invited to exhibit
your work.
4 .It just has to fit the theme for one of our exhibitions.
Lecture3
Listen to part of a lecture in an anthropology class.
第二段
1 .So, we've been talking about early civilizations, how they developed, and
early agriculture.
2 .And it's believed that agriculture arose independently in a few areas of
the world about ten thousand years ago, and then spread from those areas
to the rest of the world.
3 .Those cradles of agriculture include the Middle East, China and
Southeast Asia, and parts of the Americas.
第三段
1 .Now, for many years archaeologists have speculated that agriculture
also arose independently in another center, too-New Guinea, which is just
north of Australia, in the South Pacific Ocean.
2 .You can see it on this map.
第四段
1 .So, it had been assumed for a long time that New Guinea,
2 .that domesticated plants and animals,
3 .the practice of agriculture, generally,
4 .had been introduced from Southeast Asia about 3500 years ago,
5 .had come south essentially.
第五段
1 .Then in the 1960s and 70s, research was conducted at sites in New
Guinea to explore the possibility of independent agricultural development.
第六段
1 .But unfortunately, the evidence gathered at that time was inconclusive.
第七段
1 .For instance, although evidence was found of deforestation,
2 .you know, cutting down trees, from at least 7,000 years ago,
3 .that is long before we;d thought previously.
4 .It was unclear whether the forest had been cleared by farmers to plant
fields,
5 .or by hunter-gatherers, so they could hunt more easily.
6 .And many plant remains like seeds and fruits don't preserve well in
swampy soils, in humid environments like you often find in New Guinea.
7 .So really, the proof was limited.
第八段
1 .But, recent research has turned up some pretty convincing support.
2 .A group of archaeologists returned to a site that had been previously
examined,
3 .Kuk Swamp, which is in a mountain valley in the highlands of what is
now Papua, New Guinea.
第九段
1 .Based on their findings, they identified a succession of phases of
agricultural development in the wetlands there,
2 .with several of these phases predating the earliest known agricultural
influence from Southeast Asia.
第十段
1 .At the site in Kuk, they used an array of modern archaeological methods
to analyze sediment samples from the soil.
2 .From the oldest soil layer dating back 10,000 years, they found evidence
of pits, stake holes and ditches.
3 .Now, these all indicate that crops were being planted.
4 .Plants are tied to stakes, and ditches are for... for drainage,
5 .a proof of a very early, first phase of agricultural development.
第十一段
1 .The second phase, which they identify from a higher layer of soil,
featured regularly distributed mounds.
2 .Mounds were constructed to plant crops that can't tolerate very wet soil,
3 .such as bananas, because remember Kuk is a swampy wetland, and
bananas wouldn't ordinarily grow well there.
第十二段
1 .And in the layers from Kuk's third phase, they found evidence of an
extensive network of ditches and drainage channels,
2 .indicating a further refinement of wetland cultivation.
3 .Because they had more advanced techniques than were available to
earlier researchers,
4 .the archaeologists also were able to identify actual plant remains -
micro-fossils in the soil from banana plants,
5 .and...and also grains of starch from taro, on the edges of stone tools that
date from about 10,000 years ago.
第十三段
1 .Finding the taro remains were very important,
2 .because it meant that it must have been planted there, brought from the
lowlands,
3 .because taro doesn't grow naturally in the highlands.
第十四段
1 .And as for the bananas, researchers also found a high percentage of
fossils from banana plants in sediment samples dating from about 7,000
years ago,
2 .proof the bananas were deliberately planted,
3 .because where bananas grow naturally the concentration of the plant
fossils is lower.
4 .Bananas don't naturally grow so densely.
5 .As a matter of fact, recent genetic research,
6 .genetic comparisons of banana species,
7 .suggests that the type of banana grown in New Guinea was
domesticated there and then brought to Southeast Asia.
第十五段
1 .So, not sure where I'm going with this?
第十六段
1 .Well, usually, we expect to see that certain social changes are brought
about by the development of agriculture,
2 .structural changes in the society like rapid population growth, social
classes.
3 .But New Guinea, it's largely unchanged.
4 .It's remained an egalitarian and rural society, so what does that tell us
about the usual assumption?
Lecture4
Listen to part of a lecture in an environmental science class.
第二段
1 .Now, there is growing interest these days in generating electricity from
renewable energy sources, right? From developing wind farms to tapping
into an underground source of geothermal energy.
2 .And when you're considering a new project, it's important to look at the
costs as well as benefits of developing that energy source.
3 .Let me give you an example of the kind of thing I am talking about.
第三段
1 .There is currently a lot of interest in harnessing the power of the oceans,
2 .of the ocean tides, that is,
3 .the movement of huge amounts of water which causes the water level of
oceans to rise and fall.
4 .The idea is that if we can harness that tidal energy,
5 .it'd be a great clean enewable energy source.
第四段
1 .One place where this tidal energy can be harnessed is at a shallow body
of water, such as an estuary.
第五段
1 .Now, can anyone tell us what an estuary is? Yes, Ted.
第六段
1 .An estuary is where a river enters the ocean.
2 .The fresh water meets the ocean water.
3 .Sometimes it is covered in water. Sometimes it is not.
第七段
1 .Some parts of the estuary, as the tides go in and out, but other parts are
always submerged.
第八段
1 .Now, estuaries are an ideal place to try to capture energy from changes
in tides because,
2 .well, there is an exceptionally large difference between the water level at
high tide and at low tide.
3 .All that movement of water generates a lot of energy.
4 .And one way to harness that energy is by building a structure called a
barrage there.
第九段
1 .A barrage is basically a large low dam that's built across an estuary.
2 .When the tides go in and out, the moving water flows through tunnels in
the barrage.
3 .So you have huge amounts of water trying to flow through these
relatively small tunnels and that turns turbines that generate electricity.
第十段
1 .Now, these estuaries are important because of their high level of
biological productivity.
2 .They are home to lots of birds, fish and other marine life.
3 .So when you propose to construct a barrage, you have lots of issues to
consider.
第十一段
1 .For example, it would change the existing water levels in the estuary.
2 .Since a lot of water is getting held up by the barrage, the incoming tides
won¡¯t go as high,
3 .but they wouldn't be as low during low tide, either.
4 .This might help prevent flooding. But it would also affect the mudflats,
those areas of mud that normally are exposed when the tide recedes.
第十二段
1 .But don't lots of birds rely on exposed mudflats for food?
第十三段
1 .I mean, don't they eat tiny animals that live in the mud?
2 .And what about those tiny animals?
3 .What would happen to them if the mudflats were endangered?
第十四段
1 .So you are seeing some of the potential problems with the barrage.
2 .But consider this, right now, the water in an estuary is very cloudy.
3 .The tidal currents are constantly churning up the sediments that rivers
deposit in the estuary.
4 .But a barrage would reduce the tidal currents. So a lot of that sediment
would settle to the floor of the estuary.
5 .It wouldn't get stirred up so much.
6 .The water would be clearer,
7 .allowing more sunlight to reach deeper into the water,
8 .which might lead to more food for birds and other animals,
9 .attracting new wildlife to the area.
10 .So it;s a complicated environmental picture.
第十五段
1 .Have they tried this anywhere? Built a barrage?
第十六段
1 .Yes, there are several in operation. There is one in France.
第十七段
1 .Now, they have to be careful there about how they turn on the turbines
because they create currents and waves that can affect boats.
第十八段
1 .But I haven't read about any major ecological problems.
2 .In fact, the fishing is supposed to have improved.
3 .Plus there is even more bird life.
第一十九段
1 .But some of the barrages we're considering now would be much larger
than that one.
2 .There has been one proposed for the estuary of Great Britain's Severn
River, one of the largest estuaries in the world.
3 .It would be 16 kilometers long.
4 .Just to give you an idea, the barrage in France is less than a kilometer.
第二十段
1 .Outside of environmental concerns, such a project would be hugely
expensive and that's another argument against barrages,
2 .well, such large ones anyway.
3 .Critics say that it would better to use that money for something else,
4 .such as improving the energy efficiency of buildings.
5 .You could make a lot of buildings more efficient with all that money and
that would reduce the need for electricity.
TPO45
Conversation1
Sorry you had to wait. It's a busy time of year.
2 .Lots of people mailing packages home.
第二段
1 .I bet. I'll have to come next week to do that.Im moving out of my dorm
and Tm sending some papers home.
第三段
1 .Ok. Well be here. What can I do for you today?
第四段
1 .Well, my roommate asked me to pick something up for her. I told her I
was coming down here. She got this notice saying that there's a package
to pick up. I guess it was too big to fit into our mailbox.
第五段
1 .I am sorry. But I can only give packages to the person who they're
addressed to. It's university policy.
第六段
1 .Really? Could you make an exception? She is my roommate.
第七段
1 .I wish I could, but she'll have to come and get it herself.
2 .And be sure to tell her to have her student ID card on her.
3 .We will need to see identification.
4 .Oh, and she'll need that package notification too.
第八段
1 .Ok. HI let her know. Also since I'm moving, I'll be able to receive my mail
at my new apartment, so I don't really need my campus mailbox.
第九段
1 .Oh, Ok. Although I should tell you that we do recommend that students
use the campus mailbox service even if they are moving off campus.
第十段
1 .Really? Why?
第十一段
1 .Well, if any of your professors want to notify you of changes to class
schedules or get in touch with you for any reason...
第十二段
1 .My professors have my email address.
第十三段
1 .Yes, that's true. But remember things like university newsletters, flyers
from university clubs, notices about special events, they're only distributed
to campus mailboxes.
2 .None of that is mailed off campus.
第十四段
1 .Well, I worked at the college newspaper£, so I should be able to keep on
top of what's going on.
2 .Plus there's a bulletin board outside the dining hall.
第十五段
1 .True. But you know if it's the campus mailbox fee, I might be able to offer
you a less expensive rate for next year.
2 .We can do that in special circumstances.
第十六段
1 .Thanks.But I mean I can afford the mailbox fee. It's just that between my
off-campus address, my email account and the school newspaper, I don't
think there will be a problem.
第十七段
1 .Ok. In that case, stop by the main desk on your way out of the building
and pick up the form you'll need.
2 .And don't forget to include a forwarding mail address for anything that's
addressed to your box from outside the university.
Lecture1
Listen to part of a lecture in an Art History class.
第二段
1 .As I was saying, the Renaissance period, which started in the 1400s in
Europe, the Renaissance was still a pretty religious period, and that's
reflected in the artwork of that time.
第三段
1 .But artists were starting to experiment with a more secular point of view
as well, a tendency to also use the natural world as the subject matter for
their art.
第四段
1 .And there were different ways that these natural themes were explored.
2 .For instance, many artists would paint portraits, while others, although
this was more common in Northern Europe, would make landscapes the
subject of their works.
第五段
1 .But today i like to consider an influential Italian Renaissance artist, Leon
Battista Alberti, who took a slightly different approach.
第六段
1 .Leon Battista Alberti was a painter, sculptor, architect, musician, poet,
very wide-ranging interests, like Da Vinci or Michelangelo, the sort of guy
for whom the term "Renaissance Man was in fact created.
第七段
1 .created.Alberti believed that the most important approach for a painter
was to capture a story or narrative.
2 .Now, as Tve indicated, this narrative could be the religious or secular,
depending on what the work of art was for.
3 .If the work was to be placed in a church, then obviously, it'd have a
religious theme, whereas, if it was for someone's home, then it could deal
with a different subject matter.
4 .The exact narrative didn't really matter, so long as it was one that
captivated the audience, that held the viewers' attention.
第八段
1 .So, what is actually needed to tell a story?
第九段
1 .Well, Alberti needed characters, right?
2 .Human figures. And he wanted to represent them as realistically as
possible, to capture the viewers' attention.
3 .One way he achieved this was to make use of what's known as "the
contrapposto pose".
第十段
1 .A contrapposto pose basically entails showing a slight twist in the body.
2 .The shoulders and hips are usually bent in different directions.
3 .In other words, if the left shoulder is bent, so that it's slightly higher than
the right shoulder, then the hips will be bent, so that the left side will be
slightly lower than the right side.
4 .Similarly, in sculptures, most of the weight seems to be on one foot,
which also results in this slanted position, making it seem like the figure is
about to walk or move. This adds to the realistic aspect of the figure.
第十一段
1 .But there are actually a lot of things that could go wrong in the attempt to
create such a pose.
2 .You could make a figure's arms bigger than its legs, or the head too
small for the body.
3 .Messing up the proportions can leave a figure looking cartoon-like and
unnatural.
4 .But Alberti had a solution.
5 .He encouraged artists to visualize a figures' bones and structure.
6 .This would give the artist an idea of the proportions of the figure.
7 .From there, Alberti suggested that the artists imagine attaching the
tendons and muscles, then covering those with flesh and skin.
第十二段
1 .Now, although this method may seem complicated, artists since antiquity
have used anatomical observations to try to get the proportions of the
human figure as accurate as possible, though obviously not to the degree
that Alberti was recommending.
第十三段
1 .Now, in addition to characters, the setting is extremely important,
especially when attempting to tell a story realistically.
2 .Renaissance artists essentially needed to create a threedimensional
scene on a two-dimensional surface.
3 .They accomplished this by the use of perspective, a relatively new idea
for artists at the time.
4 .In particular, the type of perspective that Alberti advocated was called
Linear "One-point Perspective".
第十四段
1 .In fact, Alberti was one of the artists who developed the geometry behind
linear one-point perspective.
2 .Linear perspective basically consists of drawing straight lines that extend
from the forefront of the painting into the background, lines that seem to be
paralleled to each other, but which actually converge on a single point in
the horizon, called the vanishing point.
3 .By drawing figures and objects smaller and smaller, as the lines get
closer together, the artist is able to create depth
4 .in a painting. This gives the illusion of a third dimension, and makes the
work of art more realistic.
Lecture2
Listen to part of the lecture in a biology class.
第二段
1 .So that's the overview of the human immune system.
2 .But we have a few minutes left.
3 .Any questions? George?
第三段
1 .Yes. You talked about T-cells, naive T-cells.
2 .Can you go over that part again? And also why do we call them that
anyway?
第四段
1 .All right. They're...they're known as T-cells because they develop in the
thymus.
第五段
1 .The what?
第六段
1 .Thymus.
2 .That's T-H-Y-M-U-S.
3 .It's a small organ in the body.
4 .Anyway, that's why we call them that. They come from the thymus.
5 .And T-cells are a part of body's immune system.
6 .They can recognize and eliminate cells from outside the body that might
cause disease.
第七段
1 .But why naive?
2 .I mean, we might call people naive if they don't have enough experience
to know about the dangers of the world.
3 .But how can you call a cell naive?
第八段
1 .Well...when this type of immune cell encounters a cell from outside the
body, like maybe a bacterium.
2 .It interacts with that bacterium and learns to recognize it.
3 .So whenever the immune cell runs into that kind of bacterium in the
future, it'll attack and kill it.
4 .At that point we call it a memory T-cell because it's learned to recognize
a protein marker that identifies this particular kind of bacterium.
5 .But before it's learned to recognize any particular protein from outside
the body, we call it naive. Okay?
第九段
1 .Yeah, I get it.
第十段
1 .There is a lot of biochemistry involved that we'll get into in the next
lecture.
2 .But your question reminds me about a study that some of my colleagues
are doing.
3 .It relates to caloric restriction.
第十一段
1 .Caloric? Like calories in the food we eat.
第十二段
1 .Exactly! We are talking about the sugars, carbohydrates, fats that our
bodies burn to get energy which we measure in calories.
第十三段
1 .Okay, let's back up a little.
第十四段
1 .Back in the 1930s, a nutritionist at Cornell University put mice on a
severely restricted diet.
2 .He gave each mouse in one group thirty percent less food, or more
precisely, thirty percent fewer calories than the mice in the other group
which ate a normal amount.
3 .And the result, the underfed mice lived much longer than the normally
fed ones.
第十五段
1 .Wow! Does that just go for mice?
第十六段
1 .Apparently not.
2 .Similar results have come from experiments on other animals from
roundworms to most recently Rhesus monkeys.
第十七段
1 .These monkeys, two groups of them, were given all the vitamins and
minerals and other nutrients they needed, except that one group got thirty
percent fewer calories.
2 .And now after thirty years or so, about an average lifetime for a monkey,
it's clear that the monkeys that have been on the calorie restricted diet are
doing a lot better than the ones on that we consider a normal healthful diet.
3 .Like in terms of blood pressure and lots of other measures, the calorie
restricted monkeys are much healthier and they just look and act younger
than the monkeys in the normal diet group.
4 .And as a group, they are living longer.
第十八段
1 .Interesting. But what's the connection?
第一十九段
1 .Oh, with the immune system?
2 .Well, it is been shown that the immune system becomes much less
effective as animals age.
3 .That's true in humans too.
4 .We think those naive T-cells just get used up.
5 .I mean it is not like the body's always making lots of new ones.
6 .And over the course of a lifetime, as T-cells encounter more and more
strange bacteria or whatever, the naive T-cells get turned into memory Tcells.
7 .So later on in life, there are fewer and fewer of these naive T-cells left to
deal with any new diseasecausing organisms that might attack, which
means less immunity, and the animal or person is more likely to get sick.
第二十段
1 .But caloric restriction, it kind of shocks the system, and one result is,
well, those monkeys on the calorie-restricted diet had lots more naive Tcells left than you'd expect in monkeys that old.
2 .The expected drop in naive T-cells, apparently the shock of getting thirty
percent fewer calories really slows that down.
3 .And after many years, with so many more naive T-cells still in reserve,
these monkeys are a lot better at fighting off new infections than normally
fed monkeys of the same advanced age.
第二十一段
1 .And that's why they live longer?
第二十二段
1 .Well, it's got be one reason.
2 .This is all pretty complex though with lots of details yet to be worked out.
第二十三段
1 .But are results the same for humans?
第二十四段
1 .Hard to say.
2 .A good study would take decades. And it's not easy finding people who'd
want to take part, would you?
第二十五段
1 .And eat thirty percent less.
2 .That would be tough.
第二十六段
1 .You bet it would.
Conversation2
Listen to a conversation between a student and her economics professor.
第二段
1 .Excellent presentation you made at the end of class yesterday.
第三段
1 .Oh, thanks.
第四段
1 .Im so glad you volunteered to present first.Starting out by outlining what
you were going to say, then at the end summarizing the key points. It was
a very effective way of getting your points across.
第五段
1 .Im glad you think so. I was afraid it might come across as too formal.
2 .Not at all. In fact£, I think it's a great approach in general for these
presentations.
3 .So I hope the others were taking note, and the economic model you
discussed: build operate transfer. I think everyone was quite interested.
4 .I think everyone was quite interested.
第六段
1 .Yeah. It makes so much sense.
2 .If governments allow private companies to build public works like a
power plant and then operate it for a decade or two before transferring
ownership to the government, everyone benefits.
第七段
1 .Yes, the private companies make a profit.
2 .The public gets immediate infrastructure.
第八段
1 .And all without the government having to spend any money upfront,
which is amazing.
第九段
1 .Right.
第十段
1 .Anyway as I said in my presentation, this model is being used in Turkey
right now and you said when you handed out that brochure in class last
week, about the university's global enrichment initiative.
2 .You said one of the countries involves in that is Turkey.
第十一段
1 .Yes, that's right.
第十二段
1 .So I wanted to see if there's a chance the university sends fifteen
students overseas to study?
第十三段
1 .Fifteen students per country, fifteen for Turkey, fifteen for Brazil, fifteen
for Russia.
2 .We've got a total of six countries participating next summer.
第十四段
1 .Oh!
第十五段
1 .Yeah.
2 .And you spend six weeks in whichever country you are selected for. The
classroom component consists of seminars on that country's culture,
politics and economy.
3 .Most sessions are taught in English by local professors.
4 .But two of our faculty accompany each group and also give seminars.
5 .I'll be going to Brazil to teach a seminar on coffee next summer.
第十六段
1 .But you're an economist.
第十七段
1 .Coffee's played a central role in Brazil's economic development for over
200 years.
2 .About a third of the coffee consumed worldwide is produced in Brazil.
第十八段
1 .Oh I had no idea.
2 .Hmm...So if I applied, I mean, can students pick the country they want to
go to 'cause if I could go to Turkey...
第一十九段
1 .Well, the primary goal of the Global Enrichment Initiative is simply
cultural exchange.
2 .So students who've never been overseas before can broaden their
perspective.
3 .This is why on the application you are asked to indicate your first,
second and third choice countries.
第二十段
1 .I'm only interested in Turkey, though. I'm studying both Turkish and
Turkish history this term.
第二十一段
1 .I see.
第二十二段
1 .And maybe I could learn more about how they're implementing the build
operate transfer model there.
2 .Plus, I wouldn't want to take a spot away from someone who really
wanted to go to one of the other countries.
第二十三段
1 .Well. I guess you could leave the second and third choices blank.
Lecture3
Listen to part of the lecture in a chemistry class.
第二段
1 .So just to sum up, matter is anything that has mass and volume, right?
2 .Anything that takes up space. And this includes solids, liquids and
gases.
3 .And if we combine two portions of matter, we get a mixture.
第三段
1 .Now, there are two main kinds of mixtures: homogeneous and
heterogeneous.
2 .Maybe I should put this on the board.
3 .Whether a mixture is homogeneous or heterogeneous...
4 .well... this relates to the notion of phase.
5 .Remember we defined the word 'phase' as being one physical state,
whether solid, liquid or gas, that...
6 .well... that has distinct boundaries and uniform properties.
第四段
1 .So homogeneous mixtures... What are they?
第五段
1 .Okay. The prefix 'homo-' means 'same'.So a homogeneous mixture is
the same throughout.
2 .It contains only one phase.
3 .So if you put alcohol in water, the two liquids combine.
4 .They disperse into each other.
5 .And you can't perceive any boundary between the two any longer.
6 .So the mixture contains only one phase. Even though two phases went
into it, it now contains one phase and we can't detect any boundary
between the water and the alcohol once they're mixed together.
7 .The two portions combined form a single phase.
第六段
1 .Now, if homogeneous mixtures are ones that are the same throughout,
then what do you suppose heterogeneous mixtures are?
2 .Right. Mixtures that are different throughout.
第七段
1 .If you mix oil and water together, the mixture contains two liquid phases
because the oil will float on top of the water because of the oil's lower
density.
2 .They are not going to mix together like alcohol and water do.
3 .You can see the boundary between them and in fact, they are
mechanically separable.
第八段
1 .The same is true for soil, which is a mixture of solid materials.
2 .So if you look closely at a sample of soil, you are going to see bits of
sand, some black matter, maybe even pieces of vegetation.
3 .Since you can see all the different components, detect distinct
boundaries, we've got multiple phases.
4 .And in fact, you can pick out the components. The various portions can
be mechanically separated.
第九段
1 .Now, with some heterogeneous mixtures, you can see the different
phases with the naked eye.
第十段
1 .But that's not so for all of them, like smoke.
2 .Actually, that's a good example because to the naked eye it looks
uniform, like it's a single phase.
3 .But if you magnify it, you can see that there are tiny solid and liquid
particles suspended in the air.
4 .So actually what you got in smoke are three phases: solid, liquid and
gas, which you can separate by a process of filtration.
第十一段
1 .Another example, uh, dirty water. Okay?
第十二段
1 .That can be filtered too.
2 .Pass it through a filter and the dirt and whatever else is in there will stay
behind in the filter paper.
3 .And the clean water will pass through it.
4 .Again, depending on the size of the particles in the water, you might
need magnification to see them.
5 .But even so, they can be detected. The boundaries are detectable. So
multiple phases, okay?
第十三段
1 .Homogeneous mixtures, on the other hand, well, no amount of
magnification could reveal a detectable boundary between the
components.
2 .Their mixing extends all the way to the fundamental particle level.
3 .And we use the term ,solution, to refer to the single phase,
homogeneous mixtures.
第十四段
1 .When salts dissolve in water, no amount of magnification is going to
show you separate pieces of salt.
2 .There are no detectable boundaries between salt and water.
3 .So it's a solution.
第十五段
1 .Even so, what you can do with solutions is separate the parts by a
process called distillation.
2 .If you distill salt water, water gets boiled away from the solution and only
the salt remains behind.
3 .And in your next lab actually, we'll be using these processes, distillation
and filtration, to show how we can separate the different parts of some
mixtures.
第十六段
1 .Now, there are other ways we can describe mixtures.
2 .And one of these is by properties, uh, variable properties.
第十七段
1 .A real simple example of this is the taste and color of a cup of coffee.
2 .The more coffee that's dissolved in the water, the stronger the taste of
the coffee, and the darker the color, the darker the solution.
3 .So, color and taste, these are two variable properties.
4 .And these variable properties, they vary of course, because of the
relative amounts of the components, and the melting or freezing points of
liquids too.
5 .A solution of salt water, for example, will have a different freezing point
depending on how much salt is dissolved in the water.
Lecture4
Listen to part of a lecture in an anthropology class.
第二段
1 .OK, today we are go to be moving on and we're going to be talking about
early pottery.
2 .But rather than me just giving you a broad overview of how pots or
ceramic vessels were developed and used in different regions of the world,
we're gonna consider a specific example, a case study. And we're going to
focus on ceramic cooking vessels from just one part of the world.
第三段
1 .So the question I want to look at today concerns the use of ceramic
cooking vessels, clay pots, in the Arctic during ancient times.
2 .Why were they developed and used there?
第四段
1 .So, to begin with, we don't know for sure when human beings first
started creating pottery, but we have evidence of it from over 15,000 years
ago.
2 .And in the Arctic, ceramic cooking pots didn't appear there until some
2,500 years ago.
第五段
1 .Now, it's not surprising that they appeared relatively late there.
2 .In fact, what's been something of a mystery is why they were used at all,
in the Arctic, I mean.
3 .Ken?
第六段
1 .Why wouldn't they use pottery?
第七段
1 .Good question. What would some of the drawbacks of ceramic
containers be for ancient people groups in the Arctic?
2 .Ancient Arctic societies were nomadic, right?
第八段
1 .I get it! Clay pots are fragile.
2 .So if people were moving around all the time, well, the pots would
probably keep breaking.
第九段
1 .Precisely. Ceramic cooking vessels can't be transported easily.
2 .That's one thing.
第十段
1 .And think of how ceramics are produced.
2 .You need water and clay of course.
3 .You need to make the pot, allow it to dry for a long time.
4 .Warm, dry locations work best for this of course.
5 .And then you need to fire it, bake it. So you can see the role that climate
would play in whether or not ancient people created and used ceramic
cooking pots.
6 .And that's why manufacturing pottery would have been a challenge,
actually quite difficult for people in the Arctic.
第十一段
1 .But you're saying they did make ceramic cooking pots.
第十二段
1 .Yes. So the question is, given all these clear disadvantages, why would
Arctic people choose to make and use ceramic cooking vessels? Sue?
第十三段
1 .well, they made food easier to digest, something about making the
nutritional components of foods more accessible?
第十四段
1 .That's definitely true as far as many nutrients are concerned, but some
nutrients, like vitamin C, are destroyed by cooking.
2 .But the ancient Arctic people ate a diet that consisted almost entirely of
raw or only minimally cooked meat and fish or shellfish.
第十五段
1 .I saw something on television once, a documentary that talked about
how healthy the diet was, how it provided all of the nutrients they needed.
2 .I guess that would include vitamin C as well, but then what I don't
understand is: why would they have cooked their food at all?
第十六段
1 .Ah, here's where we need to look beyond obvious factors and consider
things like culinary preferences.
2 .Although the diet of ancient Arctic people mainly consisted of raw and
minimally cooked food, it was carefully prepared.
3 .It was based on an interplay of contrasts, um, different temperatures, or
hard and soft textures.
4 .Sometimes meat was only partially defrosted.
第十七段
1 .For example, one way of preparing meat was to boil it briefly, leaving the
center frozen.
2 .So cooked food, or partially cooked food, for ancient Arctic people, was
a matter of social preference.
第十八段
1 .So again, the question is - why did they use ceramic pots to cook their
food?
2 .That's not the only way to cook food. And we've already looked at some
disadvantages of ceramic pots.
3 .So why use them?
4 .Well, first of all, wood for cooking fires was in short supply.
5 .And because of the extreme climate, food had to be prepared inside,
indoors most of the year.
6 .Therefore, fires had to be small, and cooking methods had to be
efficient.
7 .So in regions of the Arctic where wood was scarce, and where the
houses could not withstand large fires and did not have good ventilation,
we do find advantages associated with ceramic pots.
TPO46
Conversation1
Listen to a conversation between a student and an employee in the student
housing office.
第二段
1 .Hi.I'm a first-year student here. I, I live in the dorms, and I, well, I like
where I'm living now. It's convenient and quiet, but I'm starting to think
about where I wanna live next year.
第三段
1 .Good idea.As a second-year, you have more freedom to choose a place
that suits your needs.
第四段
1 .Yeah!And I want to make sure that, well, that I apply in time to get what I
want.
2 .And, um, a friend was telling me about these common-interest houses
on campus.
第五段
1 .Yes. We have a language house, a life science house, a music house...
第六段
1 .Yeah, the music house.
2 .That's the one I'm interested in, but, um, I' m not a music major.
3 .I do play an instrument, but I'm a history major.
第七段
1 .Oh, that's not an issue.
2 .You see, that house isn't just for music majors. It's for anyone who's
interested in music.
第八段
1 .But isn't that everyone?
第九段
1 .Well, maybe. But the house has a performance area and practice rooms.
2 .So people who choose to live there need to be open to the possibility
that there's always gonna be someone playing something,
3 .an instrument, the radio, even at odd times. You're pretty much always
gonna hear music there.
4 .That might bother some people.
第十段
1 .Doesn't bother me. And I'd love to have a place to practice my
saxophone without worrying about disturbing people.
第十一段
1 .Well, it does sound like it might be a good fit for you.
2 .And the house also functions as a social club.
第十二段
1 .I know they do activities, but I don't know much beyond that.
第十三段
1 .Well, for example, every month, I think it is, there's an informal concert.
2 .Any house resident can perform.And remember that big jazz festival at
University Park last month?
第十四段
1 .Of course. It was amazing.
2 .The music was great. Um, I, I didn't connect it to the music house.
第十五段
1 .Not many people do.
2 .Anyway, they put on a whole range of other activities as well.
3 .Someone at the house could give you more information about those.
第十六段
1 .So, how do I...um, what's the process for getting a room there?
第十七段
1 .You need to fill out an application form and send it to the house director
2 .The form's on the housing department's website. But, don't get your
hopes up too high.
3 .They can only accept about 30% of students who apply.
第十八段
1 .Oh, wow, I had no idea.
第一十九段
1 .So, for your application, it needs to include a personal statement,
2 .you know, why you're interested in living in the house, how you might
contribute to the group. There are guidelines on the form.
3 .That statement's really important, because it's basically how they decide
who to accept into the house.
Lecture1
Listen to part of a lecture in a biology class.
第二段
1 .I'd like to continue our discussion of animal behavior, and start off
today's class by focusing on a concept we haven't yet touched upon:
swarm intelligence.
第三段
1 .Swarm intelligence is a collective behavior that emerges from a group of
animals like a colony of termites, a school of fish, or a flock of birds.
第四段
1 .Let's first consider the principles behind swarm intelligence and we'll use
the ant as our model.
第五段
1 .Now, an ant on its own is not that smart. When you have a group of ants,
however, there you have efficiency in action.
2 .You see, there is no leader running an ant colony. Each individual, each
individual ant operates by instinctively following a simple set of rules when
foraging for food.
第六段
1 .Rule number one: deposit a chemical marker called a pheromone.
2 .And rule two: follow the strongest pheromone path.
3 .The strongest pheromone path is advantageous to ants seeking food.
第七段
1 .So for example, when ants leave the nest, they deposit a pheromone
trail along the route they take.
2 .If they find food, they return to the nest on the same path,
3 .and the pheromone trail gets stronger.
4 .It's doubled in strength.
5 .Because an ant that took a shorter path returns first, its pheromone trail
is stronger and other ants will follow it according to rule two.
6 .And as more ants travel that path the pheromone trail gets even
stronger.
第八段
1 .So what's happening here?
第九段
1 .Each ant follows two very basic rules.
2 .And each ant acts on information it finds in its immediate local
environment.
3 .And it's i mportant to note, even though none of the individual ants is
aware of the bigger plan,
4 .they collectively choose the shortest path between the nest and the food
source,
5 .because it's the most reinforced path.
第十段
1 .By the way, a few you have asked me about the relevance of what we
are studying to everyday life.
2 .And swarm intelligence offers several good examples of how concepts in
biology can be applied to other fields.
第十一段
1 .Well, businesses have been able to use this approach of following
simple rules when designing complex systems.
2 .For instance, in telephone networks,
3 .when a call is placed from one city to another,
4 .it has to connect through a number of nodes along the way.
5 .At each point, a decision has to be made:which direction does the call go
from here?
第十二段
1 .Well, a computer program was developed to answer this question based
on rules that are similar to the ones that ants use to find food. Remember,
individual ants deposit pheromones and they follow the path that is most
reinforced.
第十三段
1 .Now, in the phone network,
2 .a computer monitors the connection speed of each path and identifies
the paths that are currently the fastest, the least crowded parts of the
network.
3 .And this information, converted into a numeric code, is deposited at the
network nodes.
4 .This reinforces the paths that are least crowded at the moment.
5 .The rule the telephone network follows is to always select the path that
is most reinforced. So similar to the ant's behavior,
6 .at each intermediate node, the call follows the path that is most
reinforced.
7 .This leads to an outcome which is beneficial to the network as a whole
and calls get through faster.
第十四段
1 .But getting back to animal behavior,
2 .another example of swarm intelligence is the way flocks of birds are able
to fly together so cohesively.
3 .How do they coordinate their movements and know where they're
supposed to be?
第十五段
1 .Well, it basically boils down to three rules that each bird seems to follow.
第十六段
1 .Rule one:stay close to nearby birds.
第十七段
1 .Rule two:avoid collision with nearby birds.
第十八段
1 .And rule three:move in the average speed and direction of nearby birds.
第一十九段
1 .Oh, and by the way, if you're wondering how this approach can be of
practical use for humans,
2 .the movie industry's been trying create computer-generated flocks of
birds in movie scenes.
第二十段
1 .The question was:how to do it easily on a large scale?
2 .A researcher used these three rules in a computer graphics program,
and it worked.
3 .There have also been attempts to create computer-generated crowds of
people using this bird flocking model of swarm intelligence.
第二十一段
1 .However, I'm not surprised that more research is needed.
2 .The three rules I mentioned might be great for bird simulations, but they
don't take into account the complexity and unpredictability of human
behavior.
3 .So, if you want to create crowds of people in a realistic way,
4 .that computer model might be too limited.
Lecture2
Listen to part of a lecture in an art history class.
第二段
1 .As you know, portrait artists often position their subjects so that their
head is turned a little to one side,
2 .thereby presenting the artist with a semi-side view, a semi-profile view.
第三段
1 .And for some reason, western European artists have historically tended
to show the left һ side of the subject's face, more than the right.
第四段
1 .A while back, some researchers examine about 1,500 portraits painted
from the 16th to the 20th century in Western Europe.
2 .And in the majority of them is the left һ side of the face that's most
prominently displayed.Why is that?
第五段
1 .And interestingly enough, this tendency to show the left side has
diminished over time,
2 .especially in the 20th century.
3 .In fact, the leftһ right ratio is now about 1:1.50% left 50% right.
第六段
1 .Why is that?
第七段
1 .We do know that for many artists, the choice of left side, right side was
very important.
2 .There is an image by the Dutch painter Vincent Van Gogh called the
Potato Eaters that shows the profiles of a group of farmers.
3 .It's a lithograph, which is a print made from i mages drawn on a stone.
4 .When you print something that way, what you get is a mirror image of
the original picture.
5 .The exact same image, except that left and right are reversed,
6 .and Van Gogh was so dissatisfied with the print that he wrote to his
brother,
7 .quote "the figures, I'm sorry to say, are now turned the wrong way." end
quote.
第八段
1 .Anyway, why do you think so many painters in the past chose to depict
the left side of their subjects' face? Nancy.
第九段
1 .Could it have to do with whether the artists were left-handed or righthanded,
2 .like maybe most of them were right-handed, and maybe for some reason
they feel more comfortable painting the left side?
第十段
1 .Ok, many right-handed artists do find it easier to paint left profiles, and
many art historians think that's the reason for the directional bias.
2 .But if that hypothesis, let's call it the right-handed hypothesis, was
correct,
3 .you'd expect that left-handed artists would find it easier to paint right
profiles.
4 .But the research suggests that left-handed artists find it just as easy to
paint left profiles as right.
5 .So any other ideas?
第十一段
1 .Well, another theory is what's known as the parental imprinting
hypothesis,
2 .which proposes that people are more used to seeing left profiles
because supposedly right-handed parents are more likely to hold their
babies in their left arm.
第十二段
1 .Well, my sister just had a baby and she keeps talking about how her left
arm is getting so much stronger than her right.
第十三段
1 .Ok, so there's some anecdotal evidence.
第十四段
1 .So, then when the baby looks up at their parent, what they see is the left
profile.
第十五段
1 .Right. And so the theory goes:the left side of the face becomes imprinted
in our memories.
第十六段
1 .But the parental imprinting hypothesis doesn't explain why left profiles
have decreased over time.
2 .I mean, parents are still carrying their babies in their left arm, right?
第十七段
1 .Exactly! All right, what about the way the artists' studio is organized,
specifically the light source.
第十八段
1 .Remember that the light source determines where the shadows are.
2 .So, if you're a right-handed artists, you'd want to the light coming from
your left because you don't want your painting hand to cast a shadow
across your canvas, right?
3 .And if the light's coming from your left,
4 .ou'd want your subject to turn to their right into the light. If they do that,
what do you see?
第一十九段
1 .The left side of their face.
第二十段
1 .Exactly, and well into the 20th century,
2 .many an artist's primary light source would be the sun.
3 .And they set up their studio to take maximum advantage of it.
4 .But then what happens as other high-quality, portable, artificial light
sources become available?
第二十一段
1 .Well, you could position your subject in a lot more different ways and still
have good lighting on your subject and on your canvas.
第二十二段
1 .So...?
第二十三段
1 .You'd expect to see a more balanced ratio of left- and right-side
portraits.
Conversation2
Listen to part of a conversation between a student and her history
professor.
第二段
1 .So I definitely want to write my term paper on American journalism in the
eighteenth century.
2 .That old copy of the New York Daily Gazette you showed us,
3 .the one printed from the library's microfilm.
4 .Just seeing a newspaper that was published in 1789...that was really
cool!
第三段
1 .Yes, reading old newspapers can be a powerful experience,
2 .especially to a budding historian like yourself.
3 .As a resource for scholars and researchers, I don't think any form of
publication really captures the day-to-day life of a community better than a
local newspaper.
第四段
1 .Yeah, I mean, I knew that the number of newspapers exploded in the
18th century,
2 .but I figured they all deteriorated before the technology was invented to
preserve them, or you know, make copies.
第五段
1 .Well, actually, before the mid-1800s, newspapers were printed on fairly
sturdy paper made from cotton fibers.
2 .Those that survived are in surprisingly good shape.
第六段
1 .Are there many more copies of the Gazette on microfilm?
第七段
1 .Yeah, we've got a great microfilm library on campus.
2 .You'll find it invaluable, I'm sure, as you research your paper.
3 .Um, but also talk to the librarians because they are creating an online
archive of their microfilm collection.
4 .l'm not sure of the project's status,
5 .but if it's done, it'll probably save you time.
第八段
1 .So, um, 18th һ century journalism, you must realize that that topic is too
broad for this assignment.
第九段
1 .I do. So one idea I had was like looking at an important world event like
maybe the French revolution of 1789, since we just finished a unit on it.
2 .The readings you've given us were incredibly vivid.I loved them, but they
were translations of French writers, historians.
3 .So I thought it'd be interesting to pick the Gazette and one other
American newspaper to see how each covered the revolution,
4 .how the journalists reported it from America's perspective.
第十段
1 .Hmm, interesting approach.But remember, I'll be grading your paper
based on the details you include.
2 .And at some point in your paper,
3 .you'll want to focus on a particular event of the revolution like maybe the
storming of the Bastille prison.
第十一段
1 .How about the formation of the French national constituent assembly?
第十二段
1 .Sure! That would work.
第十三段
1 .And since I'm gonna look at newspapers from two cities,
2 .I could read the editorials, the opinion pieces,
3 .to find out what each community thought about the national assembly.
第十四段
1 .Ok, but, you know, I once attended a history conference where a
professor presented a paper on the American press in the French
Revolution.
2 .She was discussing the development of democratic ideals here and in
France at that time.
3 .But she also pointed out that using old newspapers as primary sources...
to be aware that they reflected the values of only a segment of society,
4 .and should not be used to draw conclusions about a Americans.
5 .I don't think I held on to her paper, but it was subsequently published,
6 .so you'll have no trouble tracking it down on the Internet.
7 .Let me give you her name.
Lecture3
Listen to part ofthe Iecture in an art historv Class.
第二段
1 .Okay. So, When We Were discussing GainSborough's painting, the Blue
Boy,
2 .Which he painted in 1770, I mentioned the story that the painting might
have been an experiment.
3 .The result of a Challenge.
4 .lt was believed that blue couldn't be an important color in a painting
because...Well...it tends to recede into the background.
5 .Not good for your main subject, right?
第三段
1 .So to show otherwise, Gainsborough created the Blue Boy,
2 .with the boy featured large in his famous blue clothes...and...well...l
guess he proved his point.
第四段
1 .But there was another challenge to blue.
2 .It was very very expensive back then.
3 .Now of course, because of modern chemistry, any color is available in
tubes at any art supply store.
4 .But in the 18th century and before, it wasn't so easy.
第五段
1 .And blue...well...the color ultramarine, the most desired shade of blue,
2 .was made from the precious stone, Lapis Lazuli, which had to be
imported all the way from Afghanistan.
第六段
1 .And the second most favorite shade of blue,
2 .after ultramarine made from Lapis Lazuli, was a shade a blue that came
from another precious stone, Azurite.
第七段
1 .But Azurite was...well...harder to work with.
2 .There's evidence that artists would try to get around these difficulties.
3 .For example, use pigment from lapis lazuli or azurite very sparingly,
4 .and also use something cheaper, like smalt, which was made of ground
glass.
5 .Thing is, smalt became discolored over time.
6 .So many artists probably avoided blues altogether rather than use
something cheap and impermanent.
第八段
1 .So, blue, and especially ultramarine pigment,
2 .was a luxury, a status symbol, worth even more than gold at times.
3 .And you even have the wealthy ordering paintings with ultramarine to
show others that they could afford something made from this precious
pigment,
4 .much in the same way they would order gold leaf.
第九段
1 .Actually, the ancient Egyptians did manage to make an artificial blue,
2 .the first synthetic pigment in fact, if you can believe that.
3 .They passed the formula on to the Greeks and Romans, but then it was
lost.
第十段
1 .Anyway, not only was lapis lazuli hard to get, it was also hard to
process.
2 .The recipe was difficult.
3 .The stone had to be ground finely, not easy to do with a rock,
4 .then mixed with melted wax, resins and oils, wrapped in a cloth and
knitted like bread dough.
5 .The fine particles of ultramarine were then separated from the rest.
6 .The process was time-consuming, which also contributed to the high
cost of producing ultramarine,
7 .and it didn't even yield much usable pigment.
第十一段
1 .As a result, the French government sponsored a competition in 1824 to
find a cheaper way to make ultramarine pigment.
2 .And soon after a process was demonstrated where a combination of
coal,
3 .sulfur and other cheap, commonplace substances were heated, creating
a suitable synthetic substitute for lapis lazuli.
第十二段
1 .So there's no doubt that 19th-century artists,
2 .after good synthetic versions were available, used more ultramarine.
3 .Think of the impressionists, for example.
4 .They had a lot more choices or at least, less expensive choices, than
painters not that long before them.
Lecture4
Listen to part of a lecture in a materials science class.
第二段
1 .So what's the first thing that comes to mind when we talk about uses for
copper? Tammy?
第三段
1 .The penny. It's made of copper.
第四段
1 .Okay, good one. But what's a one cent coin worth these days?
2 .You might get back change.
3 .Like if you go to the store and give the cashier 5 dollars for something
that costs 4 dollars 98 cents,
4 .you'll get 2 cents back, but 2 cents does not buy much.
5 .The value of the penny in terms of what it'll buy has gotten so low that
there's actually a move afoot to eliminate the coin from US currency.
6 .But there's more to it.
第五段
1 .As Tammy implied, the penny looks like it's solid copper.
2 .It is reddish orange with a bright metallic luster when it's new, but that's
just the copper plating.
3 .The penny's not solid copper.
4 .In actuality, it is almost 98 percent zinc.
第六段
1 .But given the rising value of both these metals, each penny now costs
about 1.7 cents to produce.
2 .So it generates what is called negative Seigniorage.
第七段
1 .Negative seigniorage is when the cost of minting a coin is more than the
coin's face value.
2 .Even though the penny generates quite a bit of negative seigniorage,
3 .there is concern that if it's eliminated,
4 .we'll need more nickels, because more merchants might start setting
prices in five-cent increments, 4 dollars 95 cents and so on.
5 .So we need a trusty five-cent piece that can be minted economically.
6 .But the nickel's negative seigniorage is even worse than the pennies.
7 .Each nickel costs the US mint 10 cents to produce.
第八段
1 .Also, some of us are pretty attached to pennies for whatever reason,
nostalgia, and then those collectors.
2 .And people, if they see a penny on the sidewalk, they'll pick it up and
think: it is my lucky day!
第九段
1 .Another scenario is that, without pennies, merchants, instead of charging
5.98,
2 .might round up the price to an even five dollars.
3 .So consumer goods would become slightly more expensive.
4 .But on the other hand, some cash transactions would be more
convenient for consumers.
5 .And as I said, the government would save money if pennies were
eliminated.
第十段
1 .But wouldn't the copper industry suffer financially if the US government
stopped buying copper to make pennies?
第十一段
1 .But how much copper do pennies actually contain?
第十二段
1 .How much...Oh, got it, right.
第十三段
1 .So what else comes to mind when you think about copper?
2 .What else is copper used for?
第十四段
1 .I know that copper can be shaped into all sorts of things:
2 .sheets, tubing, and my cousin's house has a copper roof.
第十五段
1 .Yes, like gold and silver, copper is extremely malleable,
2 .but it's not a precious metal, it's far less expensive than gold or silver.
3 .It's also a superb conductor of electricity so you can stretch it into wires
which go into appliances and even car motors.
第十六段
1 .Copper also has superior alloying properties, it's...you know, when it's
combined with other metals.
第十七段
1 .For instance, how many of you play a brass instrument, like a trumpet or
a trombone?
第十八段
1 .Well, brass is an alloy of copper and zinc.
2 .If your trombone was made of pure copper or pure zinc, it wouldn't
sound nearly as beautiful as a brass trombone.
第一十九段
1 .Another alloy, a combination of copper and nickel, resists corrosion.
2 .It does not rust, even with prolonged exposure to water.
第二十段
1 .But what about the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor?
2 .It's made of pure copper, but it turned green.
3 .Isn't that a sign of corrosion?
第二十一段
1 .Indirectly. If copper's exposed to damp air, its color changes from
reddish orange to reddish brown.
第二十二段
1 .But in time, a green film, called a patina, forms and the patina actually
serves to halt any further corrosion.
2 .It is one reason that ship hulls are made of copper-nickel alloys.
3 .These alloys are also hard for the barnacles to stick to.
4 .If these little shellfish adhere to the hull of a ship, it produces drag,
slowing the vessel down.
第二十三段
1 .Copper's also a key material used in solar heating units and in water
desalination plants,
2 .which will play increasingly important roles in society.
第二十四段
1 .Bottom line: if you are a copper miner, you won't lose any sleep should
the penny get...
2 .if you'll excuse the expression, pinched out of existence.
TPO47
Conversation1
Listen to a conversation between a student and a music director.
第二段
1 .Miss Harper?
第三段
1 .Yes, can I help you?
第四段
1 .Hi, my name's Eric Paterson. I'm a journalism student.
2 .I wanted to ask you about the orchestra.
第五段
1 .I' m sorry, Eric. But the orchestra is only open to music majors.
第六段
1 .Really? Well, see...
第七段
1 .But the policy is changing next year.
2 .After that, if you've taken three music courses, you will be able to
audition.
第八段
1 .Well, I have taken some music courses and I do play the double bass.
So, maybe that's something to think about.
2 .But, actually, I was here about something else.
第九段
1 .Oh, sorry. It's I... I get that question all the time. So...
第十段
1 .That's okay. The thing is I work for Magna - the school paper and I am
reporting on last week's concert.
2 .Now I went to it and I really enjoyed it, but now I'm looking for some
background knowledge.
第十一段
1 .Well, I can refer you to some of the students in the orchestra if you'd like
a young musician's point of view.
第十二段
1 .Uh...l guess that might be helpful. But...um...l am really looking for a little
bit of scholarly prospective.
2 .Some history of the music that was performed that evening, where it
originated, how it's developed over time.
第十三段
1 .Well, some of our musicians kind of specialize in Appalachian music.
2 .In fact, that's part of the reason we performed it.
3 .So you really should talk to them, too.
4 .Okay, so we were playing Appalachian music from communities in the
Appalachian Mountain regions of the United States.
第十四段
1 .All right.
第十五段
1 .Uh...Do you really think you can keep these all in your head?
第十六段
1 .Oh, don't worry.
2 .All I need are a few key facts. I'm sure I can keep them straight until I get
back to my dorm.
第十七段
1 .So the music is generally based on folk ballads and instrumental dance
tunes. It started with Scottish and Irish immigrants who brought over their
styles of music.
2 .It's called Anglo-Celtic.
第十八段
1 .So, people brought their musical traditions with them.
第一十九段
1 .Well, this Anglo-Celtic music was considered an important link to the
past for these people, which you can see in the way that Appalachian
singers sing ballads.
2 .They have sort of a nasal quality to them, like in Celtic ballads.
3 .In their new land, some of the lyrics were updated,
4 .you know, to refer the new locations and the occupations that settlers
had in America.
5 .But at the same time, lots of ballads were still about castles and
royalty,lords and ladies, stuff like that, which is what they were about
originally.
第二十段
1 .Okay. And was that some sort of banjo I saw on stage during the
performance?
第二十一段
1 .Yes, we are lucky that one of our students, Stewart Telford, has a
nineteenth-century banjo, a real antique.
2 .He's able to play in most of the traditional styles.
第二十二段
1 .Did you know that banjos are of African-American origin and that settlers
in Appalachia adopted banjos for their folk music?
2 .They became very common in traditional Appalachian music along with
guitars and violins, of course.
3 .But if you want to learn about that banjo, talk to Stewart.
第二十三段
1 .That's great, Miss Harper. Thanks a lot.
2 .Now, can you recommend any sources where I could look up more about
this?
3 .Sure, I have a great book.
4 .A student has it today, but you can borrow it tomorrow if you'd like.
Lecture1
Listen to part of the lecture in a literature class.
第二段
1 .So, urn, in France, you have the French Academy, which was created to
uphold standards of literary taste.
2 .It was a very conservative organization.
3 .It tried to keep things a certain way...uh...resist change.
第三段
1 .It dictated that French plays should neoclassical in form, you know, have
five acts, sophisticated language, etc.
2 .But try as it might, it couldn't stop change.
3 .French drama was changing, though the transition from neoclassical
drama to Romantic drama was itself pretty dramatic.
第四段
1 .Let's look at a play by Victor Hugo called Hernani, or as the French
would say, Hernani.
2 .Although Hugo was a truly brilliant writer of essays, poems, novels, and
plays, uh, his play, Hernani, isn't a great play in and of itself.
3 .It's got a really confusing, convoluted storyline.
4 .Critics back then were unimpressed by it,
5 .though it's likely that their own feelings about how plays should be,
6 .neoclassical or romantic, affected their opinions about it.
第五段
1 .But its premiere in Paris, in 1830, was anything but ordinary.
2 .Hernani's opening night was probably one of the most important literary
events in 19th century France!
第六段
1 .What happened was...OK. Hugo was a Romanticist, right?
2 .He was part of a growing movement of young authors and artists who
were rebelling against neoclassicism,
3 .against the conventions of neoclassicism.
4 .And what this meant is that Hugo opposed the neoclassical unities that
French theater had inherited from Greek drama.
5 .These unities were basically the unity of time, space and action,
6 .meaning that the entire play consisted of just one main event that was
unfolding in just one specific place,
7 .usually in the course of one day.
第七段
1 .And Hugo found this to be too constraining.
2 .He looked for inspiration in...well...OK.
3 .Hugo is from the 19th century, but he looked to Shakespeare,
4 .several centuries in the past, long before neoclassicism.
第八段
1 .For example, in Shakespeare's play, A Midsummer Night's Dream,
2 .the play moves from indoors to outdoors, from the city to the forest, and
back again.
3 .So there was a kind of mobility in...in the use of space. And...well...in A
Midsummer Night's Dream,
4 .of course the action in that play takes place on a single summer's night,
5 .but in Shakespeare's other plays, in Hamlet, for example, ti me elapses.
6 .People travel; they go to other destinations.
7 .And the action is not limited to one plot.
第九段
1 .Hugo also opposed the neoclassical insistence on the separation of
genres.
2 .For a neoclassicist, a play could only be dramatic and high art, or comic,
well, light-hearted.
3 .And in either case, there was still a sense of decorum.
4 .Characters might make jokes and get into silly situations, but they're still
regular people, like not in disguise or anything.
5 .There's still a certain amount of restraint in a neoclassical comedy.
第十段
1 .Again, earlier works by Shakespeare provided very different models that
Hugo found more appealing.
2 .Many of Shakespeare's plays, even the tragedies, contain scenes with
ridiculous, outlandish characters like clowns, so that many of the plays
have both qualities: a serious dramatic side and comedic scenes with the
clowns that break the drama.
第十一段
1 .And Hugo, like other Romantics, was also opposed to the artistic rules
that the neoclassicists had inherited from the Enlightenment.
2 .The Romantics wanted a more passionate kind of theater and it was
more rooted in the individual and the individual sensibility.
第十二段
1 .Romanticism was political as well, claiming that individuals, people,
could govern themselves,
2 .without the need for kings and queens.
3 .There was an ideological struggle between a lot of young people, artists,
people who wanted change, and people who didn't.
4 .So of course Romanticism was controversial.
第十三段
1 .Now, Hernani was a play that incorporated these Romantic conventions.
2 .Hugo suspected that neoclassical audiences would be hostile to this new
form and the ideas it represented.
3 .So to protect himself, he rounded up his friends for opening night.
4 .And hundreds of them came to the theater that night.
第十四段
1 .And Hugo writes about this arrival of the Romantics,
2 .these wild and bizarre characters and their outlandish customs,
3 .which stupefied and infuriated the more conventional theater-goers.
4 .So the play that night took forever to finish because it was interrupted
many times and there were these debates in the audience,
5 .between Hugo's friends and supporters, the Romantics, and the
Neoclassicists, the supporters of the old school.
6 .Lots of interruptions!
第十五段
1 .And afterward, what had been a debate inside the theater spilled out
onto the street and there were fist fights.
2 .It was a complete free-for-all. And this went on for the next forty-five
nights.
3 .Every night that the play was performed,
4 .there was this excitement and controversy that was,
5 .was really an expression of the kinds of passions that...uh...differences
of aesthetics and political opinions and taste could give rise to.
Lecture2
Listen to part of a lecture in a biology class.
第二段
1 .Now usually when we talk about birds flying long distances, we're
discussing seasonal migration.
2 .But there's some species that fly long distances not as part of a
migration but as part of their regular foraging for food.
3 .A great example is the albatross.
第三段
1 .Albatross are seabirds that nest on islands and forage for food out in the
open sea.
2 .And you have one species that forages an average of a thousand miles
from its nest.
3 .And I read in another study where one albatross left a chick in its nest
and went out in search of food.
4 .And by the time it got back to the nest, it has flown nine thousand miles.
Yes, Bob?
第四段
1 .But why don't they just build their nest closer to their food supply?
2 .I mean, for one thing, they must burn up a lot of energy flying back and
forth and also the parents are gonna have to be away from the nest that
much.
3 .Aren't the chicks gonna be pretty hungry most of the time?
第五段
1 .Ok, good question.
2 .The chicks are capable of going for long periods of time without food,
3 .which works out nicely since as you point out, they may not get to eat
that often.
第六段
1 .As far as the parents go, well, first, they typically can't get enough food
in a single location.
2 .So they have to visit several places on the same foraging trip.
3 .And the locations of good foraging grounds tend to be very far apart.
第七段
1 .And second, they can't always nest on an island that's closest to the best
feeding ground because some of those islands have too many predators
on them.
2 .Predators that would just love some little chicks to snack on.
3 .So I don't think they have much choice.
第八段
1 .But it still works out because albatross fly using a technique called
dynamic soaring,
2 .which enables them to cover very long distances while expending very
little energy.
3 .If it weren't for that, you'd be right. They would probably burn up all their
energy just flying back and forth.
第九段
1 .Another factor is albatross lay only one egg at a time.
2 .So when the parent returns with the food that one chick doesn't have to
share it with a lot of other chicks.
3 .Yes, Nancy?
第十段
1 .So you're saying that they might easily fly a thousand miles over the
open ocean when they're looking for food?
第十一段
1 .That's right.
第十二段
1 .Then how do they know how to get to the food?
2 .I mean, which direction to take to get to the food and how do they find
their way back home?
第十三段
1 .Good point.
2 .And the truth is we are not sure.
3 .It's very difficult to keep seabirds in captivity where you can study them.
4 .And it's very difficult to study them in the wild, you know.
第十四段
1 .But we think that a lot of what we've learnt about songbirds probably
applies to seabirds as well.
2 .So we're thinking that albatross could make use of two different kinds of
compasses if you will, a magnetic compass and a celestial compass.
第十五段
1 .The magnetic compass somehow makes use of Earth's magnetic field,
2 .much the way a standard compass does.
3 .But to prove this, we would have to find some kind of magnetic sensory
organ in birds.
4 .And we are not sure that we have.
5 .We have found in birds a mineral called magnetite,
6 .which we think might be somehow related to this, because magnetite is a
natural magnet.
7 .But the problem is that we've also found magnetite in non-migratory
birds,
8 .which suggests that it may in fact serve a completely different function,
not related to navigation at all.
第十六段
1 .Um, and the other compass, the celestial compass makes use of the
stars, more or less the same way humans have historically used the stars
to navigate in the open sea.
2 .So that's the way we think albatross navigate.
第十七段
1 .So anyway, you know, think about it,
2 .how about if you had to go a thousand miles every time you wanted to
get a bite to eat?
第十八段
1 .Yeah, and we complain about having to walk all the way across campus
to get to the cafeteria.
第一十九段
1 .Yeah.
Conversation2
Listen to a conversation between a student and his professor.
第二段
1 .This is not what I had in mind when I assigned a film review.
第三段
1 .It isn't?
第四段
1 .No. What you wrote is a synopsis, a detailed summary of the movie, but
it's not a review.
第五段
1 .It's not? I guess I'm a little confused cuz...isn't that what a film review
does?
2 .You know, describe the film?
第六段
1 .Sure. In part. But a good review has to do more.
2 .But this is probably not your fault.
3 .I'm starting to think that I should have explained the assignment better
because...well...I got a lot of summaries and very few reviews.
第七段
1 .So it wasn't only me.
第八段
1 .Hardly. I just assumed that everyone would know what to do.
第九段
1 .So...um...what else is a review supposed to do?
第十段
1 .Well, it should also analyze the film, discuss its strengths and
weaknesses,
2 .maybe compare it to other movies,
3 .even mention why the reviewer did or didn't like it.
第十一段
1 .You mean it should have been more personal?
第十二段
1 .For starters, or maybe subjective is a better word than personal.
2 .Yes. It should have been more subjective.
第十三段
1 .Maybe I could rewrite it?
2 .Well, I don't know about rewriting it.
3 .Too many people seemed to have missed the point.
4 .I think I may have to forgo evaluating this one.
5 .Instead maybe we'll just devote a class to discussing what it takes to
write a good film review.
6 .Or maybe...hmm...you know, I have a colleague who writes film reviews
for the local paper.
7 .Maybe I could ask her to come to class and describe what she does and
then have everyone rewrite their reviews.
第十四段
1 .So, she would talk about what a film review should be like, so we'd know
what to do.
第十五段
1 .Well, more than that.
2 .A professional film reviewer gets to see movies sometimes before they
are even released.
3 .They get advance copies —— usually a video or DVD —— to watch at
home or they go to a movie as soon as it opens in the theaters.
第十六段
1 .Um...seeing it on the big screen in a theater, doesn't that affect the
experience?
第十七段
1 .Of course! Having other people there can...can affect the review, too.
第十八段
1 .So, for the next assignment, I might ask everyone to review one of the
films the film club shows every weekend at the theater on campus.
2 .There is no admission charge.
3 .They are free to students and the movies are shown on Friday and
Saturday nights, plus Sunday afternoon.
4 .So, everyone should be able to see one.
5 .Yeah, that should work.
第一十九段
1 .But for this time, will we have to rewrite our reviews?
第二十段
1 .Well, let's take it one thing at a time.
2 .Let me talk to my colleague.
Lecture3
Listen to part of a lecture in a sports management class.
第二段
1 .So, I want to end today with a topic that many of you have questions
about when you come to see me during my office hours.
2 .A lot of you have told me you are specifically interested in careers as
coaches.
第三段
1 .Now, it doesn't matter what sport you are interested in coaching,
volleyball, basketball, swimming...
2 .There are some considerations for all new coaches to think about as
they plan their careers.
第四段
1 .A recent study, a survey of high school head coaches,
2 .helped identify some obstacles,
3 .some things that head coaches felt they were not prepared for as they
began their careers.
4 .They were surveyed to determine what things they would do differently if
they were starting their careers over again.
5 .Based on their responses, several themes emerged.
第五段
1 .The largest number of responses was in the area of relationships.
2 .79% of the coaches indicated that if they had to do it all over again,
3 .they would do things differently in this area.
4 .They said they'd deal differently with assistant coaches, parents, student
athletes, school administration, and, and pay more attention to those
relationships.
第六段
1 .The second most critical area for these coaches was organization and
administration.
2 .To them, this meant things like better managing their budgets,
3 .and delegating responsibilities, making sure that even minor things were
taken care of,
4 .like pre-game meals, those sort of things.
第七段
1 .Excuse me, professor,
2 .I know good nutrition is important, but organizing pre-game meals isn't
really something you consider when you are thinking about going into
coaching as a career.
第八段
1 .No, I guess not, Kenny,
2 .but it's more an example of paying attention to the details, being
organized.
第九段
1 .I do want to emphasize that the profession of coaching is about more
than just wins and losses.
2 .In fact, winning is probably stressed too much.
3 .At its best, I'd say coaching, especially in high school and college,
4 .is about teaching life skills through game strategy.
5 .Of course, coaching requires a specialized body of knowledge.
6 .If you coach tennis, you need to know the rules of tennis.
7 .If you are a football coach, you need to know all about football
strategies.
8 .And those are the sorts of things that you'll get in your classes here at
the university.
9 .But if coaches spend too much of their time on game strategy,
10 .well, you see, maybe that's secondary too, to the knowledge and skills,
11 .you'll need for the other roles you'll undertake as a coach,
12 .especially, as that survey emphasized,
13 .skills in dealing with people, and, and administration.
第十段
1 .But, how do you...
2 .how do you improve in those areas, I mean, I'm gonna be an assistant
coach at a high school beginning next month, and ...
第十一段
1 .Really? Nice going, Kenny!
第十二段
1 .Yes, that's wonderful!
第十三段
1 .Thanks. I'm excited.
第十四段
1 .So, congratulations!
2 .Ok, well, to get better organized, one thing is take courses in business
management and not just the sports management courses in the physical
education department,
3 .other business and finance courses.
4 .Oh, oh, but wait a minute.
5 .You said you are starting next month?
6 .What sport will you be coaching?
第十五段
1 .Uh, gymnastics, mainly.
第十六段
1 .Okay, in my career, I've learned, well, as part of building and maintaining
strong relationships and working on administrative skills,
2 .you've got to consider the other needs of your team beyond the sport
itself.
3 .Remember, the team members are athletes and students,
4 .and remember, if you are enthusiastic about what you are doing,
5 .well, enthusiasm is...is catching, right?
6 .You want team members to enjoy participating.
第十七段
1 .Right, but what about setting rules for your team, and, is it better to be
strict or not so strict?
第十八段
1 .Actually, I don't believe in having a lot of rules.
2 .And coaches often do have too many.
3 .I think that can get in the way of leadership and box you in.
4 .I think people sometimes set rules just to make things easier for
themselves.
5 .That way maybe later they just can refer to the rule and avoid making a
choice.
6 .You know that kind of person I'm talking about, right?
第一十九段
1 .But that's not to say the team shouldn't have any rules at all.
2 .Of course they need some.
3 .So early in a season, or when you first take a new job,
4 .establish a few basic ground rules for what is acceptable and nonacceptable behavior.
第二十段
1 .So, what are some good ones?
第二十一段
1 .Well, a...a couple rules a coach should have are:
2 .insist that players be on time, and insist that they practice hard, and give
their best effort.
3 .And when you do establish a rule, stick to it.
Lecture4
Listen to part of the lecture in a meteorology class.
第二段
1 .Now, Earth's atmosphere is sort of like a giant weather machine, right?
2 .Uh...with air and water being its key components.
3 .A machine powered by energy from the Sun.
4 .So we need to consider the role that air, or more specifically, wind, plays
in this machine.
5 .So wind is really nothing more than moving air, right?
第三段
1 .Now, as air is heated and becomes warmer, it expands, it becomes less
dense.
2 .When air in a particular area is heated,
3 .you get a concentration of warm air in an area of low pressure.
4 .Likewise, when you get a concentration of cold air,
5 .that air's gonna be very dense, so it's gonna create an area of high
pressure.
6 .If you have an area of high pressure next to an area of low pressure,
7 .the colder, high pressure air will start moving toward the area of low
pressure.
8 .Right? And the warmer air will move away, rising above the cooler air.
Okay?
第四段
1 .Uh...yes. Linda?
第五段
1 .So wind is actually generated by the Sun?
第六段
1 .Well, Earth's rotation plays a role.
2 .And there are other factors and we'll come back to all that.
3 .But, principally, yes. The Sun creates the temperature differential that
creates the areas of high pressure and low pressure that create wind.
第七段
1 .Um...l don't get what...how it causes a temperature differential.
第八段
1 .Right. Good. This will take us to the role of wind in the climate.
2 .The key is that the Sun warms up different parts of Earth at different
rates and to different degrees.
3 .For example, at sunrise, the land heats up faster than the ocean.
4 .That's why you get morning sea breezes.
5 .The air over the water heats more slowly than air overland,
6 .so during the early morning, it's cooler and denser than air overland,
7 .so it moves in toward land.
8 .A sea breeze.
第九段
1 .What else?
第十段
1 .The Sun's energy is more intense near the equator than it is near the
poles,
2 .so you've got masses of warmer air over the equatorial regions,
3 .and masses of cooler air over Polar Regions.
4 .And these masses are constantly interacting with each other, which is
critically important for Earth's climate.
第十一段
1 .One result of these interactions is that equatorial air masses move away
from the equator and in the process those equatorial winds actually take
heat away from the equator and transfer it to some cooler part of Earth.
2 .And by redistributing this energy, the Sun's energy really,
3 .winds play a critical role in maintaining a temperature balance from the
poles to the equator.
第十二段
1 .Now, winds also help Earth maintain its balance in another way:
2 .by transporting water from one part of Earth to another.
3 .Water's contained in the air in the form of vapor,
4 .mostly through evaporation, mostly from the oceans.
5 .So when the air moves, it carries the vapor with it to some other parts of
Earth,
6 .where it can deposit it as rain or snow, or some other form of
precipitation.
第十三段
1 .Now, actually, the transfer of heat and water by way of the wind are very
closely related,
2 .because a primary way that heat energy is transferred by wind is
mediated by the process of evaporation.
3 .What happens is that a certain amount of heat energy is required to
convert liquid water into vapor.
4 .So when water evaporates from the ocean, it takes energy to convert
that water into a gaseous form, into water vapor.
5 .But that heat energy, that conversion energy, doesn't raise the
temperature of the water vapor or the air, it's just stored in the water vapor.
6 .Then later when the water vapor converts back to liquid water, that
energy is released.
第十四段
1 .So when water evaporates, energy is taken from the ocean, and it's
stored in the water vapor, in the air.
2 .Then the air, the wind, transports the water vapor to some other part of
Earth.
3 .Then the water vapor converts back into liquid water.
4 .It rains, in other words.
5 .And the heat energy that was stored in the water vapor is released into
the new environment.
6 .Okay? So the transfer of heat and the transfer of water are very closely
related.
7 .And what's the primary vehicle for this transfer?
8 .The wind! So wind is a very critical element in the redistribution of both
the Sun's energy and Earth's water.
TPO48
Conversation1
Listen to a conversation between a student and a university employee at
the campus employment office.
第二段
1 .Hi, can I help you?
第三段
1 .I hope so. My name's Mark Wickman. I'm...
第四段
1 .Don't I remember you from last year?
2 .You worked in, uh, where was it? The art library?
第五段
1 .Yeah, you're good. That was me, and I really enjoyed the work.
第六段
1 .Right, yeah. Your supervisor gave us some really great feedback at the
end of the year.
2 .Oh, "he's so organized, always on time, helpful..."
第七段
1 .Really, well.. I'm glad. It was a good job.
第八段
1 .Well, we usually try to match student's jobs with their academic interests.
第九段
1 .Yeah, urn, I'm not exactly sure what career I'm headed for. But librarian
is a possibility.
2 .It was a great experience to learn how it works and meet some people
working in the field. But for this year, well, that's what I wanted to ask
about.
第十段
1 .Oh, how come you waited so long to come in?
2 .You know how fast campus jobs fill up. If you'd come in earlier, you
could probably have gotten the library job again.
3 .I mean, since you have the experience from last year, you don't need the
training and all.
4 .But it's been filled now.
第十一段
1 .Yeah, I know.
2 .But I plan to get a job working at a restaurant off campus this year.
3 .I really need to make more money than I did last year, and working as a
waiter, there's always the tips.
4 .But I've tried a ton of places and I haven't found anything.
5 .I know it's really late, but, well, um, I was wondering if maybe there was
some job that hadn't been taken or maybe someone started a job,and you
know, had to drop it or something.
第十二段
1 .Well, I doubt you'll find anything.
第十三段
1 .Well, could you, could you possibly check?
2 .I know it's a long shot, but my friend Susanne, she takes photography
classes in Harrison Hall and...um...she sort of thought there might be an
opening in the janitorial staff.
第十四段
1 .Urn, why does your friend, the photography student, think she has
information about a janitorial staff opening?
2 .I'm pretty sure those jobs are filled. In fact, I remember taking lots of
applications for them, but let me double check it online.
第十五段
1 .She said the whole studio arts building and especially the photo lab have
been kind of, uh, sort of messy lately,
2 .I mean, she says there's...uh...chemicals and stuff left out, and you
know, it's like no one's been cleaning up.
3 .Oh, but that could just be, you know, students using the lab after hours
or something, like after it's been cleaned.
第十六段
1 .Hmm, hang on.
2 .There's a...There's...um...an asterisk gap next to one of the job numbers
here.
3 .There's a note.
4 .Let's see... Ha, your friend's right.
5 .Seems like one of the student janitors quit a couple of weeks ago for
some reason.
6 .Well, whatever, it looks like this is your lucky day.
第十七段
1 .Wow! That is so great.
2 .So who's the contact person?
第十八段
1 .Check with the janitorial office.
第一十九段
1 .Fine. Thanks so much.
Lecture1
Listen to part of a talk in an art history class.
第二段
1 .So today we are going to continue our discussion of 20th century
photography in the United States.
2 .Last time we were talking about Alfred Stieglitz and we saw that one of
his goals was to introduce Americans to European Art.
3 .Today, we are going to look at another photographer from the early 20th
century.
第三段
1 .Yes, Jennifer?
第四段
1 .Before we get to that, I had a question about Stieglitz.
第五段
1 .Sure.
第六段
1 .Well, Stieglitz was married to Georgia O'Keeffe. Right?
第七段
1 .That's right. Stieglitz was married to her, promoted her work and
actually, took some amazing portraits of her when they were married.
第八段
1 .For anyone who's not familiar with this,
2 .we are talking about the American painter: Georgia O'Keeffe.
第九段
1 .Ok. Well, I was wondering...Georgia O'Keeffe.
2 .You know I've heard her name so many times and I've seen some of her
work. But she's not mentioned in any of our reading about photographers
from that time.
第十段
1 .Oh. Well, O'Keeffe was really more of a painter.
第十一段
1 .I thought she was a photographer, too.
2 .I mean, I just saw one of her photographs in a museum the other day.
3 .I think it was called "Red Leaves on White" or something like that.
第十二段
1 .Oh, right! Yes. "Large Dark Reaves on White" is the complete title.
2 .It's a fairly well-known painting by O'Keeffe.
第十三段
1 .Oh, oh, okay. What was I thinking?
2 .I guess I should have had a closer look.
第十四段
1 .No, no. That's a really good observation.
2 .I mean chronologically that would be impossible.
3 .When she did that painting, color film hadn't even been invented yet.
4 .Neither had the right technology to blow pictures up that big to show that
much detail.
第十五段
1 .But that painting and some of her other paintings do reveal the...
2 .the influence of photography, like, uh, she would crop her images.
3 .She would make a frame around part of an image,
4 .say, just the very center and then cut off certain parts, the parts outside
that frame,
5 .to create the effect she wanted, the way a photographer does.
6 .And those paintings are close-ups,
7 .like you might see today, of a person or a flower in a photograph.
第十六段
1 .Now, those techniques were certainly around and being used by
photographers then.
2 .But just in photographs, which were smaller not as big as what O'Keeffe
was painting.
第十七段
1 .Also, O'Keeffe studied under an artist named Arthur Wesley Dow.
2 .That's DOW, D-O-W, who advocated focusing on simple basic forms,
like the lines of a flower and its petals and he wanted forms to be isolated
from their original settings.
第十八段
1 .He believed that, by doing that, an artist could reveal an object's, its
essence.
2 .He'd do things like...like...have students take a simple ordinary form, like
a leaf,
3 .and explore various ways of fitting all of it into a square,
4 .maybe bending it around to make the whole thing fit into the frame.
Pierre?
第一十九段
1 .It sounds like maybe O'Keeffe borrowed most of her ideas. The stuff we
might think of as being hers, she got them from other people.
2 .She didn't really have a style of her own.
第二十段
1 .Well, virtually, all artists are influenced by other artists,
2 .by their predecessors, by their contemporaries, their teachers...
第二十一段
1 .Artists build on what other artists have done.
2 .But if they are talented, they take it in some unique direction to develop
their own distinctive style.
第二十二段
1 .O'Keeffe liked to create abstract interpretations of real objects.
2 .In the painting Jennifer mentioned,
3 .Large Dark Red Leaves on White, in addition to exaggerating the size of
the leaf,
4 .O'Keeffe juxtaposes it against a silver or whitish background.
5 .So that's more of an abstract setting for it, and so on.
第二十三段
1 .Now, O'Keeffe wasn't the first artist to create an abstract interpretation of
a real object but she used that approach to express her experience of the
object she was painting.
2 .So she presented a vision that people hadn't seen before.
3 .It's unique.
4 .It's compelling.
5 .She didn't expect other people to experience the object the way she did.
6 .She knew they'd look at her painting and hang their own associations on
it, which is true for artwork in general, I think.
7 .That's just the way the human brain works. But at least they'd be taking
a careful look at something they'd never really paid much attention to.
Lecture2
Listen to part of the lecture in an Earth Science class.
2 .The class has been discussing volcanoes.
第二段
1 .Okay. We know the Earth's surface, the crust, is made up of tectonic
plates, and these huge slabs of rocky crust are slowly sliding over or under
or past each other,
2 .and we said that most of the world's volcanoes occur at the boundaries
of these tectonic plates where you have hot molten rock squeezing up
through gaps between the plates.
第三段
1 .But some volcanoes occur not at the edges, but in the middle of a
continental or oceanic plate.
2 .The Hawaiian Islands, for example,
3 .are thousands of kilometers away from any plate boundary, and yet you
have vast amounts of magma,
4 .molten rock or lava, flowing up through the earth's crust, which means,
of course,
5 .that volcanic activity there can't be explained simply by plate tectonics.
第四段
1 .So, how do we explain these volcanic anomalies, these exceptions to the
general rule?
第五段
1 .Well, back in 1963, a geophysicist by the name of Wilson came up with a
hot-spot theory to explain how this particular type of volcanic activity can
occur,
2 .and can go on for maybe tens or even hundreds of millions of years.
3 .Wilson's theory was that: hot spots exist below tectonic plates,
4 .and they're the cause of these volcanoes.
第六段
1 .But what causes the hot spots?
第七段
1 .Hmm, well, the most popular theory that's been proposed is the plume
hypothesis.
第八段
1 .According to this hypothesis, plumes, uh, basically columns of extremely
hot magma.
2 .These plumes well up from deep inside the planet's interior,
3 .maybe even as deep as its core,
4 .and rise all the way up to melt through the Earth's crust.
第九段
1 .Imagine a burning candle, and imagine moving a sheet of heavy paper
slowly over the flame of the candle.
2 .You're gonna get a series of burned spots in the paper,
3 .well, that's just like what's happening with the Hawaiian Islands, but
instead of a sheet of paper,
4 .you've got a tectonic plate,
5 .and it's moving over this plume of intensely hot magma,
6 .and rather than a series of burned spots in the paper.
7 .You're getting a chain of volcanic islands where the hot plume melts
through the crust under the Pacific Ocean at one point after another with
active volcanoes on the younger islands that are now just above the
plume,
8 .and the other islands, well, the farther away from the plume they are
now, the older they are, and the longer ago their volcanoes went dormant
or extinct.
第十段
1 .Incidentally, volcanic islands may seem small,
2 .but the island known as the Big Island Hawaii is one of the tallest
topographic features on the planet, more than five kilometers from the sea
floor to the ocean surface,
3 .and almost that much again, up to its highest peak.
4 .That's nearly ten kilometers from ocean floor to the highest point on the
island,
5 .which makes it taller even than Mount Everest.
第十一段
1 .So, you can imagine the huge amounts of magma, or lava, that've flowed
up to form even just this one island,
2 .much less the whole chain of islands.
第十二段
1 .Now, the Plume Hypothesis provides a pretty elegant explanation for a
volcanic anomaly, like the Hawaiian Islands.
2 .But, while it's hypothetically attractive,
3 .there's very little direct evidence to support the theory, because so far,
4 .no one's been able to actually observe what's happening that far
beneath the Earth's crust.
第十三段
1 .Some studies have been done, seismographic, geochemical,
2 .where the data's consistent with the model, but they aren't definitive
proof.
3 .Even the model supporters are uncomfortable claiming that it explains
every volcanic anomaly.
第十四段
1 .And like any popular theory, I suppose, it has some determined critics.
2 .These critics have put forth a number of alternative theories, all
unproven so far.
3 .But one well-regarded theory is the crack hypothesis,
4 .which assumes that hot spots are created when a piece of the crust gets
stretched thinner and thinner and the resulting stress causes small cracks
to open up at weak spots in the crust,
5 .and it's through these cracks that magma pushes up to form volcanoes.
第十五段
1 .Proponents of the crack hypothesis consider this a widespread
phenomenon and believe that magma's not coming up from deep within the
Earth's interior,
2 .but rather from just beneath the surface crust.
第十六段
1 .This hypothesis is attractive, because it fits with what we already know
about plate tectonics and it fits what we know about some secondary
smaller hot spots, but how well does it explain the Hawaiian Islands?
2 .Could a series of random cracks produce that same particular string of
Islands that's sequenced so neatly from old to young?
3 .You know, it worries me when a theory depends on coincidence to
produce results.
Conversation2
Listen to a conversation between a student and a professor.
第二段
1 .Hi professor, I was hoping to ask you a few questions about the class
you're teaching next semester,
2 .the course on Polish drama I was thinking of taking it.
第三段
1 .Well, that's an upper division course. You don't look familiar to me.
2 .Are you a student in this department?
第五段
1 .Ok, have you had other classes in the Slavic languages department,
here or somewhere else?
第六段
1 .No, that's the thing. I was just wondering how good my Polish would
have to be whether the class is taught Polish or not.
第七段
1 .Well, you'd have to have some knowledge of it.
2 .By that level a lot of students are quite fluent, plus there're some native
speakers in the department.
3 .And we don't plan for it to happen,
4 .but it's pretty common for the discussions to kind of move in and out of
English and Polish and it can be difficult to follow.
5 .So, how well do you speak Polish?
第八段
1 .Hmm, not so great.
2 .It's just that my father's from there.
3 .So I'm interested in learning about...
4 .You know, Polish history, Polish culture, plus I'm studying drama.
5 .I'll probably major in it.
6 .I love plays. So I thought your course might be perfect.
第九段
1 .Hmm, to be honest with you, you have to realize that we'll be watching
videos of performances.
2 .And maybe if we can swing it, even watch a live performance and those
won't necessarily be in translation.
3 .Also, texts, texts are sometimes available in translation. But even then
some references will be to the original.
4 .I'd hope you'd be fairly confident in reading.
第十一段
1 .You know what? I believe they'll be offering a survey course on Polish
literature.
2 .Let me check here.
3 .Yes, I thought it was being offered this time, Professor Jowaski's
teaching it.
4 .Let's see. It covers the major works,
5 .you know, epic romantic portray, the novels, and it does cover one or
two plays.
第十二段
1 .And this is in English?
第十三段
1 .Yes, you'll be reading mostly English translations and the discussions
will be in English.
第十四段
1 .Hmm, novels and poetry.
第十五段
1 .They'll provide you with a great historical context for the plays.
2 .So when you do get to them, you're gonna really have a feel for the
times they lived in, so to speak.
3 .Plus this course might also give you the impetus to learn more Polish,
you know, get it to the level where you'd be ready for the other class.
第十六段
1 .Hmm.
Lecture3
Listen to part of the lecture in a biology class.
第二段
1 .Ok, today I'd like to spend some time going into more detail about
symbiosis.
2 .Symbiosis, what is it? Anyone?
第三段
1 .Urn, I thought it's when two organisms are in a relationship that they
both benefit from.
2 .Well, at least that's what I thought it was until I did the reading last night.
3 .Now, I am kind of confused about it, because the book used that
definition to describe mutualism.
4 .Could you explain the difference?
第四段
1 .Good. I was hoping that someone would bring that up.
2 .Sometimes scientists working in different fields use the term symbiosis
to mean slightly different things.
3 .And it can get confusing.
4 .Uh, for example, when symbiosis is used as a synonym for mutualism.
5 .But there are quite a few of us out there who think there should be a
clearer distinction made between the two.
第五段
1 .Ok, where to begin...
2 .Um, the original definition of symbiosis is pretty simple.
3 .It simply means living together.
4 .So, any close relationship between two organisms of different species
would be considered a symbiotic relationship,
5 .including positive and negative relationships.
第六段
1 .Mutualism then is a kind of symbiosis,
2 .a specific type of symbiotic relationship where both organisms benefit
somehow.
3 .So, your book is correct.
第七段
1 .Now, I want to make it clear that, um, the positive result from being in a
mutualistic relationship doesn't have to be equal for both organisms.
2 .It's not a one-to-one ratio here.
第八段
1 .Is everyone with me so far?
2 .Symbiosis, general term;
3 .mutualism, a narrower or more specific kind of symbiosis. Okay.
第九段
1 .Now, let's take a closer look at mutualistic relationships.
2 .Um, I'll start off by describing a case of mutualism that involves a certain
butterfly species found in South Africa and Australia.
3 .It's a good example of how dependence on a mutualistic relationship can
vary.
第十段
1 .Ok, there's this butterfly family and I'll spare you the fancy Latin name
because it is not important for our purposes here.
2 .Uh, I'll call them Coppers and Blues, well, because most members of this
family have blue or copper colored wings.
3 .I think this is one of the most interesting cases of mutualism.
4 .These butterflies require the presence of ants to complete their life cycle.
5 .Their interaction with ants is obligatory.
第十一段
1 .So, this is what happens.
2 .A female butterfly of these Coppers and Blues will lay eggs only on
vegetation where there are ants of a particular species.
3 .The butterflies can smell,
4 .well, ants leave behind pheromones, a special chemical signal.
5 .The butterfly recognizes the ants' pheromones on the plant and then the
newly hatched butterflies, the caterpillars will feed on this plant after they
hatch from the eggs.
6 .As the caterpillar gets a little older and find shelter under nearby rocks or
stones to protect itself from predators.
7 .It's always attended or escorted by ants.
8 .And it always makes its way back to the host plant to feed,
9 .guided by the ants,
10 .the ant escort service, so to speak.
第十二段
1 .Now, why would the ants go through all this trouble?
2 .What's their benefit? Mary?
第十三段
1 .It's probably related to food?
第十四段
1 .Uh-huh? You are onto something.
第十五段
1 .Ok, ants feed on sweet stuff, right?
2 .So the caterpillar must have some kind of special access to honey or
sugars, or something like that.
3 .Maybe caterpillars produce honey somehow.
4 .On second thought, um, I'm probably way off.
第十六段
1 .You are pretty close actually.
2 .The caterpillars have a honey gland, an organ that secretes an amino
acid and carbohydrate liquid.
3 .The caterpillar secretes the liquid from the honey gland, rather large
quantities, enough to feed several ants.
第十七段
1 .But what makes this relationship obligatory for the caterpillar?
第十八段
1 .Well, if the ants don't feed regularly on the liquid from the caterpillar's
honey gland, the gland overloads and gets infected.
2 .The infection will kill the caterpillar and it will never reach its final stage
of development, becoming a butterfly.
第一十九段
1 .John?
第二十段
1 .Ok, I just want to make sure I'm following here.
2 .The caterpillar needs the ants or it won't make it to the stage where it
can become a butterfly.
3 .And the ants do this because they get an easy meal out of it, right?
4 .But the ants don't absolutely need the caterpillar for survival, 'cause they
can get food from other places right?
5 .So it's still called mutualism even though it seems like the caterpillar's
getting way more out of it.
6 .Oh, wait, you said they don't have to equally benefit. Never mind, sorry.
第二十一段
1 .Yes. But there is a type of mutualism where the relationship is necessary
for both organisms to survive.
2 .It's called obligatory mutualism.
3 .And we'll talk about that in the next class.
Lecture4
Listen to part of a lecture in an American History class.
第二段
1 .We have been talking about the transformation¡ªthe industrialization of
United States economy in 19th century.
2 .As the country shifted from an agricultural to an industrial base, political
power shifted too.
3 .Businesses became... a lot of power went...went...went...went from the
government into the hands of business leaders.
第三段
1 .So, why did this happen?
2 .How did an elite group, a few business giants,
3 .how did they end up dominating, controlling a number of important
national industries in the last quarter of the 19th century?
4 .How did they get to be so dominant?
5 .How did they figure out?
6 .How did they take advantage of the new industrialization of American
society?
第四段
1 .Well, consider the example of Andrew Carnegie and the steel industry.
第五段
1 .We have already discussed the development of a national network...a
national system of railroads.
2 .Well, this growth created a tremendous demand for steel.
3 .A national railroad system needs a lot of railroad tracks, right?
4 .And Carnegie seized the opportunity.
5 .He built the world's most modern steel mill.
6 .And he came up with a system of business organization called Vertical
Integration.
第六段
1 .Vertical Integration just means that...all...every single activity of a
particular industry's processing is performed by a single company.
2 .In the case of the steel industry, this means the mining of iron ore, the
transportation used to get ore from the mine to the mill, turning the ore into
the steel,
3 .the manufacturing process and sales. Carnegie controlled all of these.
4 .He practiced Vertical Integration on such a large scale that he practically
owned the whole steel industry.
5 .This, of course, gave him a lot of political clout.
6 .Just a quick sketch, but you get the idea, right?
第七段
1 .Here is another example: John D. Rockefeller. Rockefeller owned an oil
refinery, but he wanted to expand his business.
2 .Since there was lots of competition in the industry,
3 .he thought the smart way to go about it would be to buy his competitors'
businesses.
4 .But at the time it was illegal for one corporation to control another.
5 .So what he did was: he created an organizational structure called a trust.
6 .A trust is... well I don't have to go into that now.
第八段
1 .What matters is that a trust created a single, central management team.
2 .And that team directed the activities of what otherwise still appeared to
be independent companies.
3 .This new...uh...legal entity worked so well that at one point Rockefeller
controlled 90% of the country's oil refineries,
4 .which again gave him lots of political power.
第九段
1 .So you've got two different approaches to expanding a business, and
both were quite effective.
2 .Of course, these weren't the only two examples.
3 .A number of big businesses run by powerful individuals developed
across a wide range of industries, like railroads, food processing,
electricity.
4 .But what they all had in common was: the government let them operate
pretty much how they wanted to.
第十段
1 .So why did they do that?
2 .Why did the government keep such a low profile and allow individuals to
gain so much control of the industries?
3 .Well, obviously, they had the wealth and the power to influence political
leaders.
第十一段
1 .But also, the truth is that these industry leaders made a significant
contribution.
2 .Their investments in technologies led to the development of many new
production techniques, which strengthened the economy.
3 .And many of them gave lots of money to charity.
4 .Andrew Carnegie was particularly admired for his generosity.
第十二段
1 .But there was one thing in particular that gave them power.
2 .And that's they were beneficiaries,
3 .probably the biggest beneficiaries of a theory,
4 .a dominant political theory in the 19th century, something called laissezfaire doctrine.
第十三段
1 .Laissez-faire roughly means "let it alone".
2 .And that pretty much summarized the theory's philosophy.
3 .The idea was that government should leave business alone, allow it to
operate unregulated.
4 .Legislators weren't supposed to pass a lot of laws, or worry about
regulating business practices.
5 .When people did challenge a company's business conduct,
6 .I mean, I mean, in court cases, well, the few laws that did exist were
usually interpreted in favor of business interests.
第十四段
1 .But over time, it started becoming increasingly obvious and troubling to
the public that some of these big companies simply had too much control.
2 .There were criticisms that owners had too much opportunity to exploit
workers,
3 .workers and consumers, because they could control prices and wages.
4 .And small business owners and small farmers couldn't compete.
第十五段
1 .So there was bad press, bad publicity, enough that the government
eventually felt it had to do something.
2 .So it passed two key pieces of legislation.
3 .One law was designed to regulate the prices set by the railroads;
4 .another made it illegal for trusts to be used to limit competition.
5 .Both were aimed squarely at reducing the exclusive control that existed
in some industries.

TPO 49-Conversion 1 (Restricted Access)
Listen to a conversation between a student and a librarian.
Student: Hi, I need to get into special collections, in particular the British Literature.I was working with some of the
William Blake books.
Librarian: Well, then you must know that access is restricted.
Student: Um, I was in a seminar with Professor Gray and she authorized access for us.
Librarian: Oh, if that's the case, let me check.Right. Yeah. But it looks like that expired at the end of last semester
Student: But I really need to get back in there.See...I didn't quite finish my project.
Librarian: Aha! The plot thickens.Well, it's easy enough.Have Professor Gray authorize you again.You see, these
editions are rare and shouldn't be handled more than necessary.Can you work from later editions or microfilm?
Student: Not really. Actually my project...Well, it involves some annotations in the particular edition here.They
haven't been reproduced because they are really not part of the text.You know, they generally clean them up.They
are quite hard to see.
Librarian: Well, often the characteristics of the manuscripts have been recorded.These types of extraneous markings
might also be noted.
Student: I don't think they are.They are very faint, and, well, I think I have a new angle on them.There was a study
once a long time ago about these notes that everybody else has taken for granted without checking for themselves.I
think there might have been a mistake in the past, that they were misread.
Librarian: So get Professor Gray...
Student: Uh...she's away this semester I had to beg her to give me extra time on this project.I haven't even received a
grade in the class yet.And this class is a prerequisite for other classes in my major.I really need to see those books so
I can finish this project and get back on course to graduate on time.
Librarian: Everybody has special circumstances.
Student: Two hours? One hour?I promise to be careful.I just need to look at a few pages with a strong magnifying
glass.
Librarian: Well, I can‟t let you in without authorization from your professor.Can you get in touch with her
somehow?
Student: Maybe she'd be checking her email.I really thought I would be able to straighten this out without her.You
know, she did me a huge favor by giving me the extra time.I feel like I'm skating on thin ice with her.
Librarian: You know, you were lucky to have had permission to look at the books last semester.If we don't maintain
our policies, they'll disintegrate.
Student: I know. Would an email from her or a phone call be good enough?
Librarian: Of course.

TPO 49-Lecture 1 (Alaska)
Listen to part of a lecture in a geology class.
Professor: Alaska is fascinating to geologists because of its incredible landscapes.Permafrost has a lot to do with this.That is the
areas where the ground, the soil, is always frozen, except for the very top layer, what we call the active layer of permafr ost,
which melts in the summer and refreezes again in the winter.
The northern part of Alaska is covered in lakes, thousands of them.And most of these are what we call thaw lakes, T -H-A-W,
thaw lakes.I'm going to show you a few sketches of them in a minute, so you'll have a good idea of what I'm talking about.So
how these thaw lakes are formed has to do with...OK, it starts with ice wedges.The top part of the ice wedge melts.Should I
back up?
Ice wedges form when water runs into cracks in the ground, the permafrost, then freezes.You ever see mud after it dries?Dried
mud has cracks because when it dries it contracts, it shrinks.
Well, in winter permafrost behaves similarly.It shrinks in winter because it freezes even more thoroughly then.And as it shrinks,
it forms deep, deep cracks.Then in the summer, when the active layer, the top layer of the permafrost, melts, the melt water runs
into those cracks in the permafrost, then freezes again, because that ground, the ground beneath the active layer is still below
freezing.So you have wedges of ice in the permafrost.
Now, the ice wedges widen the original cracks in the permafrost because water expands when it freezes.All right, OK.Then in
the autumn, the active layer on top freezes again.Then in winter the permafrost starts contracting again and the cracks open up
even wider.So the next summer when the active layer melts again and flows into the widened cracks and freezes, it makes the
cracks even wider.So it's sort of a cycle through which the cracks and the wedges grow wider and wider.
So when the ice wedge reaches a certain size, its top part in the active layer turns into a little pond when it melts in the
summer.And that's the beginning of your thaw lake.There are thousands of them in Northern Alaska.One of the most fascinating
things about these lakes and this is important, is that they mostly have the same shape like an elongated oval or egg shape, and
what's more, all the ovals are oriented in the same way.Here is an idea of what they look like, what the landscape looks like
from an aerial view with the lakes side by side.
There's been considerable research done to try to figure out what causes them to be shaped and oriented this way.We know that
the shape and orientation are caused by the way the lakes grow once they are formed.But the question is what makes them grow
this way?
One theory sees winds as the cause.This region of Alaska has strong winds that blow perpendicular to the lakes.What happe ns is
wind blows straight into the longer side of the lakes.
Now, wouldn't that erode the lake bank in that direction?Same direction as the wind?Well, no.Actually, what happens is that t he
waves caused by the winds build a sort of protective layer of sediment.It's called a protective shelf, along the bank of the lake
directly in front of them.So that bank is shielded from erosion and the waves are diverted to the sides, to the left and to t he
right.And that's why the left and the right banks start eroding.
Get it? The bank straight ahead is protected. But the lake currents, the waves erode the banks to the sides. That's the current
model, the wind erosion model, which is generally accepted.
But there is a new theory that says that thaw slumping, not wind, is what shapes the thaw lakes.
Thaw slumping... Ok. Sometimes in the summer the temperature rises pretty quickly. So the active layer of permafrost thaws
faster than the water can drain from the soil. So the sides of the thaw lakes get like mushy and slump or slide into the lake. Then
the lake water spreads out more and the lake gets bigger. OK?
Also in that part of Alaska, the terrain is gently sloped, so the lakes are all on an incline. Here, now, this is an exaggeration of
the angle. The hill is not this steep. But see how with the lake's banks, the side that is farther downhill, it's smaller, lower. This
short bank thaws faster than the tall one does, so it falls into the lake, it slumps much more and much faster than the other
bank. When short banks of many lakes slump, they move farther downhill and the lakes grow all in the same downhill direction.
This is a new theory, so it hasn't been tested much yet. In field studies, when we've looked at the banks of these thaw lakes,
there is not much evidence of slumping. We‟d expect to see cliff-like formation there from the slumping. But we haven‟t really
found any of those.

TPO 49-Lecture 2 (Montessori Method)
Listen to part of a lecture in an education class.The professor is discussing the Italian educator Maria Montessori.
Professor: Ok, if you did your reading for today, then you were introduced to a very influential alternative to traditional
education.This educational philosophy and methodology was pioneered in Italy in the early 1900s by Doctor Maria
Montessori.It's called the Montessori Method.But what made the Montessori Method for young children so
different?What made it so different, so special?
Male Student: It's based on very different ideas about how kids learn best, right?
Professor: Um-hmm...It was groundbreaking.To begin with, unlike the traditional classrooms at the time, the Montessori
classroom environment was more suited to the child.The furniture was child-sized.Well, it's that way in almost all schools
now, but that wasn't always the case.
We can thank Montessori for this.You won't see any long benches with children in rows or heavy desks that separate
children.Children are free to interact with each other.And in Montessori classrooms, the furniture is lightweight, so
children can move it around easily, and having furniture and materials made to fit them, makes kids feel more
competent.This fits in with Montessori's notion of liberty and autonomy.Children are free to move around the room and
they learn to do things for themselves.
Male Student: I'm not sure I get that part.It sounds like potential chaos.
Professor: Oh, no, no, no.Let's not confuse this liberty of activity with lack of discipline.In fact, teachers have to mainta in
this specific environment carefully through a number of rules, which are generally about respect and what's right.It's just
that the child needs freedom of choice to develop independence and self-direction.
Also, unlike what happens in most conventional classrooms, children choose their own activities.They may be guided by
the teacher, but it's ultimately up to each child to select tasks, which brings us to the manipulative equipment you find in a
Montessori classroom, like little boards that have rough or smooth surfaces, or blocks that can be stacked into a
tower.Now this equipment was designed by Montessori over time with much experimentation, designed...well, designed
to help children teach themselves through playing.
Female Student: Well, what do the teachers do?I mean if the kids are teaching themselves.
Professor: Ah, well, that's a good question.To start, a child may not work with an activity until the teacher has
demonstrated its proper use.Then the Montessori teacher's job is to observe the child's play, because when the children
play, they are acquiring the bases for later concepts.So the teacher helps motivate and focus each child and monitors the
child's progress, but does not interfere with the child's observations and deductions.That was and still is a nov el idea, and
for many teachers not the easiest thing to do.In facts, for some, it‟s very difficult.Montessori herself called the teacher a
director.Remember, the independence of the learner lies at the heart of the Montessori methodology.
Female Student: Ok, yeah, it does seem like that the teacher need a lot of training and patience.
Professor: True.As I said, it is not easy for a lot of teachers to step back like that, but getting back to the equipment.Basic
Montessori equipment can be divided into a number of major subject areas such as practical life, mathematics and what is
called sensorial.
With a sensorial equipment, the children can explore things like sounds and textures.At the same time, they develop motor
skills.But this apparent play is laying the groundwork for the later math and language work.
Now let's take a look at the materials called brown stairs.For a young child playing with this graduated blocks, these
brown stairs, they are not just a sensorial lesson.By manipulating them, the child develops fine motor skills and by sorting
and classifying them by size, by weight, the child learns some basic mathematics.Similarly, with practical-life equipment,
the child can learn how to button a shirt, cut up an apple for a snack and other real-world tasks.
Male Student: Without this integration in real-world learning, is there any room for creativity?
Professor: Is creativity encouraged?Well, lots of Montessori teachers wouldn‟t praise a child for using a violin as a
baseball bat or for putting their head like a hat.But actually, creativity comes through learning to play the violin, using the
object for the purpose that was intended and practical life exercises stress that.

Professor: Oh, hi, Melanie, how are you doing?
Student: I'm good. Thanks. I just have some questions about this paper for your class. Do you have a second to talk about it now?
Professor: Oh, yes. No problem. I have about twenty minutes before my next class. Will that be enough time?
Student: Yeah. I think so. Okay. So the thing is, you know, okay, I'm writing my paper on the history of jazz in New York City.
Professor: All right. Well, that's a pretty broad subject.
Student: Well, actually I'm focusing on a specific decade, the 50s and on...and I'm only doing it on a few specific artists.
Professor: Oh, okay, because I was going to say that seemed a bit, uh, too ambitious for a ten-page paper.
Student: Yeah, no, it's not the subject I'm having trouble with.Actually the paper is practically writing itself.I mean, I have got a lot to
say and it's going pretty well.The thing is, I have this idea that might make it better and I was wondering if there's any wa y I could get
an extension.I mean, I know it's due next week. Right?
Professor: That's right, on Monday. But I don't understand.It sounds like you are doing so well. Why do you need more time?
Student: Yeah. Well, I could write the paper as it is and turn it in on time and it would be fine.
Professor: But?
Student: But I was just talking to one of my friends whose family has lived in New York forever!And it turns out that her gra ndfather
was actually there, in the period of jazz I'm writing about.I mean, he was a jazz musician and he actually, like personally, knew the
artists I'm writing about.
Professor: You are kidding!That's a coincidence.
Student: Yeah, I know, it's cool, right?So anyway, that's why I was wondering if I could get an extension because I thought it would
be really great if I could like interview him for my paper.
Professor: Ah...
Student: But I don't think I can meet with him until early next week. So...
Professor: Ah, I see.Well. It would certainly add a new dimension to your paper, wouldn't it?Have you talked to this gentleman yet?
Student: Uh, no, but I talked to my friend, just, you know, ran the idea past her and she said he would probably love to do i t.But you
know, he is busy until next week.

TPO 49-Lecture 4 (Pottery)
Listen to part of a lecture in an archaeology class.
Professor: So if I ask you what most archaeologists do with all those pieces of broken pottery they find at the
excavation sites, you'd probably say that they help establish the time period of the site. Pretty obvious. Huh? Pottery
helps us order things in time to assign relative dates.Basically, when we date pottery, we look at its frequency at a
given site.
As you can probably surmise, styles of pottery vary over time, in terms of how they're made, what they're made of
and what they were used for.So as archaeologists, we built up a picture, a sequence of how pottery changed over
time as well as how its popularity varied over time which we can tell by the frequency of a style at a site, how many
occurrences we find at a given site.But pottery can provide evidence about a lot of things, not just dating evidence,
not just evidence of the time period that pottery was created.So there is also another type of evidence that we call
distributional evidence.OK, pottery is evidence of distribution.It, pottery, provides evidence that trade took
place.Pots were traded for themselves or given as gifts, but even more often they changed hands cause they were
used as containers for food or wine.
To fully understand how pottery's used as distributional evidence, we have to know its origin, where it was made.So
how do we figure this out? Well, by studying what the pottery's made of, you look at the material that...that a pot's
made of, to know where it was made and its distribution.
OK. A third kind of evidence is evidence of function, the function of the site where the pottery was found and
sometimes about the lives of the people who lived there.Now this evidence is a bit tougher to interpret than the other
two.And there are several reasons for this.
First of all, pottery is usually not found in primary contexts, that is, it's often not found in the plac e where it was
used.Think about you average town dump, you know the place where everyone's unwanted stuff ends up, can you
imagine archaeologists a thousand years from now digging up a town dump and then using the items found there to
get meaningful information about how the objects found there were used? Probably not.
A second reason why function is harder to identify is that not all objects found in one spot can be assumed to have
identical functions even if they look similar.If you come across a collection of pots at a site, you need to work at the
level of the group rather than the individual pots because you can't assume that they all have the same function just
because they were found in the same place.So this is where pottery's form comes into play.
The form of a pot can give us some ideas about its function, the suitability of the pottery to serve a specific
function.However, we have to be careful when it comes to skeuomorphs.These objects are copies of the designs of
other objects, but in another material.And this can be problematic, because sometimes the new or different material
is not well suited to the design.
A good example of this comes from a fifteen-century Dutch ceramics, a bronze cauldron was copied in ceramic,
including the sort of big angled handles, and while it worked well in bronze, it didn‟t work in the ceramic
skeuomorph. Well, because the ceramic handles couldn‟t support the weight of the pot when it‟s full, it just couldn‟t
function as it was intended to.

TPO 50-Conversion 1 (Straw Poll)
Listen to a conversation between a student and a political science professor.
Student:I‟m not sure if you know but I would like to go to the student government this year.
Teacher: Oh, congratulations! I was in student government myself as an undergraduate. It taught me a lot about the
political process. In fact, the experience solved my problem of what to do with my life. It really cemented my
interest in becoming a political scientist.
Student: Cool! Anyway, the reason I came by is we are getting ready to conduct a straw poll on campus, you know,
hold an informal ballot since the general election is just a couple of months away. We want to get a field from the
students' bodies political leanings, like who students are planning to vote for, which political party people identify
with, that sort of thing.
Teacher: I‟m sure. I help students run the straw poll once years ago, uh, it was a lot of work. Mostly because we use
paper ballots, and stayed up all night counting them. But if you use computers……
Student: Yeah, we are creating a website for our students to be able to vote online. Em, we are looking for a faculty
advisor to help, actually. I was hoping you might be interested.
Teacher: Oh, I‟m flattered, John. But my schedule is so jammed. I‟m teaching two seminars, your intro-course,
finishing up my research. But, what about Professor Clan? She is new in our department. Plus, she is a wiz with
computers.
Student: Ok, I will ask her.
Teacher: So, have you decided on the topic for your term paper yet?
Student: Not really.
Teacher: Why not write about your straw poll? Since the paper is not due till after the election, you could include
your results. Maybe compare them with the real election results.
Student: But would that be enough? I mean, just comparing numbers?
Teacher: Well, no, you need to provide some analysis, too. But I was thinking, there is a couple of local ballot
questions this year. You know, referenda, the voters can either support or not support?
Student: Right. There is one on whether to ban smoking in restaurants, and another one……I think is whether to
spend tax dollars for a new sports arena in the city.
Teacher: Ah, Ok. Here is an idea. In regular elections, the vast majority of voters ignore referenda. They vote for
their favorite candidates but avoid ballot questions. We believe it's because voters aren‟t familiar with the questions
or don‟t understand them. But actively educating people on ballot questions right before they vote can improve
referendum participation rates.
Student: In that case, maybe we could have our straw poll website providing information on the ballot questions, like
how each proposal would affect students.
Teacher: Exactly. And when you write your paper, you could compare the students‟ referendum voting rate to the
general publics. And include you own analysis of the results. Plus, there is plenty of publish research on referendum
voting behavior.
Student: Thanks, Professor Miller. I have no idea the straw poll can actually help me in my course work.

TPO 50-Lecture 1 (Ancient Egyptian Glass)
Listen to part of a lecture in an ancient history class.
Professor: Ok, last time we were discussing trade and commerce during the Bronze Age. And I said a little over
three thousand years ago, there was quite a lively trade among the countries along the Mediterranean Sea. People are
making objects out of bronzes and they were using bronze tools to make other goods. And they develop trade
networks to trade these goods with other countries around the Mediterranean. One of the things they traded was
glass. And recently there was an archeological excavation in Egypt, on the Nile River around where enters the
Mediterranean Sea where they discovered an ancient glass factory. Robert?
Robert: I thought our textbook said the Egyptians imported their glass from other countries.
Professor: Well, until now that‟s what the evidence seemed to suggest. I mean, we have some evidence that
suggested that the Egyptians were making glass objects, but not glass.
Robert: Ok. Am……Am I missing something? They are making glass but they are not making glass?
Professor: I said they were making glass objects, right? You see, it was previously thought that they weren‟t actually
making the raw glass itself that they were importing unfinished glass from Mesopotamia, which today is a region
consisting of Iraq and parts of Syria and Turkey and Iran, and simply reworking it. Most archeologists believed that
the glass factories were in Mesopotamia because that‟s where the oldest known glass remains come from. You see,
there was two stages of glass making. The primary production stage where they made disks of raw glass. And there
was the secondary stage where they melted the raw glass, the glass disks, and created decorative objects, so, or
whatever. And from this new Egyptians‟ site, we learned that the primary production stage had several steps. First
they took quartz, a colorless transparent mineral and crushed it. Then they took that crushed quartz and mixed it with
plant ash. A plant ash is just what it sounds like, the ashes left after you burnt plant material. They slowly heated this
mixture at a relatively low temperature in small vessels, containers like jars made out of clay. And that yielded a
kind of glassy material. They took this glassy material and grounded it up into a powder and then they used metallic
dye to color it. After that, they poured the colored powder out into disk-shaped molds and heated it up to very high
temperatures. So that it melted. After cooled, they break the molds, and inside there were the glass disks. These
disks were shipped out to other sites within Egypt and places around the Mediterranean. Then in the secondary
phase, the disks were reheated, and shaped into decorative objects. Susan?
Susan: So what kind of objects were people making back then?
Professor: Well, the most common objects we found, mostly in Egypt and Mesopotamia, the most common objects
were beads. One thing the Egyptian were very very good at was imitating precious stones. They created some beads
that look so much like emeralds and pearls that was very difficult to distinguish them from the real thing. Em,
and……and also beautiful vessels, ah, with narrow necks. They were probably really valuable so they wouldn‟t have
been used to hold cooking oil or common food items. They were most likely used for expensive liquids, like
perfume. Now the glass made at this factory was mostly red, to get this red color they used copper, in a sophisticated
process. Of course, any kind of glass was very valuable so these red bottles would only have been owned by wealthy
people. In fact, because it was so difficult to make, and sort of mysterious and complicated, it was probably a
product produced for the royal family. And they probably used glass to show their power. Also, beautiful expensive
objects made great gifts if you are looking to establish or strength the political alliances. And it is quite possible that
the ancient Egyptians were actually exporting glass, not just making it or importing it. The trade with Mesopotamia
was probably a friendly mutual trade because a Mesopotamia glass was usually white or yellow. So Mesopotamians
might accept something like, we will give you two white disks for two red disks. There is no proof of that, at least
not yet.

TPO 50-Lecture 2 (The Classification of Creatures)
Listen to part of a lecture in a biology class.
Processor: Ok. There are two major types of classifiers in the world, people we call lumpers and people we call
splitters. A lumper is someone who tries to put as many things as possible in one category. Splitters like to work for
the differences and put things in as many different categories as possible.
Both lumpers and splitters work in the business of defining biological classifications. The great philosopher
Aristotle is generally considered the first person to systematically categorize things. He divided all living things into
two groups. They were either animal or vegetable. And these categories are what biologists came to call
“kingdoms”. So if it ran around, it was an animal, a member of the animal kingdom. And if it stood still, and grew in
the soil, it was a plant, a member of the plant kingdom. This system, organizing all life into these two kingdoms,
worked very well for quite a while, even into the age of the microscope.
With the invention of the microscope, in the late 1500s, we discovered the first microorganisms. We thought that
some wiggled and moved around and others were green and just sat there. So the ones that moved like animals were
classified as animals, and the more plant-like ones as plants.Oh, before I go on I must mention Carolus Linnaeus. A
hundred years or so after the invention of the microscope, Carolus Linnaeus devised a simple and practical system
for classifying living things, according to the ranks of categorization still in use today——class, order, family and so
on.
And by further best aspect of the Linnaeus system, is the general use of binomial nomenclature, having just two
names to describe any living organism. This replaced the use of long descriptive names, as well as common names
which vary from place to place and language to language.Binomial nomenclature gives every species a unique and
stable two-word name, agreed upon by biologists worldwide.
But not everything about this system remained unchanged. Take for example the mushroom, a fungus. It grew up
from the ground and looked like a plant. So it was classified as a plant. But using the microscope we discovered that
a fungus contains these microscopic thread-like cells that run all over the place. And so it‟s actually not that plantlike. So in this case, the splitters eventually won, and got a third kingdom just for the fungus.
And as microscopes improved, we discovered some microorganisms that were incredibly small. I‟m talking about
bacteria. And we could see that they didn‟t have what we call a nucleus. So they got their own kingdom, a kingdom
of very tiny things without nucleoli. So then we had several kingdoms for plants and for animals, and the different
kinds of fungus like mushrooms, and for these tiny bacteria. But we also had some other microorganisms that didn‟t
fit anywhere. So biologist gave them their own kingdom. And this fifth kingdom was sort of anything that doesn‟t fit
in the first four kingdom, which upset some people.
And then there was a question of viruses. Viruses have some characteristics of life but don‟t reproduce on their own
or use energy. So we still don‟t know what to do with them. The lumpers want to keep viruses in the current
system. Some of the splitters say to give them a separate kingdom.And the extreme splitters say that viruses have
nothing at all to do with living things and keep them out of my department.
Recent research though has moved to see yet another direction. Nowadays when we want to determine the
characteristics of something, we look at its biochemistry and its genetic material.[4:00.22] And what we‟ve
discovered is that some bacteria are not like the others. Many of these are called extremophiles. They live in very
strange places, in polar ice or in a boiling water of hot springs or in water so salty (that) other organisms couldn‟t
live there. Extremophiles tend to have a different chemistry from other bacteria, a chemistry that in some case is
actually more related to plants and animals than to previously known bacteria. So what to do with this strange
bacteria?
Well, one thing we‟ve done is creating a new set of categories, the domains, overarching the different
kingdoms. Biologists now recognize three domains. But even as we talk about these new domains, well, come back
in a few years and it might all be different.

TPO 50-Conversion 2 (Disturbance from Library Maintenance)
Listen to a conversation between a student and the head of building maintenance.
Teacher: Can I help you?
Student: Yeah, I um……I‟m taking summer classes right now and they put me in Robert‟s Dormitory, offered by the
library.
Teacher: Ok.
Student: And I guess they are painting the library or doing something to the outside of the building?
Teacher: Ah……yes, they are. They are replacing the bricks on the outside walls.
Student: Well, whatever it is, it‟s like……really disturbing, for those of us with windows facing the library. They are
working on the wall right opposite us. I mean, dust is everywhere coming in the windows, and, the noise, cos we are
like…… what, ten feet away. And……well, it is just not a pretty picture.
Teacher: Right, well, that‟s why we waited until now to start work on it. I mean, most students have already left campus
for summer vacation.
Student: Yeah, but Robert‟s Hall has been used by all the summer students.
Teacher: Really? The housing didn‟t notify us of that.
Student: Yeah. It‟s pretty full. I mean, I can‟t sleep at night, because of the smell and the dust and……You know, I‟d love
to just like close the windows but you know (it‟s) being summer now.
Teacher: Yes, I know. There is no air-conditioning in that building.
Student: Right! So I mean, we got five more weeks of classes left, and we were really wondering how much longer they
are going to be working on that particular wall. Because maybe it‟s going to be a while.Do you think they could maybe
work on a different side of the building for now, one that's not facing people‟s dorm rooms, and wait until the students are
gone? To come back and finish this side? I mean, that way the dust and noise won‟t be coming directly into our windows
while we are here.
Teacher: You know, I wish it weren‟t being done this way and it doesn‟t make sense. But……this particular decision was
made by a special committee and their plan was finalized several months ago. They just didn‟t realize there would be
students in Robert‟s Hall now.
Student: Yeah.
Teacher: Plus, well, the equipment is all set up, you know, the scaffolding is up on that side of the building and……oh it
just won‟t be practical to have the construction workers move everything to another side and leave a whole side of the
library all torn out like that.
Student: I guess not. Isn‟t there another dorm open anywhere?
Teacher: Not that I know. Oh, wait. I overheard someone saying today that Manchester Hall isn‟t being used by the city‟s
summer camp after all. You know, most years they house their participants in that dorm all summer.
Student: Well, there is an idea.
Teacher: Now it‟s a smaller dorm and it‟s a little out of the way but……well, I bet……I bet they could move the affected
student from Robert‟s Hall.
Student: Wow, I think a lot of people would definitely appreciate that.
Teacher: Ok, well, let me call the housing people and I will get back to you. Leave your name and number, ok? And I will
let you know what I find out.
Student: Great. Thanks.

TPO 50-Lecture 3 (American Realism)
Listen to part of a lecture in the United States‟ Literature class. The professor is discussing Realism.
Professor: Ok, everyone. In our last class, we finished up Romanticism, right? So now let‟s look at something completely
different. Realism as a literary technic was most popular in U.S. literature from around 1860 till 1890. So it started pretty
much around the time of the civil war. And I think you‟ll see right away how it is different from Romanticism or any
other kind of literature. There is a very specific point that makes it unique. And that is that it shows people as they are and
get you to look at them and also you know the things that need to be changed in the society. And it doesn‟t without being
sentimental, not in that sort of over-emotional way, the way that romantic literature can. Realism tells it like it is.
Let‟s look society as a whole. In the late 1800s, people were interested in the scientific method as well as rational
philosophy, which says that people can discover the truth by using reason and factual analysis. So reason and facts,
ok. And at the same time that realism was becoming popular, there were a lot of political and socioeconomic changes
happening in the country. There was increased literacy, plus the growth of industrialism and urbanization, growth in
population from immigration, and a rise in middle class affluence.
All these factors combined with the importance of reason and facts, meant readers were interested in really having a good
understanding of all these changes, the changes going on in society. A scourer named Amy Chaplin says, and I‟m just
paraphrasing here, that Realism is a way to understand and deal with social change, which makes a lot of sense I think.
So then, let‟s take a closer look at the trips of the trend, and how realist writers did their work. For one thing as we said,
they focus on, express reality, and in great detail.They inferred verisimilitude. Shall I write down on board?
Students: Um-hum.
Professor: Ok. Verisimilitude means basically the same true or real, like say, a photograph rather than a painting in a
way. In fact, that‟s a good analogy. You see writers try to capture a moment in time and all its basic facts but without
exaggeration, just like a camera does.
Anyway, the events, the things that happen in realistic literature are usually pretty much plausible. I mean, you figure that
they can probably happen to anyone. And the characters are believable, too. And actually, they are usually even more
important than the plot. There‟re also……they talked the way the real people talk, authentic speaking styles from
different regions, different parts of the country were captured in the text. Does that make sense? Ok.
So, besides verisimilitude, another important characteristic of realism is the narrator‟s objectivity. Characters in the events
were described without the narrator passing much judgment on them or anything or being too dramatic. Basically, you are
reading a story without too much extra comment from the narrator.
Ok, now we have an idea of what realism was. So, who were the players? Well, two important realist novelists were
Rebecca Harding Davis and Mark Twain. We‟ll talk more about other realists tomorrow. But for today, let‟s just start by
looking briefly at these two.
Rebecca Harding Davis was an author and journalist who, like other realists, was concerned about all those social changes
going on. She wrote mainly about some marginalized groups of the time, like women, native Americans, ah,
immigrants. Now her best known book is a novella called The Life in the Iron Mills. It‟s really a key text, because it‟s one
of the original realist works. Her works overall have been pretty much ignored for a long time. But some critics and
scourers are starting to revisit them and study them more seriously. Probably more from the historical aspects of the
works and……but I think that‟s great.
But if we are talking about great literature, literature that‟s read and enjoyed today as something more than just a way of
looking at that era, the era when that was written. Well, a favorite of mine is Mark Twain. I‟m sure you have read or heard
of his most famous book, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. And Twain‟s style, he goes back to what I said earlier,
verisimilitude, the realistic way characters act and talk. You should realize too that this was quite a contrast to earlier
writers in the U.S., who try to emulate the British writers, try to be very elegant, at the expense of Realism. You know, a
lot of critics will tell you that American literature began with that book, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.

TPO 50-Lecture 4 (Petroleum)
Listen to part of a lecture in a geology class.
Professor: Hi, class, let‟s get started. Um, last time we finished up the section of coal, so we have just two fossil
fuels left to talk about. Those are petroleum and natural gas. Today I will concentrate on petroleum and we will get
into natural gas tomorrow. Like coal and natural gas, petroleum has been formed over millions of years, from
remains of prehistoric plants and animals.
And like coal and natural gas, it‟s found in the rocks of Earth‟s crusts. In fact, the word “petroleum” literally means
“rock oil”. And in its‟ original state, the way we find it in Earth‟s crust, it is called crude oil, sometime people will
short it up, and just refer to it as crude.
Um, petroleum also contains natural gas, so usually the petroleum industry is naturally searching for and utilizing
deposits of both crude oil and natural gas at the same time. In other words, companies might as well gather, use and
sell both the oil and the gas when they find it, since both are valuable. And……
Student: But what kind of organic materials, I mean, specifically what kind of dead plant and animals make up
petroleum exactly? Do you mean like trees and dinosaurs?
Professor: Well, apparently petroleum is usually made from simple, one-celled marine animals and plants, algae, for
example. Um, what happens is this accumulated plant and animal material that originally came from the ocean gets
covered by sediment. And then is…um, eventually exposed to earth internal heat and pressure, for millions of
years. And over those millions of years, the heat cooks and the pressure molds that material, turning it into a thick,
sticky liquid. And since petroleum is made from these ocean organisms, you can guess where it was found, it makes
sense that we usually find it under the ocean or near shore, right? Yes, Ann?
Ann: I‟ve heard people talk of……ah……live and dead oils?
Professor: Well, um, when crude oil has a lot of natural gas mixed up with it, it‟s called live oil. But if the gas
escapes from the mixture, then oil is said to be dead. And it‟s heavy and more difficult to pump. Does anyone know
how the gas separates from the oil? Sam, go ahead.
Sam: Doesn‟t it happen when the oil shoots up to the surface?
Professor: Yes, that‟s right. When oil reaches the surface of the Earth, there is less pressure on it. And with less
pressure, the oil and gas were able to separate. The other way the crude oil was able to come up to the surface is by
people pumping it up out of the ground. And, um, it‟s the same thing that happens at the surface, there is less
pressure, and, so the oil and gas separate. But when we talked about how would actually exists inside earth‟s crust,
most people think that there are huge, pools of oil sitting around in caverns somewhere under there. That‟s really
rare. The majority of petroleum is just filling in the tiny pores and cracks in rocks.
Now, um, a little more on the petroleum industry. As far as the extraction process the petroleum industry digs deep
wells to reach underground oil fields where crude oil has accumulated over a large area and extract between layers
of rocks. Then it pumps the crude oil out. Then its refineries have two main tasks, convert less valuable crude oil
into a more valuable form and create usable products from refined oil. Basically, the refiner will do this by boiling
the oil. When the oil cools off, the stuff that is left is turned into a variety of products, like gasoline, diesel fuel for
cars and trucks, asphalt for roads, um, paints, plastics, even soaps. And check what you‟re wearing, if you are
wearing something with synthetic fibers, what that really means is that it is made of the petroleum. So you can see
petroleum is essential to today‟s industrial society.
Now, next week we will be joined the graduate students from the department of petroleum engineering to examine
the comprehensive field study they‟re working on in our local oil fields. And I‟d like you to read over the pack of
information I‟m about to hand out to you before we go. It should familiarize you with the history of the oil field we
will be touring as well as the details of their project.

TPO 51-Conversion 1 (Biology Experiment Reproduction)
Listen to part of a conversation between a student and her biology professor.
Professor：So, the assignment is to reproduce one of the animal camouflage experiments we read about in our
textbook. Which experiment did you pick?
Student:Well, I was wondering if I can try to reproduce an experiment that‟s……kind of the opposite of what was
discussed in the textbook?
Professor:So instead of how and why an animal might hide itself, you want to do something about why an animal
might want to be seen? Em? Tell me more.
Student:Well, I got the idea from one of the journals you said we should look at. It‟s an experiment about
ah……they called them eyes bugs in the article?
Professor:Eyes bugs, sure. The patterns on the wings of moths and butterflies that are generally believed to scare off
predators because they look like big eyes?
Student:Yeah. Except the article was about the experiment that disputes that theory.
Professor:Well, we know that the markings do scare the birds but the idea that the spots looked like eyes is……well,
that is just a commonly held belief.
Student:So, that‟s not even based on research?
Professor:Well, this whole idea of moths and butterfly markings being scary because they looked like eyes, rest on
how we imagine the predators, like birds, perceive the markings. And we can never really know that. All we can do
is observe bird behavior. But tell me more about the experiment.
Student: Ok. It said the experiment looked at the shapes of the markings on moths‟ wings. The researchers wanted to
know if the markings that were round and eye-shaped were more effective in deterring predators than square and
rectangular markings.
Professor: OK.
Student:Yeah. So they attached food to paper models of moths with different shaped marks drawn on the wings to
see how birds reacted. And what‟s interesting is they realized the round marks were not more effective in scaring
bird than other shapes.
Professor:Were they less effective?
Student:No, they were about the same. But what researchers did determine is that larger markings were more
effective than smaller markings in scaring off prey. They call this phenomenon “visual aliveness”.
Professor:Visual aliveness. Um. Well, I guess that it is not all that shocking if you think about it.
Student:So anyway, is it ok? Can I repeat this experiment and write about it?
Professor:Yes, I think that‟ll work. The problem I proceed is……well……where? This is an urban campus, you‟ll
have a hard time finding a good place to set up the experiment.
Student:Oh, I wasn‟t planning on doing it on campus. I‟m going home for spring break and my family lives in the
country, far from the near city. I can set it up in the backyard.
Professor:Good idea. Except one week is not a lot of time, so you will need to make some adjustments to have
enough data. I‟d set up the experiment near bird feeder and get in as much observation time as you can.

TPO 51-Lecture 1 (Maize and Teosinte)
Listen to part of a lecture in a botany class.
Professor:So, continuing with crop domestication and corn, or, um, maize as is often called, obviously it‟s one of the
world‟s most important crops today. It‟s such a big part of the diet in so many countries and it‟s got so many
different uses that it‟s hard to imagine a world without it. But because it doesn‟t grow naturally, without human
cultivation, and because there‟s no obvious wild relative of maize, um, well, for the longest time researchers weren‟t
able to find any clear link between maize and other living plants. And that‟s made it hard for them to trace the
history of maize.
Now, scientific theories about the origins of maize first started coming out in the 1930s, one involved a plant calle d
teosinte.Teosinte is a tall grass that grows wild in certain parts of Mexico and Guatemala. When researchers first
started looking at wild teosinte plants, they thought there was a chance that the two plants, um, maize and teosinte,
were related. The young wild teosinte plant looks a lot like the corn plant. And the plants continue to resemble each
other, at least superficially, even when they‟re developed.
But when the scientists examined the fruits of the two plants, it was a different story. When you look at right corn,
you see roll upon roll of juicy kernels, um, all those tiny little yellow squares that people eat. Fully-grown teosinte,
on the other hand, has a skinny stock that holds only a dozen or so kernels behind a hard, um, almost a stone -like
casing. In fact, based on the appearance of its fruit, teosinte was initially considered to be a closer relative to rice
than to maize.
But there was one geneticist, named George Beadle, who didn‟t give up so easily on the idea that teosinte might be,
well, the parent of corn. While still a student in the 1930s, Beadle actually found that the two plants have very
similar chromosomes, very similar genetic information. In fact, he was even able to make fertile hybrids between the
two plants. In hybridization you remember, the genes of two species of plants are mixed to produce a new third
plant, a hybrid. And if this offspring, this hybrid, is fertile, then that suggests that the two species are closely related
genetically. This new hybrid plant looked like an intermediate, right between maize and teosinte. So Beadle
concluded that maize must have been developed over many years, ah, that is a domesticated form of teosinte.
Many experts in the scientific community, however, remained unconvinced by his conclusions. They believed that
with so many apparent differences between the two plants, it would have been unlikely that ancient, the pre -historic
peoples could have domesticated maize from teosinte. I mean, when you think about it, these people lived in small
groups, and they had to be on the move constantly as the seasons changed. So for them to selectively breed, to have
the patience to be able to pick out just the right plants and gradually over generations, separate out the durable
nutritious maize plant from the Beadle teosinte that easily broke apart, it‟s a pretty impressive feat.
And you can easily see why so many experts would have been skeptical. But as it turns out, Beadle found even more
evidence for his theory when he continued his experiments, producing new hybrids, to investigate the genetic
relationship between teosinte and maize. Through these successful experiments, he calculated that only about 5
specific genes were responsible for the main differences between teosinte and maize. The plants were otherwise
surprisingly similar, genetically.
And more recently, botanists have used modern DNA testing to scan plant samples collected from throughout the
western hemisphere. This has allowed them to pinpoint where the domestication of maize most likely took
place. And their research took them to a particular river valley in southern Mexico. They‟ve also been able to
estimate that the domestication of maize most likely occurred about 9000 years ago. And subsequent archaeological
digs have confirmed this estimate. In one site, archaeologists uncovered a set of tools that were nearly 9000 years
old. And these tools were covered with a dusty residue, a residue of maize as it turns out. Thus making them the
oldest physical evidence of maize that we found so far.

TPO 51-Lecture 2 (The Transmission of A Number System)
Listen to part of a lecture in a world history class.
Professor:So one of the more common topics that comes up in world history because it‟s had a pretty dramatic effect on how different
societies evolved over long periods of time is cultural diffusion. Now, cultural diffusion is generally defined as the transmission of
culture from one society to another. And by culture, we mean anything from artistic styles to……um……you know, technology,
science. So we use culture very broadly. A common means of this process taking place is trade, travelling merchants or trading hubs,
places where people from various areas all come together and ideas get exchanged.
Let‟s start with the example of the transmission of a number system, a system that used the number Zero, from South Asia into
Western Europe.
Ok, so before this cultural diffusion happened, the dominant number system in Western Europe was the Roman Numeral System. The
Roman Numeral System developed primarily as a means of record-keeping, as a way to keep track of commercial transactions, um,
taxes, censors‟ records, things of that sort. As a consequence, this system started with the number One.
Student:With One? Not with Zero?
Professor:Right. See in Roman Numerals, Zero isn‟t really a value in and out itself. It wasn‟t used independently as a number on its
own. If your primary concerns just basic types of record-keeping……
Student:Oh, yeah. I guess you wouldn‟t need a Zero to count livestock.
Professor:Or to keep track of green production or do a census. And it wasn‟t an impediment as far as sort of basic engineering was
concerned either, um, to their ability to construct buildings, roads, stuff like that.
But other number systems developed in Asia, systems that do incorporate Zero. The mathematics these societies developed included
things like negative numbers. So you start to get more sophisticated levels of mathematics.
So one of the earliest written text sub mathematics, that has Zero, negative numbers, even some sort of basic algebra, is written in
South Asia in the early 7th century. This text makes its way into the Middle East, to Baghdad. And it‟s eventually translated into
Arabic by a Persian astronomer and mathematician. Once he began his translation, he quickly realizes the advantage of this system,
the types of math that can be done. Soon, the text begins to be more widely circulated through the Middle East. And other
mathematicians start to advocate using this number system.
So by the 10th century, it‟s the dominant system in the Middle East. And as a consequence, algebra and other more sophisticated
forms of mathematics start to flourish. Meanwhile, in Western Europe, the Roman Numeral System, a system without Zero, was still
in place.
In the late 12th century, an Italian Mathematician named Fibonacci was travelling in North Africa along with his father, a
merchant. And while he‟s there, Fibonacci discovers this Arabic text. He translates the text into Latin, and returns to Europe. And he
promotes the adoption of this number system because of the advantages in recording commercial transactions, calculating interests,
things of that nature. Within the next century and the half, that becomes the accepted dominant number system in Western Europe.
Any questions? Robert?
Robert:Um, this Fibonacci, is he the same guy who invented that……um…….that series of numbers?
Professor:Ah……yes. The famous Fibonacci sequence. Although he didn‟t actually invent it, it was just an example that had been
used in your original text. I mean, can you imagine? Introducing the concept of Zero to Western Europe? And this is what you go
down in history for?
Carol?
Carol:So, do we see like an actual change in everyday life in Europe after the Zero comes in? Or they really just……
Professor:Well, well, the change takes place is in the development of sciences.
Carol:Oh.
Professor:Even in basic engineering. It isn‟t a radical change. Um, but as you start to get into, again, the theoretical sciences, ah,
higher forms of mathematics, calculus, Zero had a much bigger influence in their development.Ok, now note that as cultural diffusion
goes, this was a relatively slow instance. Some things tend to spread much quicker, um, for example, artistic, or architectural styles,
such as domes used in architecture. We see evidence of that being diffused relatively quickly from Rome to the Middle East to South
Asia…

TPO 51-Conversion 2 (Trip to the New York City)
Listen to a conversation between a student and the director of the Student Activity Cente r.
Director:Hello, Jack. Is everything set for the trip this Saturday?
Student:Everything‟s ready. Ah, fifteen people have signed up. Our train gets into New York City at noon which leaves plenty of time to get
downtown to the art gallery for the reception.
Director:It‟s great. You could organize this. What an honor having a painting by one of our students in that exhibit!
Student:Yeah. My roommate‟s so modest. If we weren‟t such good friends, I‟d never realize that his work was being exhibited. So, since I
was going anyway for the opening and all, I figure that might as well make a student event out of it. Working here at the Student Activity
Centers made me realize how popular our activities are. I figure they‟ll be interested in it.
Director:Well you've done a super job organizing everything. This poster was great. And they were up in no time.
Student:Thanks. And I‟m glad you could approve the funding for us.
Director:My pleasure. By the way, how are you getting to the gallery from the train‟s station?
Student:Well, there are buses that run downtown.
Director:Right. You grew up in New York City, didn‟t you?
Student:Yeah. But, the bus, well, that‟s kind of what I want to talk to you about.
Director:Yes.
Student:I realized that at the last minute, but, well, the weather for Saturday is supposed to be really nice, sunny, warm. It‟ll be a great
opportunity to walk the High Line.
Director:The……what?
Student:Haven‟t you?......Oh, I guess not everyone has heard of it. It‟s this amazing……it‟s like this park in the sky.
Director:A park in the sky?
Student:Yeah. Well, see there was this old train line. You know one of those elevated lines, the kind that run high above the streets?
Director:OK.
Student:Well, this one was used for freight, not passengers.
Director:Aha.
Student:But when it got cheaper to move freight by trucks, they stop using it. It was abandoned for a long time. And then, a few years back,
the city agreed to turn the tracks and the surrounding area into a park. It‟s not very wide but it‟s over a mile long. And it goes from the train
station all the way downtown near the gallery.I‟ve walked before, it‟s really cool.There was grass and flowers everywhere, an d since you‟re
high up, you get these great views of the city.
Director:Sounds wonderful. But have you considered not everybody might be interested in walking that far? They might prefer the bus.
Student:Couldn‟t we just split up?You know how some of us walk and the others take the bus?
Director:But remember, Jack, the poster advertises you as the tour leader, not everybody sees the adventure about getting around the city.You
need to find someone to accompany people on the bus, then you take the walkers.
Student:Yeah. But who? Um, the trip‟s in two days.
Director:Well, I did my graduate work in New York, of course it was a while ago, but I still know how to get around the city.
Student:Yeah……
Director:And I‟d love to see that exhibit.
Student:You‟d go? Ah, that‟ll be great!

TPO 51-Lecture 3 (Audubon the Famous Illustrator)
Listen to part of a lecture in an art history class. The professor has been discussing illustrated books.
Professor:I want to take a look one particular book to give you an idea about what was involved in publishing
illustrated books in the 1800s.The book‟s called The Birds of the America and the illustrator was John James
Audubon.
So,The Birds of the America, four volumes which contained illustrations of nearly every bird in the United States,
over 400 birds, all hand-colored, all painted life-sized, the largest birds painted on the largest printing paper
available at that time.This required a lot of dedication. And Audubon is best remembered as an incredibly
meticulous accurate artist, a very accomplished illustrator of the natural world.
And while there were other artists working on the similar project at the same time, Audubon‟s book remains the
most well-known and successful of its kind. But, let‟s talk a bit about Audubon himself first.
First of all, Audubon was not a traditional painter.And by this I mean that he didn‟t work in oils. He preferred to use
water color and pastel crayons.And he worked on paper instead of on canvas.The thing is, Audubon considered the
illustrations in his book, not the original water colors, to be his finished product.His water colors were merely
preparatory studies, most of which were painted while he was observing birds in the wild.These water colors were
then sent to his printer who created the final prints for the book. And Audubon was so concerned with accuracy that
he often scribbled notes to the printer around the edges of these original water colors.
In fact, you might question whether producing a work of art was even Audubon‟s goal. Now, when I look at
Audubon‟s illustrations, I see a work of art. But, it may make more sense to consider Audubon, first and foremost,
as a naturalist, as a scientist. See, the early 19th century when Audubon was painting was a time of major scientific
inquiry. And an essential way of spreading scientific knowledge was through those illustrated books.
Student:So what did Audubon consider himself? An artist or a scientist?
Professor:I‟m not sure the distinction between the two was all that clear in the 1800s. I think we can accurately state
that the driving force in his art was getting the science right. And this was perhaps a point that critics of his art work
at that time just didn‟t appreciate.
Audubon also study birds in ways that didn‟t directly inform his art. Ah, you know what bird banding is right? A
bird has a band attached to its foot so we can learn about things like migration patterns. Well, the first recorded
instance of anyone doing that, it was Audubon. Another example, a common belief of that time was that vultures
used their sense of smell to find food. Audubon didn‟t believe that. So, he tested it. He put a large painting of a dead
sheep in a field, and sure enough, vultures found it and started pecking at it.
Now, Audubon‟s work was very accurate, and we know this because we can compare his illustrations to the birds
around us. But sometimes it‟s not possible to check. There are actually several birds in his book that no one‟s ever
seen. These are sometimes called Audubon‟s mystery birds, because even though he drew them, there is no evidence
that they exist in the wild.
For someone who‟s respected as a naturalist, isn‟t it strange to think that he drew some birds that don‟t appear to be
real? For example, there is an illustration that appears to be a type of warbler, a small bird. It has a white ring around
its eyes and white bars on its wings. No one‟s ever seen a warbler like this, so some people wonder if Audubon
maybe forgot certain details about this bird when he painted it, or that he copied another artist‟s work. But
considering that Audubon was such a meticulous artist, well, that might be a better answer.
Hybridization is something that‟s well-known in birds. And it definitely explains the rather unique-looking duck
Audubon painted. He himself suggested that maybe it wasn‟t an unknown species but a hybrid, born from two
different species. Since then, this particular crossing species has actually been recorded, both in the wild and in
captivity. So it turns out that Audubon was right. And this duck actually was a hybrid.

TPO 51-Lecture 4 (Heliocentric Theory)
Listen to part of a discussion in a history of science class. The class is discussing the heliocentric theory.
Male Student:What I found really difficult to understand is why the heliocentric theory, um, why wasn‟t like believed by
everybody right away?
Professor:Well, one thing that‟s hard to do is to sort of see things from the perspective of someone who‟s hearing that theor y for
the first time. I mean today we tend to assume that the moment the heliocentric theory was laid out, the idea that the Sun, not
the Earth, was the center of the solar system, that you know, you‟d have to be in denial, not to accept it. But it really wasn‟t that
easy.
Male Student:But the idea that the earth wasn‟t the center of the universe……that has been tossed around for like centuries,
right? I mean, lots of people would have the idea.
Professor:Yes, that‟s true, going all the way back to the Ancient Greeks. But in Europe, when Galileo championed it in the 17th
century, during part of his discoveries using a telescope, there still was some major resistance to it.
Male Student:But I still don‟t understand why, I mean, isn‟t it obvious?
Professor:Well, despite Galileo‟s ingenious arguments in support of the heliocentric theory, there was still a lot of reasons why
people of that period couldn‟t buy into it. Remember, we are talking about four hundred years ago, so ah, let‟s think about a few
of those reasons, Ok?
So, first of all, they could work out that if the Earth was going around the Sun, then it had to be traveling at many thousan ds of
kilometers per hour. And that was just beyond anything anyone could understand. You know, they could understand riding a
horse or walking, maybe they could get up to 30, 32 kilometers per hour. But tens of thousands of kilometers per hour? That
was just crazy. So, to many people, whatever is going on, it couldn‟t be that.
Female Student:Um… So people didn‟t believe the heliocentric theory because it was so hard to believe?
Professor:Exactly. But, there were more scientific kinds of reactions as well. Because, look, if you have ever been on a carousel
or you are on a ride at an amusement park and you are on something that is going round round and round, two things,
alright?One, you know you are moving, there is no doubt.And the other thing is, you know that unless you hold on tight, you
are gonna go flying out because of centrifugal force, right?
Female Student:So, if I understand you for the average person 400 hundred years ago there was no evidence that we are moving
at higher speed, right?Since everything was securely on the ground and no one was flying off into space?
Professor:Yes. And in particular. And this was one specific difficulty for people in the period, even if they thought that there
was some sort of force that maybe kept you and me and buildings and things on the surface of the Earth. Their theory about the
nature of the atmosphere was that nothing was holding it down. So if, if you can understand that way of thinking, then clearly,
if the Earth, was moving at a great speed, we should‟ve lost all our atmosphere a long time ago. You know, it would be like,
trailing away behind us. And so, I want to try a little sort of experiment, because, I, I think that what we will find is that some of
us have ideas about motion that actually fit with anti-heliocentrism.
Male Student:Anti-heliocentrism? No way. It‟s the 21st century.
Professor:Well, then let‟s see. So, picture the following. You are at the equator, moving at 1600 kilometers per hour. Ok? And
you drop something, small and light, like a matchstick for example. Where is it going to land?
Male Student:That‟s easy. It will be long gone. The matchstick is so light that it will fly right out of my hand and end up away
behind me somewhere.
Professor:Ah, actually, that matchstick you dropped, it‟ll land right at your feet.
Male Student:What?
Professor:Well, let‟s think about it. If I got to consider that the Earth‟s rotating at 1600 kilometer per hour at the equator, and
you, me, the air, and that matchstick will all moving together at the same speed, even though it doesn‟t seem or look or feel like
we are moving. So class, clearly, even today, we actually have some inclination to think that if the Earth were moving around at
a great speed, we all would see signs of it. Perhaps now you are less inclined to dismiss those who once found heliocentrism so
hard to believe. Ok, let‟s move on.

TPO 52-Conversion 1 (Explication of Pablo Neruda’s Poem)
Listen to a conversation between a student and his creative writing professor.
Professor: John, listen. I can clearly see that you put a lot of time into your response paper.
John: I did! It took me forever. I rewrote it a dozen times.
Professor: And your hard work shows. Unfortunately, it‟s a week late.
John: I know. Sorry. I just got a little behind, you know, sports and homework. But I‟m on top of things now.
Professor: Glad to hear it! Now, as for our meeting today, I‟d like to talk to all of my creative writing students one
on one at least once during the term and see how they‟re doing.
John: I think I‟m doing OK. Busy, you know, but other than that…
Professor: Well, I found through the years that some of my assignments can be pretty tough for first year students
like yourself, like the response paper you just did, the explication of a Pablo Neruda poem. Emm…by the way, why
did you choose "The Lemon"? It‟s an unusual choice.
John: It was my favorite in the book of Neruda‟s poems. All the poems are about everyday objects and, you know,
simple pleasures.
Professor: Right, Elemental Odes, one of my favorites.
John: I like how Neruda took things like fruit and vegetables and socks, and use metaphors and similes to describe
them as these wonderful mysterious things, like in“The Lemon". He describes a lemon falling to Earth from the
stars, and he compares a slice of lemon to a stained glass window. It‟s so original!
Professor: Beautiful images, aren‟t they? Neruda didn‟t win the Nobel Prize for literature by accident.
John: No, he didn‟t.
Professor: Now, as you know, the paper was only the first half of the assignment, and I‟m concerned about your
ability to complete the second part on time, considering how much time the first part took you.
John: Actually, I finished it just before I came here.
Professor: Excellent!
John: It was tricky, too. You know, having to write a poem inspired by "The Lemon", but in a completely different
style.
Professor: Right!
John: In order to do that, I really had to study Neruda‟s style and read a lot of his stuff, which was great, but "The
Lemon" is free verse. So to do the assignment, I decided to use a strict meter - iambic pentameter, to be as different
as possible.
Professor: So each line of your poem has ten syllables and every other syllable is stressed. Interesting choice! Iambic
pentameter is certainly different from free verse.
John: It was hard for me though, because usually when I write a poem, I choose my own topic, and I just write. I
don‟t worry about counting syllables or anything. So, I‟m kind of hoping we won‟t have more assignments like this?
Professor: Sorry to disappoint you, but these assignments are designed to get you out of your comfort zone, to get
you reading and writing a wide variety of poetic styles.

TPO 52-Lecture 1 (Still-life Painting)
Listen to part of a lecture in an art class.
Professor:This week you are going to be studying something new, a painting in still-life. First I want to give you a
little background that might be helpful when you start working. We spend a lot of time on portrays in this class and
moving from painting people to painting objects, might feel like a big shift. But I think it‟s important for you to
understand that you could pack just as much life and vibrancy and excitement into a painting of a bowl of fruit as
you can into something more dynamic.
And, you know, still-lives don‟t just need to be straightforward representations. A lot of still-life painters really use
the simplicity of the style to send a message or tell a story, even portrays sometimes include elements of still-life
paintings. For example, in a portray, there might be a map, hanging on the wall. Or there might be some books on
the table next to the subject. These objects tell you something about the subject like maybe that person was welleducated.
A big part of still-life painting is the use of those kinds of symbols. The objects you include can provide more
contacts than help convey your message. I‟d also like to show everyone an example of still-life that we can talk
about a little and use to get some inspiration.
This is by James Peale, one of the true masters of the art of still-life.This piece is called Still-life, bowls, some
apples and vegetables. And it‟s a really, really great example of what I‟m going to be looking forward in your
painting.
Now, Peale did his work in the early 19th century. And painters of that period approached still-life painting from a
scientific perspective. Let‟s look at this painting to help you understand what I mean. See the red tomatoes in the
foreground and how vibrate that color is? And if you look at the large heads of cabbage farther back, every detail,
every crinkle in each leaf, all the fruits, are so precise. They are almost like a sketch you‟d see in a field guide. Peale
and other painters of this era used still-life painting as a way of exploring the natural world and satisfying their
curiosity about nature.
So now we can take some time to discuss a little more of… more about the… the actual process of still-life
painting. Now, before you paint a single stroke, you‟ve got to plan the composition of your painting. You know, the
arrangement of the objects to make sure everything is set up the way you wanted. I remember a still-life piece I
painted when I was in university. It was vegetables I think and I had created scratches of the setting. But then I
realized the arrangement of the vegetables in a basket just, just didn‟t look right. So I had to start over. So I can say
from experiment it‟s really important to make sure your arrangement is just right before you even start painting.
Now, what are some ways to make sure the composition of your painting is the way you want it to be? Well, it‟s
important in the still-life to make sure you‟re not overdoing the amount of positive space, the amount of stuff in your
piece. The still-life really is not just about the subject matter. If you make a really cluttered composition with too
much going on, it can throw off your painting. That‟s something you notice in the James Peale painting. Notice how
it really… you know it makes great use of negative space, you can see how he sort of embraces those little empty
spots on the table. And that adds a really nice sense of balance.
Also, try to make your still-life look natural. If it looks contrived and if it‟s obvious a person deliberately arranged
everything, it takes away from the simplicity and the natural feel of the work. Basically the best still-life paintings
are the ones where the objects don‟t look arranged for the painting at all, but that those tomatoes are near that
cabbage on a table by accident.

TPO 52-Lecture 2 (Interactions within an Ecosystem)
Listen to part of a lecture in an environmental science class.
Professor:Today we are going to begin discussing ecosystems. One important point I want to emphasize in the reading is that
there are many interactions that take place within an ecosystem, interactions between animals, interactions between living an d
non-living things and so on. Now these interactions can be fairly simple and straightforward.
Ah, there are certain species of ants and rodents sharing a desert ecosystem in Arizona. And they compete for the same plants to
eat. And the competition influence is not only the size of the ant and rodent populations, but also the number of eventual
plants. Now, this interaction is easy to see, right? However, there are many other interactions within ecosystems that are not so
apparent and require closer examination. And the example from your reading was the forest ecosystem along the Pacific coast
of North America. Um, specifically the role of salmon.
Ok, as you probably know, salmon are born in fresh water streams, they might ran to oceans where they spent most of their
lives. And then they return to the same streams where they were born to reproduce, or spawn. In order to spawn, salmon need
cold, clear streams to ensure the survival of their eggs. And trees in the surrounding forest play an important role here. Their
leaves provide shade from the Sun. When logging removes the trees, the streams are open to the Sun and the water becomes
warmer. When the water warms up, the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the water decreases. And this reduces the chance
that the salmon eggs will survive.
And the trees also help keep the soil on the banks of the stream in place. Salmon cannot spawn in streambeds clogged with
sediment, dirt, from the surrounding area. They need a clean, graveled streambed.
Bred?
Bred:I read that salmon also help keep stream healthy.
Professor:Right. Salmon contribute important nutrients like carbon and phosphorus. And these nutrients promote diversity in
the stream environment. Ok, um, so salmon need trees to successfully reproduce, but surprisingly trees also need s almon. And
bears play an important intermediary role. So in the autumn, bears are busy putting on extra-weight as they prepare to
hibernate. Each bear catches an estimated 700 fish during the 45 days that the salmon are spawning.
The bears catch the salmon in the streams and then they carry them back into the forest to eat. Sometimes as much as 800
meters from the streams. And since the bears only eat about half of each fish they catch, other animals like eagles, crows and
insects feed on the leftovers.
Maria?
Maria:Why did the bears bring the salmon so far into the forest? Why not just eat the fish near the streams?
Professor:Well, imagine several hungry bears looking for salmon. When one bear catches a fish, it‟s not uncommon for another
bear to try stealing it. These confrontations can be pretty intense. So it‟s safer to bring it back into the forest, to a place where
the bear can eat undisturbed.
Bred:Um, you said that the bears only eat half of each fish they catch? I mean if I were a bear preparing to hibernate, I probably
eat everything I can catch.
Professor:Well, certain parts of a salmon are more nourishing, fattier than others. It‟s actually more efficient for a bear to only
eat some parts of the fish and then try catching another one, instead of eating the whole fish.
Ok. So after the scavengers have eaten the leftovers, only the fish‟s skeleton remains. Now, salmon contain nitrogen. So their
decomposing bodies as skeletons provide a lot of nitrogen to the surrounding forest. Plants absorb this nitrogen which they need
to grow. So the transfer of this nitrogen to the forest is important. Forest near streams with salmon actually reach maturity faster
than other forests.
Ok, so, why‟s all these important? Well, salmon are in trouble. Some of their populations have gone extinct. And most of the
remaining populations have been significantly reduced by overfishing and environmental challenges. Now, conservationists can
try to prevent overfishing but, well, I mean you can see the interconnections within this ecosystem. We‟ve already talked about
the importance of trees to salmon and the negative effect that something like logging can have. So you can see that protecting
this ecosystem is going to take a broad effort.

TPO 52-Lecture 3 (Snowflakes and Ozone)
Listen to part of a lecture in a chemistry class.
Professor: Ok, so, today we‟re going to talk about the Arctic, ozone depletion and snowflakes. And it‟s all
related. Let‟s start with snowflakes.
Now, I find snowflakes fascinating. To even begin to understand them, you need to understand physics, chemistry,
and mathematics.Even though there‟s been a lot of research, there‟re still actually a lot about snowflakes that we
don‟t understand yet. Hard to believe, I know.
Anyway, snowflakes have a particular form, there‟s a six-sided center with six branches or arms that radiate out
from it. But how did they get that way? Well, you start with water vapor. You need a pretty humid atmosphere. And
that water vapor condenses directly into ice, into an ice crystal. At this point it looks kind of like a thin dinner plate
that rather than being circular, is hexagonal with six flat edges.
It‟s at this point in the process were we begin to see why each snowflake is unique. Imagine this dinner plate is
floating around in the wind, right? And when it encounters water vapor, molecules from that vapor attached to each
of the six sides. You begin this development with six arms or branches radiating out from the center plate. Each time
the snowflake encounters water vapor, more molecules attached to it, leading to more and more complex
structures. And of course, each snowflake takes unique route through the clouds on its way down. And so the
quantity of water vapor that it goes through is going to be unique for each one.
Now one important characteristic of snowflakes is that they have something called a quasi-liquid layer, the
QLL. Our snowflake is an ice crystal, right? Well, we find a quasi-liquid layer on the surface of ice is basically a
thin layer of water that‟s not completely frozen. And the existed temperature is well below freezing, though
thickness varies at different temperatures. Now this quasi-liquid layer, it plays an important role on what we are
going to talk about next.
Ah, yes, Mary?
Mary:How can liquid exist below freezing? Why doesn‟t it freeze?
Professor:Well, when water becomes ice, the molecules bond together and it gets sort of…locked in the place. They
can‟t move around as much anymore. So each molecule is surrounded by other molecules, and they are all locked
together. But what about the exterior of the ice? There is a layer of water molecules on the surface, they attached
molecules only on one side. So, they are a bit freer. They can move around a bit more. Think of a… think of a brick
wall. The bricks in the wall, they have other bricks above and below them, and they are all locked against each
other. But that top layer, it only has a layer below it. Now this can only be taken so far because of course bricks
don‟t move at all. They are not liquid. But the bricks of water molecules, well, this top layer would be the quasiliquid layer. And it wouldn‟t be completely frozen. Does that make sense?
So, finally we get to the connection between snowflakes and ozone. Ozone is a gas found in the atmosphere of
Earth. Now there is the ozone found in the stratosphere which is the layer of the atmosphere from 6 to 30 miles
above the Earth. This is considered good ozone, which occurs naturally and helps block harmful radiation from the
Sun.
But there is also ground-level ozone. It‟s exactly the same gas but it‟s found closer to the surface of the Earth. This
ground-level ozone results from human activities, at high concentrations it can be a pollutant. Now snowflake‟s
quasi-liquid layer plays an important role in some complex chemical reactions. We‟re going to be looking at these in
detail later today. But basically, these reactions cause certain chemicals to be released. And these chemicals reduce
the amount of ground-level ozone. So the more branches you have in an ice crystal, the more quasi-liquid layer there
is. The more quasi-liquid layer, the more reactions and the more chemicals that reduce ground-level ozone. So you
can see why this is such an important system to study and understand.

TPO 52-Lecture 4 (Maya Civilization)
Listen to part of a lecture in an archeology class. The professor has been discussing ancient Mayan civilization.
Professor: Now, as you remember from your reading, the Maya were an ancient civilization which occupied in area
corresponding to parts of modern-day Mexico and Central America. Early Mayan settlements date back over 3,000
years and say from about 600 to 900 C.E. The civilization was in what‟s considered a golden age of cultural
achievement, what we call the Classic period.
The period after this, after the Classic Period, is called the Postclassic period. Now it‟s long been thought that during
the PostClassic period, Mayan civilization was in decline. But we‟re continuing to find new evidence that in certain
areas Mayan civilization flourished right up to the end of the Postclassic period, what we refer to as the late
Postclassic period. The late Postclassic corresponds to the period from the 1200s to 1500s, right until the arrival of
the Spanish in the mid-1500s. A good example of a site which continued to flourish through the late Postclassic is
the inland Mayan community of Lamanai, located in what is today the country of Belize in Central America. Now,
Lamanai is one of the largest and most prominent archeological sites in Belize. It was occupied for over 3000
years. That makes it the longest continually-occupied site by the ancient Maya. Large-scale excavation at Lamanai
began back in 1974 under the leadership of a Canadian archeologist. The first excavation there was on a building
that dated back to the late Postclassic period. When the excavation began, we didn‟t know much about Mayan life
during that time. As I said, most people considered the Postclassic period as a time of decline that came after the socalled golden era. But during the first few years of excavation, the archeological team realized that Lamanai had
continued to be an important center of classic Mayan culture, almost right up until the 1500s.
Student: So basically, what you are saying is while other Mayan cities were collapsing or had already collapsed,
Lamanai was one of those places that was flourishing?
Professor: Uh huh…exactly! In fact, the evidence shows that one of the greatest periods of construction in the city
occurred during the Postclassic.That‟s definitely not what was happening at neighboring sites during that time. And
consider this, archeologists found ceramic artifacts from Lamanai‟s late Postclassic period at a recently-discovered
site on an island off the coast of Belize. And in Lamanai they found objects that had been imported from parts of the
region which correspond to modern-day Mexico during the late Postclassic. What did those finds tell us?
Female student: eh…the trade was still going on? So you probably still find the same Mayan social structure and
economic practices, right?
Professor: Yes. Now, these researchers and subsequent research teams have been helping us see a bigger picture. We
now know that there was still a widespread trading network up and down a long portion of the coast of what is
modern-day Mexico and Central America for more than two centuries after the golden era ended. Those finds are
telling.
Female student: How big is Lamanai overall?
Professor: Well, in all, 700 stone structures have been documented. It takes several life times and lots of funding to
uncover all of them. Ok, if that‟s not a helpful mental picture…all right here‟s another detail that might help. There
was once a population between 35 and 55 thousand there. The southernmost end of Lamanai had become the city
center by the Postclassic period. It was there at the southern end that people continued to develop technological
capabilities, especially in ceramics and eventually in metal work. The center of Lamanai society had previously been
in the northern part of the city. We‟re not yet sure why the focus of life shifted southward only that it did.
Female student: Was the former center, the one in the north smaller than the new one in the south? Like maybe the
population grew so they needed more room and moved?
Professor: Actually, the new city center was smaller. It‟s possible that‟s because the population had decreased by
that point so they actually needed less room. In any case, the restructured community thrived.

TPO 53-Conversion 1 (Questions about a Drama Class)
Listen to a conversation between a student and his drama professor.
Professor: Hi Robert. So how's your paper going?
Robert: Pretty well. It's a lot of work, but I‟m getting into it, so I don't mind. I‟ll probably have some questions for
you in the next week or so.
Professor: Okay. Glad to hear you‟re progressing so well.
Robert: Um… There was something you said at the end of the lecture on Tuesday, something about there not really
being any original plays.
Professor: There‟s no such thing as an original play. Yes. That's the direct quote from Charles Mee.
Robert: Mee… that's with two “e”s, right?
Professor: Yep. M-E-E. You'll probably be hearing a lot about him. He's becoming a pretty famous playwright.
Robert: Yeah，well, I‟ve been thinking about his quote. I mean there must be some original plays out there.
Professor: I‟ll grant that he's overstating things somewhat. But the theater does have a long tradition of
borrowing. Take Shakespeare. Like most writers of his day, he borrowed plots from other sources unabashedly. And
the ancient Greeks, all the plays they wrote were based on earlier plays, poems and myths.
Robert: And borrowing applies to plays being written nowadays, too?
Professor: To some extent, yes. Mee, for example, he's made a career out of remaking plays, one of which we‟ll be
studying soon. It‟s called Full Circle and Mee based it on an earlier play by a German playwright.
Robert: Oh Full Circle… Wasn't that based on the Caucasian Chalk Circle?
Professor: That's right.
Robert: I remember hearing about that play from my acting coach.
Professor: Okay. Well, the Caucasian Chalk Circle was based on a play by yet another German playwright, someone
who was fascinated by the ancient literatures of China, India and Persia, and many of his works were adapted from
those literatures, including his version of the Chalk Circle which was based on an early Chinese play.
Robert: So this Full Circle play, by Charles Mee, the one we're going to study, it's like the third or fourth
remake. Wow… And we complain that Hollywood keeps making the same movies over and over again.
Professor: Well, part of what Mee‟s trying to do is drive home the point that: One, theater‟s always a collaborative
effort.
Robert: Well, yeah, the playwright, the director, the actors, people have to work together to produce a play.
Professor: Yes, of course. But Mee means historically. The dramatic literature of early periods is hugely influential
in shaping later dramatic works.
Robert: So it's like when the playwright bases a play on a previous playwright's theme or message.It's like they're
talking to each other, collaborating. Uh, just not at the same time right?
Professor: Exactly. And the second point Mee's trying to make, I think, is that it's legitimate to retell an old story in a
new way, in a way that‟s, uh… more in line with contemporary concerns. So when playwrights reinvent or update an
earlier play, it shouldn't be construed as a lack of imagination or an artistic failure.

TPO 53-Lecture 1 (Sounds in the Film)
Listen to part of a lecture in a film studies class.
Professor: Nowadays we take sound in films for granted. I mean you still might see black and white films
occasionally. But you'll hardly ever see silent films anymore.
So it's interesting to note that the use of recorded sound was originally controversial. And some directors, uh, some
filmmakers even thought it shouldn't be used, that it would destroy the purity of cinema, somehow reverse all the
progress that had been made in the art of cinema. Abby?
Abby: What about all the sounds you hear in some silent movies? Like, you know, a loud sound when somebody
falls down or something?
Professor: Okay, you're talking about a soundtrack added much later, which has over time become part of the film
we know. But this recorded track didn't exist then.
And it's not that most people didn't want sound in films. It's just that the technology wasn't available yet. Don't
forget that instead of recorded sound, there was often live music that accompanied movies in those days, like a piano
player or a larger orchestra in the movie theater.
Also, think of the stage, the live theater, it has used wonderful sound effects for a long time. And if wanted, these
could be produced during the viewing of a film. You know, the rolling of drums for thunder or whatever. But that
wasn't as common.
Oh, and another thing, that they might have in movie theaters in the early days, was a group of live actors reading
the parts to go along with the film, or, and this seems a particularly bad idea to us now, one person narrating the
action, an early example of a long tradition of movie producers, the ones concerned mostly about making money, not
having much confidence in their audience, thinking that people somehow couldn't follow the events otherwise.
So, it finally became possible to play recorded sound as part of the film in the 1920s. Trouble was, it wasn't always
used to very good effect. First it was, you know, amazing to see somebody's mouth move at the same time you hear
the words, or hear a door close when you see it closing on screen.
But that luster wears off, of course. And if you're a director, a filmmaker, what's the next step?
Abby: Well, you sound to enhance the movie right? Bring something more to it that wasn‟t possible?
Professor: Yes. That‟s exactly what directors, who were more interested in cinema as art, not commerce, were
thinking.
But they also predicted that there would be a problem that sound would be misused and, boy, was it ever.Because
the commercial types, the producers and so on, were thinking, “Okay. Now that sound is possible, let's talk as much
as possible and forget about the fact that we're making a movie, that we have this powerful visual medium.”
So many of the films of the twenties were basically straight adaptations of successful shows from the stage,
theatre. The name they used for sound films then was “talking films” and that was on the mark, since, well, all they
pretty much did was talk and talk.
So, remedy? Well what was proposed by a number of filmmakers and theorists was the creative expressive use of
sound, what they generally called nonsynchronous sound.
Okay, synchronous sound means basically that what we hear is what we see. Everything on the soundtrack is seen on
the screen. And everything was recorded simultaneously, which… Well, since the sound technicians working on
films often had experience with live radio that made sense to them. Recording the sound separately and adding it in
afterward? Well, that idea was less obvious.
Anyway synchronous sound means the source of the sound is the image on the screen.Nonsynchronous sound then
is…
)
Abby: The sound doesn't match the picture?
Professor: Right. Now we can look at this in various ways. But let's take it as literally as possible.
Music, unless we see the radio or the orchestra, that's nonsynchronous. If the camera shot is of the listener rather
than the speaker that's nonsynchronous. If we hear, say, background sounds that aren't on the screen, that's
nonsynchronous.
So, that doesn't seem so radical, does it? But again, those early producers didn't think their audiences could keep up
with this.
Abby: Excuse me, but did you say earlier that some filmmakers actually advocated not using sound at all?
Professor: Well, yes. But that was a bit of an exaggeration, I guess. What I meant to say was that some filmmakers
thought that the way the film sound was actually used was setting the art of filmmaking back.But everyone agreed
that sounds solved some very difficult issues and offered potentially exciting tools.
TPO 53-Lecture 2 (Two Kinds of Pollution)
Listen to part of a lecture in an environmental science class.
Professor: The Chesapeake Bay on the east coast of United States is huge. The largest estuary in the U.S., and it‟s
very important to local economies.
But like many of the world‟s waterways, the Chesapeake is being polluted. And efforts to stop that from happening
have not been entirely successful. And that‟s partly because of the type of pollution affecting the Chesapeake which
may not be what you might predict.
Um, first let‟s mention that the sources of pollution are of two general types. And let‟s begin with what‟s known as
point source pollution. Point source pollution has an identifiable source and you can find the specific point where
say one particular pipe is dumping pollutants into the bay. And then treat the water right there where the pollution's
coming from.
And that‟s what's happened over the past thirty years or so. Modifications have been made in factories and sewage
treatment plants to treat polluted water before it‟s released into public waterways. But there‟s also something we call
non-point source pollution.
Nowadays the most serious pollution threat doesn‟t come from any particular source like a factory or sewage
treatment plant, but originates from many sources over a large area. And this non-point source pollution is a
challenge to deal with because it doesn‟t just enter the bay through one pipe. You can‟t identify precisely where it‟s
coming from.
And to be specific, the biggest problem now facing the Chesapeake Bay is due not to toxins but to nutrients
contained in chemical fertilizers used on farms all over the region. These nutrients like phosphorus and especially
nitrogen wash away what we call agricultural runoff. That‟s when water from a hard rain or from melting snow
carries these chemicals down to streams and into the bay.
And there they stimulate the explosive growth of algae and that uses up much of the oxygen in the water, oxygen
that fish and other aquatic organisms need to stay alive. So since there is no single place you can treat the runoff
before it reaches the bay, any efforts to reduce this non-point source pollution generally need to be aimed at keeping
pollution out of the streams in the first place.
But before we go into that, let‟s look at the role of nitrogen fertilizer in modern farming. Until about sixty years ago,
before a great increase in industrialization, this wasn‟t a problem. In the past, farmers use natural fertilizers, and
rotated crops so that in addition to commercial food crops like corn and wheat, they might plant legumes like alfalfa
and clover for animal feed.
)
But these legumes also enriched the soil by converting nitrogen in the atmosphere into nitrates, a form of nitrogen
that crops like wheat or corn could use as nutrient. And these and other cover crops, planted to hold the soil after the
wheat or corn was harvested. They stored much of the surplus nitrogen during the time of the year when the runoff
tended to be the greatest.
But farming practices changed as farmers came under pressure to use more and more chemical fertilizer in order to
increase crop production on the same amount of land. But more isn‟t always better, at least in terms of chemical
fertilizer in the environment. And along the way, farmers switch from legumes to animal feeds more suited to
intensive large scale animal production.
And the excess nitrogen once trapped by these cover crops either washed away in the next big rain or went down
into the groundwater and either way eventually ended up in the streams and the bay, and that as we said means more
algae in the water and less oxygen for the fish and other aquatic life to breathe.
So what‟s being done? Well, two things.
First, after the main crops are harvested, more farmers are planting cover crops again. Other kinds like rye and
barley that hold the nitrogen and keep it from washing out of the soil during the months when that most likely to
occur. And the second strategy is to plant buffer zones at the edges of streams. Not crops but natural areas,
trees. The roots of these trees can absorb the excess nitrogen in the runoff before it reaches the streams. Farmers
sometimes object to letting trees grow on land where they might otherwise be cultivating crops. But there‟s a
government program that compensates them, that pays them for creating these buffer zones between their fields and
the streams that eventually feed into bays like the Chesapeake and it‟s beginning to show some success.
TPO 53-Conversion 2 (Advice for Cafeteria)
Listen to a conversation between a student and a cafeteria manager.
Manager: Oh, hi, you're Amy, right?
Student: Yes.
Manager: I haven't seen you here for a while. Welcome back.
Student: Thanks. Uh, you're right. I haven't been eating here regularly like I used to.
Manager: Why not?
Student: A couple of reasons. First of all, I have a class that ends during lunch time. So by the time I get here, there's
hardly any food left.
Manager: Really?
Student: Yeah. And then I have a chemistry lab at night this semester. It's 2 hours every Tuesday and Thursday. You
know that building is way across campus. So I just eat something in my dorm before I leave or skip dinner
altogether. I come here afterward, but lab lets out at 7:30 and...By then the cafeteria is already closed.
Manager: Oh, I'm really sorry. Well, what about getting something to go and eating it in class?
Student: I can‟t. Food isn't permitted anywhere near the laboratories. I wish you stayed open later.
Manager: Have you complained formally? We've always had a suggestion box. And now, you can send us an e-mail.
Student: As a matter of fact, I did fill out a suggestion card. I asked for longer hours and for better food choices,
too. But that was like weeks ago. And nothing‟s changed from what I can see.
Manager: You know, I was just promoted to cafeteria manager, and one of the things I'm trying to do is pay more
attention to students' concerns. There have been a lot of complaints similar to yours over the years.
)
Student: Yeah. A lot of my friends complain about the cafeteria, but I figure nothing will ever be done.
Manager: Well, some things can change. For instance, you mentioned you like better food choices. Is there anything
in particular you like added to the menu?
Student: Hmm, I guess it'd be nice to get hot cereal in the morning, and maybe a wider choice of soups and salads at
lunch and dinner. And there should definitely be enough food to feed everyone whenever the cafeteria is open.
Manager: Hmm hmm. ... But all good suggestions. Say, were you aware that the university has recently formed a
food advisory committee? It includes myself, a nutritionist, the school chef, a food science professor and the person
who oversees the cafeteria budget.
Student: Do you want me to talk to the committee?
Manager: I was thinking you might like to serve on the committee. If you are interested, I'll recommend you as the
student representative.
Student: Oh, I'm not so sure if I have enough spare time to get that involved.
Manager: Ok, then why don't I let you know when and where our next meeting is? And we will put you on the
agenda. You may also want to send me an e-mail with all of your suggestions. Now that I am in charge, I will make
sure they get serious consideration.
Student: I‟d appreciate that. Thanks.
TPO 53-Lecture 3 (The History of Tea)
Listen to part of a lecture in a world history class.
Professor: Now, according to Chinese legend, the first person to drink tea was a Chinese emperor who lived nearly
5000 years ago. This emperor was, oh, you could call him an amateur scientist. And he wisely required all drinking
water to be boiled for hygiene. So, once, emm, when visiting some distant part of his empire, he noticed that a
breeze had blown some leaves into his pot of boiling water and these leaves turned the water kind of brown. So,
well, would it be your first impulse to drink this? Probably not. But he thought the resulting brews smell pretty
good. And in the name of science and discovery, he tasted it. And the practice of drinking tea was born.
Oh, well, a good story. But actually we cannot say with any certainty just who first discovered how to make tea. We
can be confident though, that the Chinese have been using it in some form for close to 5000 years. And from those
earliest times, more and more tea was cultivated to meet the growing demand, and tea became an important part of
the economy of China. In fact, it was formed into sort of bricks, and used as a common type of currency for
trade. But its effect on Chinese culture was even more profound. Tea became extremely popular in China, and
scholars even wrote works discussing how to grow tea, prepare it, drink it, really championing tea; one of them
saying it was like the sweetest dew of heaven.
Now, recommendations like this could only add to its huge popularity there. But tea was also spreading throughout
Asia. In Japan, perhaps even more than in China, tea became a major cultural symbol, and one of refinement of
etiquette and aesthetics. Well, best seen in the traditional Japanese tea ceremony, which is still performed
today. This is an intricate formal ritual, emm, ceremony that can take hours to complete.Clearly, tea became not just
a beverage in Japanese culture but much much more. Tea eventually got to western Europe, after European traders,
mainly Portuguese and Dutch, brought the first small commercial shipment of tea back to Europe. Unfortunately, it
was mostly just treated as a curiosity, since no one knew quite how it was supposed to be used.
A few has some pretty strong opinions though. One German doctor wrote a book saying tea was harmful, actually
poisonous. But at about the same time, another doctor from Holland wrote another book calling tea „a miracle cure
for just about everything‟. Who to believe?
So, anyway, tea didn‟t really catch on in Germany or France, as something just to enjoy drinking, they seem to
prefer coffee. But England did take to tea. And to an extent that nobody could have foreseen. Such that, even today
)
we tend to associate England, Great Britain with tea. And, well, a bit of perspective, at the start of the 18th century,
almost nobody in England drank tea. But by the end of it, almost everybody did. By the 1750s, official records show
tea imports up from almost nothing to about 20 million kilos. And those records didn‟t even begin to account for all
the tea smuggled into the country illegally to avoid paying taxes. And as for reasons for the popularity of tea there,
well, tea first became fashionable after the king of England married a Portuguese princess who loved tea. And pretty
soon, more and more people started copying her and drinking tea. Later, when a direct trade route was established
between China and England, the supply of tea greatly increased. Most important though, tea drinking became
sociable. And although coffee houses or tavern were generally considered to be for men only, tea shops became
places where women could come. And even bring their families. And soon there were tea parties, books on tea
etiquette, and even tea gardens—parks filled with lights and walkways and venues for musical performances, places
where people of all social classes could go to drink tea and socialize. By the end of the 18th century, all classes of
English society drank tea, from royalty to common workers. Tea became a staple of everyday life, part of the
common culture, and traditionally considered by many, the very mark of being English.
TPO 53-Lecture 4 (Saturn's Rings)
Listen to part of a lecture in an astronomy class.
Professor: Saturn‟s rings have always baffled astronomers.Until about 30 years ago, we thought the rings were
composed of particles of ice and rock that were left over from Saturn‟s formation, extra material that never managed
to form er...er coalesce into a moon.
As you know, it‟s believed that Saturn and all the planets in our solar system, coalesced from a swirling cloud of gas
some 4.8 billion years ago. However, if the rings are made of leftovers from that process, then they‟d also be about
4.8 billion years old. The problem is that anything gathering space dust for that long would certainly have darkened
by now.
But Saturn‟s rings, most of them anyway, are pristine, so bright and shiny that they make Saturn “the jewel of the
solar system”. So the hypothesis that the rings are just made of material left over from the time of planetary
formation. That hypothesis must be wrong. Saturn‟s rings are much younger than the planet itself. They may have
formed only a few hundred million years ago, around the time the earliest dinosaurs lived on earth. We realize now
that the ring particles, which range in size from microscopic dust to boulders, bigger than large houses, well, a lot of
these particles are eventually lost. Then we believed they gradually spiral down out of the rings and into the planet‟s
atmosphere. This occurs as a result of the planet‟s gravity. And also because of the effects of its magnetic field.
Now, if material from Saturn‟s rings is being lost, and nothing new is added from time to time, the rings would be
disappearing, but that‟s not happening. So somehow, there must be new material feeding the ring system. Question
is, where is this new material coming from? So, we‟re back to square one. But, instead of asking how did the rings
form, we should be asking… anyone? Beth?
Student: How do the rings form?
Professor: How do the rings form! Because they are apparently replenishing themselves somehow. OK, here is one
possibility. The moons, the dozens of moons, they all orbit Saturn, are providing raw material for the rings.
A moon in the system is complex at Saturn‟s, and Saturn has at least 49 known moons which vary tremendously in
size and shape. A moon in such a complex system, is not only affected by the gravitational force of the planet, but
also by that of the other moons.
Student: So the planet may be pulling a moon one way, and other moons may be pulling it other ways?
Professor: Exactly. Such forces could actually alter a moon's orbit, and as a result there might be a collision when
moon might crash into another. And the debris from that collision could become part of the rings. Then there are
tidal forces, a moon might get too close to the planet and get broken apart by Saturn's tidal forces.
Student: Excuse me! You mean, tidal force is like high tide and low tide on the oceans?
)
Professor: Well, by tidal force, I'm referring to the gravitational pull of Saturn on its moons. In the mid-1800s, a
French scientist named Edouard Roche was studying the effects of a planet's tidal forces on its moons.Roche was
able to show mathematically that if one celestial body, say a moon, if it passes too close to another, say a planet, that
has a gravitational force stronger than the force of self-attraction that holds the moon together.
Well, that first body，that moon， it'd be ripped apart. We call the distance at which this happens the "Roche
limit". So if one of Saturn's moons reaches the Roche limit of the planet, or even a larger moon, it would
disintegrate, be torn apart and thus add more material to the ring system.
And there's another way new material might be added to the Saturn's rings, an asteroid crashing into one of the
moons. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that some of the many rings are a bit reddish in color. Yes, George?
Student: I'm sorry, I don't follow the logic.
Professor: Well, this reddish coloration suggests the presence of complex organic molecules, carbon-based
molecules, mixed in with the water ice. Remember, the rest of Saturn's rings are made almost entirely of water
ice. And none of Saturn's moons is red. But asteroids could be. And thus could end up contributing to the ring
system, the kind of carbon-based molecules we're talking about.

SCIENCE
16 – 2 Development of the Periodic Table
The periodic table is a chart that reflects the
periodic recurrence of chemical and physical
properties of the elements when the elements are
arranged in order of increasing atomic number (the
number of protons in the nucleus). It is a
monumental scientific achievement, and its
development illustrates the essential interplay
between observation, prediction, and testing
required for scientific progress. In the 1800s
scientists were searching for new elements. By the
late 1860s more than 60 chemical elements had
been identified, and much was known about their
descriptive chemistry. Various proposals were put
forth to arrange the elements into groups based on
similarities in chemical and physical properties. The
next step was to recognize a connection between
group properties (physical or chemical similarities)
and atomic mass (the measured mass of an
individual atom of an element). When the elements
known at the time were ordered by increasing
atomic mass, it was found that successive
elements belonged to different chemical groups
and that the order of the groups in this sequence
was fixed and repeated itself at regular intervals.
Thus when the series of elements was written so
as to begin a new horizontal row with each alkali
metal, elements of the same groups were
automatically assembled in vertical columns in a
periodic table of the elements. This table was the
forerunner of the modern table.
When the German chemist Lothar Meyer and
(independently) the Russian Dmitry Mendeleyev
first introduced the periodic table in 1869—70, onethird of the naturally occurring chemical elements
had not yet been discovered. Yet both chemists
were sufficiently farsighted to leave gaps where
their analyses of periodic physical and chemical
properties indicated that new elements should be
located. Mendeleyev was bolder than Meyer and
even assumed that if a measured atomic mass put
an element in the wrong place in the table, the
atomic mass was wrong. In some cases this was
true. Indium, for example, had previously been
assigned an atomic mass between those of arsenic
and selenium. Because there is no space in the
periodic table between these two elements,
Mendeleyev suggested that the atomic mass of
indium be changed to a completely different value,
where it would fill an empty space between
cadmium and tin. In fact, subsequent work has
shown that in a periodic table, elements should not
be ordered strictly by atomic mass. For example,
tellurium comes before iodine in the periodic table,
even though its atomic mass is slightly greater.
Such anomalies are due to the relative abundance
of the "isotopes" or varieties of each element. All
the isotopes of a given element have the same
number of protons, but differ in their number of
neutrons, and hence in their atomic mass. The
isotopes of a given element have the same
chemical properties but slightly different physical
properties. We now know that atomic number (the
number of protons in the nucleus), not atomic mass
number (the number of protons and neutrons),
determines chemical behavior.
Mendeleyev went further than Meyer in another
respect: he predicted the properties of six elements
yet to be discovered. For example, a gap just
below aluminum suggested a new element would
be found with properties analogous to those of
aluminum. Mendeleyev designated this element
"eka-aluminum" (eka is the Sanskrit word for
"next") and predicted its properties. Just five years
later an element with the proper atomic mass was
isolated and named gallium by its discoverer. The
close correspondence between the observed
properties of gallium and Mendeleyev's predictions
for eka-aluminum lent strong support to the periodic
law. Additional support came in 1885 when ekasilicon, which had also been described in advance
by Mendeleyev, was discovered and named
germanium.
The structure of the periodic table appeared to limit
the number of possible elements. It was therefore
quite surprising when John William Strut (Lord
Rayleigh), discovered a gaseous element in 1894
that did not fit into the previous classification
scheme. A century earlier, Henry Cavendish had
noted the existence of a residual gas when oxygen
and nitrogen are removed from air, but its
importance had not been realized. Together with
William Ramsay, Rayleigh isolated the gas
(separating it from other substances into its pure
state) and named it argon. Ramsay then studied a
gas that was present in natural gas deposits and
discovered that it was helium, an element whose
presence in the Sun had been noted earlier in the
spectrum of sunlight but that had not previously
been known on Earth. Rayleigh and Ramsay
postulated the existence of a new group of
elements, and in 1898 other members of the series
(neon, krypton, and xenon) were isolated.

37 – 1 Thales and the Milesians
While many other observers and thinkers had laid
the groundwork for science, Thales (circa 624
B.C.E.-ca 547 B.C.E.), the best known of the
earliest Greek philosophers, made the first steps
toward a new, more objective approach to finding
out about the world. He posed a very basic
question: "What is the world made of?" Many
others had asked the same question before him,
but Thales based his answer strictly on what he
had observed and what he could reason out-not on
imaginative stories about the gods or the
supernatural. He proposed water as the single
substance from which everything in the world was
made and developed a model of the universe with
Earth as a flat disk floating in water.
Like most of the great Greek philosophers, Thales
had an influence on others around him. His two
best-known followers, though there were
undoubtedly others who attained less renown, were
Anaximander and Anaximenes. Both were also
from Miletus (located on the southern coast of
present-day Turkey) and so, like Thales, were
members of the Milesian School. Much more is
known about Anaximander than about
Anaximenes, probably because Anaximander, who
was born sometime around 610 B.C.E., ambitiously
attempted to write a comprehensive history of the
universe. As would later happen between another
teacher-student pair of philosophers, Plato and
Aristotle, Anaximander disagreed with his teacher
despite his respect for him. He doubted that the
world and all its contents could be made of water
and proposed instead a formless and unobservable
substance he called "apeiron" that was the source
of all matter.
Anaximander's most important contributions,
though, were in other areas. Although he did not
accept that water was the prime element, he did
believe that all life originated in the sea, and he
was thus one of the first to conceive of this
important idea. Anaximander is credited with
drawing up the first world map of the Greeks and
also with recognizing that Earth's surface was
curved. He believed, though, that the shape of
Earth was that of a cylinder rather than the sphere
that later Greek philosophers would conjecture.
Anaximander, observing the motions of the
heavens around the polestar, was probably the first
of the Greek philosophers to picture the sky as
sphere completely surrounding Earth-an idea that,
elaborated upon later, would prevail until the
advent of the Scientific Revolution in the
seventeenth century.
Unfortunately, most of Anaximander's written
history of the universe was lost, and only a few
fragments survive today. Little is known about his
other ideas. Unfortunately, too, most of the written
work for Anaximenes, who may have been
Anaximander's pupil, has also been lost. All we can
say for certain about Anaximenes, who was
probably born around 560 B.C.E., is that following
in the tradition of Anaximander, he also disagreed
with his mentor. The world, according to
Anaximenes, was not composed of either water or
apeiron, but air itself was the fundamental element
of the universe. Compressed, it became water and
earth, and when rarefied or thinned out, it heated
up to become fire. Anaximenes may have also
been the first to study rainbows and speculate
upon their natural rather than supernatural cause.
With the door opened by Thales and the other early
philosophers of Milestus, Greek thinkers began to
speculate about the nature of the universe. This
exciting burst of intellectual activity was for the
most part purely creative. The Greeks, from Thales
to Plato and Aristotle, were philosophers and not
scientists in today's sense. It is possible for anyone
to create "ideas" about the nature and structure of
the universe, for instance, and many times these
ideas can be so consistent and elaborately
structured, or just so apparently obvious, that they
can be persuasive to many people. A scientific
theory about the universe, however, demands
much more than the various observations and
analogies that were woven together to form
systems of reasoning, carefully constructed as they
were, that would eventually culminate in Aristotle's
model of the world and the universe. Without
experimentation and objective, critical testing of
their theories, the best these thinkers could hope to
achieve was some internally consistent speculation
that covered all the bases and satisfied the
demands of reason.

37 – 1 Microscopes
Before microscopes were first used in the
seventeenth century, no one knew that living
organisms were composed of cells. The first
microscopes were light microscopes, which work
by passing visible light through a specimen. Glass
lenses in the microscope bend the light to magnify
the image of the specimen and project the image
into the viewer's eye or onto photographic film.
Light microscopes can magnify objects up to 1,000
times without causing blurriness.
Magnification, the increase in the apparent size of
an object, is one important factor in microscopy.
Also important is resolving power, a measure of the
clarity of an image. Resolving power is the ability of
an optical instrument to show two objects as
separate. For example, what looks to the unaided
eye like a single star in the sky may be resolved as
two stars with the help of a telescope. Any optical
device is limited by its resolving power. The light
microscope cannot resolve detail finer than 0.2
micrometers, about the size of the smallest
bacterium; consequently, no matter how many
times its image of such a bacterium is magnified,
the light microscope cannot show the details of the
cell's internal structure.
From the year 1665, when English microscopist
Robert Hooke discovered cells, until the middle of
the twentieth century, biologists had only light
microscopes for viewing cells. But they discovered
a great deal, including the cells composing animal
and plant tissues, microscopic organisms, and
some of the structures within cells. By the mid1800s, these discoveries led to the cell theory,
which states that all living things are composed of
cells and that all cells come from other cells.
Our knowledge of cell structure took a giant leap
forward as biologists began using the electron
microscope in the 1950s. Instead of light, the
electron microscope uses a beam of electrons and
has a much higher resolving power than the light
microscope. In fact, the most powerful modern
electron microscopes can distinguish objects as
small as 0.2 nanometers, a thousandfold
improvement over the light microscope. The period
at the end of this sentence is about a million times
bigger than an object 0.2 nanometers in diameter,
which is the size of a large atom. Only under
special conditions can electron microscopes detect
individual atoms. However, cells, cellular
organelles, and even molecules like DNA and
protein are much larger than single atoms.
Biologists use the scanning electron microscope to
study the detailed architecture of cell surfaces. It
uses an electron beam to scan the surface of a cell
or group of cells that have been coated with metal.
The metal stops the beam from going through the
cells. When the metal is hit by the beam, it emits
electrons. The electrons are focused to form an
image of the outside of the cells. The scanning
electron microscope produces images that look
three-dimensional.
The transmission electron microscope, on the other
hands, is used to study the details of internal cell
structure. Specimens are cut into extremely thin
sections, and the transmission electron microscope
aims an electron beam through a section, just as a
light microscope aims a beam of light through a
specimen. However, instead of lenses made of
glass, the transmission electron microscope uses
electromagnets as lenses, as do all electron
microscopes. The electromagnets bend the
electron beam to magnify and focus an image onto
a viewing screen or photographic film.
Electron microscopes have truly revolutionized the
study of cells and cell organelles. Nonetheless,
they have not replaced the light microscope. One
problem with electron microscopes is that they
cannot be used to study living specimens because
the specimen must be held in a vacuum chamber;
that is, all the air and liquid must be removed. For a
biologist studying a living process, such as the
whirling movement of a bacterium, a light
microscope equipped with a video camera might be
better than either a scanning electron microscope
or a transmission electron microscope. Thus, the
light microscope remains a useful tool, especially
for studying living cells. The size of a cell often
determines the type of microscope a biologist uses
to study it.

ENERGY / INDUSTRY /
TECHNOLOGY
06 – 1 Powering the Industrial Revolution
In Britain one of the most dramatic changes of the
Industrial Revolution was the harnessing of power.
Until the reign of George Ⅲ (1760 – 1820),
available sources of power for work and travel had
not increased since the Middle Ages. There were
three sources of power: animal or human muscles;
the wind, operating on sail or windmill; and running
water. Only the last of these was suited at all to the
continuous operating of machines, and although
waterpower abounded in Lancashire and Scotland
and ran grain mills as well as textile mills, it had
one great disadvantage: streams flowed where
nature intended them to, and water-driven factories
had to be located on their banks whether or not the
location was desirable for other reasons.
Furthermore, even the most reliable waterpower
varied with the seasons and disappeared in a
drought. The new age of machinery, in short, could
not have been born without a new source of both
movable and constant power.
The source had long been known but not exploited.
Early in the eighteenth century, a pump had come
into use in which expanding steam raised a piston
in a cylinder, and atmospheric pressure brought it
down again when the steam condensed inside the
cylinder to form a vacuum. This “atmospheric
engine,” invented by Thomas Savery and vastly
improved by his partner, Thomas Newcomen,
embodied revolutionary principles, but it was so
slow and wasteful of fuel that it could not be
employed outside the coal mines for which it had
been designed. In the 1760s, James Watt
perfected a separate condenser for the steam, so
that the cylinder did not have to be cooled at every
stroke; then he devised a way to make the piston
turn a wheel and thus convert reciprocating (back
and forth) motion into rotary motion. He thereby
transformed an inefficient pump of limited use into
a steam engine of a thousand uses. The final step
came when steam was introduced into the cylinder
to drive the piston backward as well as forward,
thereby increasing the speed of the engine and
cutting its fuel consumption.
Watt's steam engine soon showed what it could do.
It liberated industry from dependence on running
water. The engine eliminated water in the mines by
driving efficient pumps, which made possible
deeper and deeper mining. The ready availability of
coal inspired William Murdoch during the 1790s to
develop the first new form of nighttime illumination
to be discovered in a millennium and a half. Coal
gas rivaled smoky oil lamps and flickering candles,
and early in the new century, well-to-do Londoners
grew accustomed to gaslit houses and even
streets. Iron manufacturers, which had starved for
fuel while depending on charcoal, also benefited
from ever-increasing supplies of coal: blast
furnaces with steam-powered bellows turned out
more iron and steel for the new machinery. Steam
became the motive force of the Industrial
Revolution as coal and iron ore were the raw
materials.
By 1800 more than a thousand steam engines
were in use in the British Isles, and Britain retained
a virtual monopoly on steam engine production
until the 1830s. Steam power did not merely spin
cotton and roll iron; early in the new century, it also
multiplied ten times over the amount of paper that a
single worker could produce in a day. At the same
time, operators of the first printing presses run by
steam rather than by hand found it possible to
produce a thousand pages in an hour rather than
thirty. Steam also promised to eliminate a
transportation problem not fully solved by either
canal boats or turnpikes. Boats could carry heavy
weights, but canals could not cross hilly terrain;
turnpikes could cross the hills, but the roadbeds
could not stand up under great weights. These
problems needed still another solution, and the
ingredients for it lay close at hand. In some
industrial regions, heavily laden wagons, with
flanged wheels, were being hauled by horses along
metal rails; and the stationary steam engine was
puffing in the factory and mine. Another generation
passed before inventors succeeded in combining
these ingredients, by putting the engine on wheels
and the wheels on the rails, so as to provide a
machine to take the place of the horse. Thus the
railroad age sprang from what had already
happened in the eighteenth century.

71 – 1 Electrical Energy from the Ocean
Solar energy reaching Earth is responsible for
differential heating of the atmosphere and thus air
circulation as wind.Some of the energy of wind is
transferred to the oceans, where it causes waves
and is partly responsible for oceanic currents,
although Earth's rotation also plays a role in
currents Gravitational attraction between Earth and
the Sun and Moon generates tides and,along with
Earth's rotation, causes most coastal areas to
experience a twice-daily rise and fall of sea level In
short, the oceans possess a tremendous reservoir
of largely untapped energy.
If we could effectively harness the energy
possessed by the oceans, an almost limitless,
largely nonpolluting energy supply would be
ensured. Unfortunately, ocean energy is diffuse,
meaning that the amount of energy for a given
volume of water is small and thus difficult to
concentrate and use. Several ways of using ocean
energy are being considered or are under
development, and one is currently in use, although
it accounts for only a tiny proportion of all energy
production. Of the several sources of ocean
energy-temperature differences with depth,
currents, waves, and tides-only the last shows
much promise for the near future.
Ocean water at depth might be as much as 25° C
colder than surface water, a difference that allows
for ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC).
OTEC exploits this temperature difference to run
turbines and generate electricity.The amount of
energy available is enormous, but a number of
practical problems must be solved before it can be
used For one thing, any potential site must be
close to land and also have a sufficiently rapid
change with depth to result in the required
Temperature difference. Furthermore, enormous
quantities of warm and cold seawater would have
to circulate through an electrical-generating plant,
thus requiring that large surface areas be devoted
to this purpose.
The concept of OTEC is more than a century old,
but despite several decades of research, no
commercial OTEC plants are operating or even
under construction, although small experimental
ones have been tested in Hawaii and Japan.
Wind-generated ocean currents, such as the Gulf
Stream,which flows along the east coast of North
America,also possess energy that might be tapped
to generate electricity.Unlike streams that can be
dammed to impound a reservoir, any electrical
generating facility exploiting oceanic currents would
have to concentrate currents' diffuse energy and
contend with any unpredictable changes in
direction. In addition, whereas hydroelectric
generating plants on land depend on the rapid
movement of water from a higher elevation to the
turbines, the energy of ocean currents comes from
their flow velocity, which is at most a few kilometers
per hour.
The most obvious form of energy in the oceans lies
in waves. Harnessing wave energy and converting
it to electricity is not a new idea, and it has been
used on an extremely limited scale. Unfortunately,
the energy possessed by a wave is distributed
along its crest and is difficult to concentrate.
Furthermore, any facility would have to be
designed to withstand the effects of storms and
saltwater corrosion. The Japanese have developed
wave-energy devices to power lighthouses and
buoys, and a facility capable of providing power to
about 300 homes began operating in Scotland
during September 2000.
Perhaps tidal power is the most promising form of
ocean energy. In fact, it has been used for
centuries in some coastal areas to run mills, but its
use at present for electrical generation is limited.
Most coastal areas experience a twice-daily rise
and fall of tides, but only a few areas are suitable
for exploiting this energy source. One limitation is
that the tidal range must be at least five meters,
and there must also be a coastal region where
water can be stored following high tide.
Suitable sites for using tidal power are limiled not
only by tidal range but also by location. Many areas
along the U. S. Gulf Coast would certainly benefit
from lidal power plants, but a tide range of
generally less than one meter precludes the
possibility of development. Even areas with an
appropriate tidal range such as the Arctic islands of
Canada offer little potential because of their great
distances from population centers.

04 – 3 Petroleum Resources
Petroleum, consisting of crude oil and natural gas,
seems to originate from organic matter in marine
sediment. Microscopic organisms settle to the
seafloor and accumulate in marine mud. The
organic matter may partially decompose, using up
the dissolved oxygen in the sediment. As soon as
the oxygen is gone, decay stops and the remaining
organic matter is preserved.
Continued sedimentation—the process of deposits'
settling on the sea bottom—buries the organic
matter and subjects it to higher temperatures and
pressures, which convert the organic matter to oil
and gas. As muddy sediments are pressed
together, the gas and small droplets of oil may be
squeezed out of the mud and may move into sandy
layers nearby. Over long periods of time (millions of
years), accumulations of gas and oil can collect in
the sandy layers. Both oil and gas are less dense
than water, so they generally tend to rise upward
through water-saturated rock and sediment.
Oil pools are valuable underground accumulations
of oil, and oil fields are regions underlain by one or
more oil pools. When an oil pool or field has been
discovered, wells are drilled into the ground.
Permanent towers, called derricks, used to be built
to handle the long sections of drilling pipe. Now
portable drilling machines are set up and are then
dismantled and removed. When the well reaches a
pool, oil usually rises up the well because of its
density difference with water beneath it or because
of the pressure of expanding gas trapped above it.
Although this rise of oil is almost always carefully
controlled today, spouts of oil, or gushers, were
common in the past. Gas pressure gradually dies
out, and oil is pumped from the well. Water or
steam may be pumped down adjacent wells to help
push the oil out. At a refinery, the crude oil from
underground is separated into natural gas,
gasoline, kerosene, and various oils.
Petrochemicals such as dyes, fertilizer, and plastic
are also manufactured from the petroleum.
As oil becomes increasingly difficult to find, the
search for it is extended into more-hostile
environments. The development of the oil field on
the North Slope of Alaska and the construction of
the Alaska pipeline are examples of the great
expense and difficulty involved in new oil
discoveries. Offshore drilling platforms extend the
search for oil to the ocean’s continental shelves—
those gently sloping submarine regions at the
edges of the continents. More than one-quarter of
the world’s oil and almost one-fifth of the world’s
natural gas come from offshore, even though
offshore drilling is six to seven times more
expensive than drilling on land. A significant part of
this oil and gas comes from under the North Sea
between Great Britain and Norway.
Of course, there is far more oil underground than
can be recovered. It may be in a pool too small or
too far from a potential market to justify the
expense of drilling. Some oil lies under regions
where drilling is forbidden, such as national parks
or other public lands. Even given the best
extraction techniques, only about 30 to 40 percent
of the oil in a given pool can be brought to the
surface. The rest is far too difficult to extract and
has to remain underground.
Moreover, getting petroleum out of the ground and
from under the sea and to the consumer can create
environmental problems anywhere along the line.
Pipelines carrying oil can be broken by faults or
landslides, causing serious oil spills. Spillage from
huge oil-carrying cargo ships, called tankers,
involved in collisions or accidental groundings
(such as the one off Alaska in 1989) can create oil
slicks at sea. Offshore platforms may also lose oil,
creating oil slicks that drift ashore and foul the
beaches, harming the environment. Sometimes,
the ground at an oil field may subside as oil is
removed. The Wilmington field near Long Beach,
California, has subsided nine meters in 50 years;
protective barriers have had to be built to prevent
seawater from flooding the area. Finally, the
refining and burning of petroleum and its products
can cause air pollution. Advancing technology and
strict laws, however, are helping control some of
these adverse environmental effects.

18 – 1 Industrialization in the Netherlands and
Scandinavia
While some European countries, such as England
and Germany, began to industrialize in the
eighteenth century, the Netherlands and the
Scandinavian countries of Denmark, Norway, and
Sweden developed later. All four of these countries
lagged considerably behind in the early nineteenth
century. However, they industrialized rapidly in the
second half of the century, especially in the last two
or three decades. In view of their later start and
their lack of coal—undoubtedly the main reason
they were not among the early industrializers—it is
important to understand the sources of their
success.
All had small populations. At the beginning of the
nineteenth century, Denmark and Norway had
fewer than 1 million people, while Sweden and the
Netherlands had fewer than 2.5 million inhabitants.
All exhibited moderate growth rates in the course of
the century (Denmark the highest and Sweden the
lowest), but all more than doubled in population by
1900. Density varied greatly. The Netherlands had
one of the highest population densities in Europe,
whereas Norway and Sweden had the lowest.
Denmark was in between but closer to the
Netherlands.
Considering human capital as a characteristic of
the population, however, all four countries were
advantaged by the large percentages of their
populations who could read and write. In both 1850
and 1914, the Scandinavian countries had the
highest literacy rates in Europe, or in the world, and
the Netherlands was well above the European
average. This fact was of enormous value in
helping the national economies find their niches in
the evolving currents of the international economy.
Location was an important factor for all four
countries. All had immediate access to the sea,
and this had important implications for a significant
international resource, fish, as well as for cheap
transport, merchant marines, and the shipbuilding
industry. Each took advantage of these
opportunities in its own way. The people of the
Netherlands, with a long tradition of fisheries and
mercantile shipping, had difficulty in developing
good harbors suitable for steamships: eventually
they did so at Rotterdam and Amsterdam, with
exceptional results for transit trade with Germany
and central Europe and for the processing of
overseas foodstuffs and raw materials (sugar,
tobacco, chocolate, grain, and eventually oil).
Denmark also had an admirable commercial
history, particularly with respect to traffic through
the Sound (the strait separating Denmark and
Sweden). In 1857, in return for a payment of 63
million kronor from other commercial nations,
Denmark abolished the Sound toll dues, the fees it
had collected since 1497 for the use of the Sound.
This, along with other policy shifts toward free
trade, resulted in a significant increase in traffic
through the Sound and in the port of Copenhagen.
The political institutions of the four countries posed
no significant barriers to industrialization or
economic growth. The nineteenth century passed
relatively peacefully for these countries, with
progressive democratization taking place in all of
them. They were reasonably well governed, without
notable corruption or grandiose state projects,
although in all of them the government gave some
aid to railways, and in Sweden the state built the
main lines. As small countries dependent on
foreign markets, they followed a liberal trade policy
in the main, though a protectionist movement
developed in Sweden. In Denmark and Sweden
agricultural reforms took place gradually from the
late eighteenth century through the first half of the
nineteenth, resulting in a new class of peasant
landowners with a definite market orientation.
The key factor in the success of these countries
(along with high literacy, which contributed to it)
was their ability to adapt to the international
division of labor determined by the early
industrializers and to stake out areas of
specialization in international markets for which
they were especially well suited. This meant a great
dependence on international commerce, which had
notorious fluctuations; but it also meant high
returns to those factors of production that were
fortunate enough to be well placed in times of
prosperity. In Sweden exports accounted for 18
percent of the national income in 1870, and in
1913, 22 percent of a much larger national income.
In the early twentieth century, Denmark exported
63 percent of its agricultural production: butter,
pork products, and eggs. It exported 80 percent of
its butter, almost all to Great Britain, where it
accounted for 40 percent of British butter imports.

21 – 1 Geothermal Energy
Earth’s internal heat, fueled by radioactivity,
provides the energy for plate tectonics and
continental drift, mountain building, and
earthquakes. It can also be harnessed to drive
electric generators and heat homes. Geothermal
energy becomes available in a practical form when
underground heat is transferred by water that is
heated as it passes through a subsurface region of
hot rocks (a heat reservoir) that may be hundreds
or thousands of feet deep. The water is usually
naturally occurring groundwater that seeps down
along fractures in the rock; less typically, the water
is artificially introduced by being pumped down
from the surface. The water is brought to the
surface, as a liquid or steam, through holes drilled
for the purpose.
By far the most abundant form of geothermal
energy occurs at the relatively low temperatures of
80° to 180° centigrade. Water circulated through
heat reservoirs in this temperature range is able to
extract enough heat to warm residential,
commercial, and industrial spaces. More than
20,000 apartments in France are now heated by
warm underground water drawn from a heat
reservoir in a geologic structure near Paris called
the Paris Basin. Iceland sits on a volcanic structure
known as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Reykjavik, the
capital of Iceland, is entirely heated by geothermal
energy derived from volcanic heat.
Geothermal reservoirs with temperatures above
180° centigrade are useful for generating
electricity. They occur primarily in regions of recent
volcanic activity as hot, dry rock; natural hot water;
or natural steam. The latter two sources are limited
to those few areas where surface water seeps
down through underground faults or fractures to
reach deep rocks heated by the recent activity of
molten rock material. The world’s largest supply of
natural steam occurs at The Geysers, 120
kilometers north of San Francisco, California. In the
1990s enough electricity to meet about half the
needs of San Francisco was being generated
there. This facility was then in its third decade of
production and was beginning to show signs of
decline, perhaps because of over development. By
the late 1990s some 70 geothermal electricgenerating plants were in operation in California,
Utah, Nevada, and Hawaii, generating enough
power to supply about a million people. Eighteen
countries now generate electricity using geothermal
heat.
Extracting heat from very hot, dry rocks presents a
more difficult problem: the rocks must be fractured
to permit the circulation of water, and the water
must be provided artificially. The rocks are
fractured by water pumped down at very high
pressures. Experiments are under way to develop
technologies for exploiting this resource.
Like most other energy sources, geothermal energy
presents some environmental problems. The
surface of the ground can sink if hot groundwater is
withdrawn without being replaced. In addition,
water heated geothermally can contain salts and
toxic materials dissolved from the hot rock. These
waters present a disposal problem if they are not
returned to the ground from which they were
removed.
The contribution of geothermal energy to the
world’s energy future is difficult to estimate.
Geothermal energy is in a sense not renewable,
because in most cases the heat would be drawn
out of a reservoir much more rapidly than it would
be replaced by the very slow geological processes
by which heat flows through solid rock into a heat
reservoir. However, in many places (for example,
California, Hawaii, the Philippines, Japan, Mexico,
the rift valleys of Africa) the resource is potentially
so large that its future will depend on the
economics of production. At present, we can make
efficient use of only naturally occurring hot water or
steam deposits. Although the potential is
enormous, it is likely that in the near future
geothermal energy can make important local
contributions only where the resource is close to
the user and the economics are favorable, as they
are in California, New Zealand, and Iceland.
Geothermal energy probably will not make largescale contributions to the world energy budget until
well into the twenty-first century, if ever.

26 – 1 Energy and the Industrial Revolution
For years historians have sought to identify crucial
elements in the eighteenth-century rise in industry,
technology, and economic power known as the
Industrial Revolution, and many give prominence to
the problem of energy. Until the eighteenth century,
people relied on energy derived from plants as well
as animal and human muscle to provide power.
Increased efficiency in the use of water and wind
helped with such tasks as pumping, milling, or
sailing. However, by the eighteenth century, Great
Britain in particular was experiencing an energy
shortage. Wood, the primary source of heat for
homes and industries and also used in the iron
industry as processed charcoal, was diminishing in
supply.Great Britain had large amounts of coal;
however, there were not yet efficient means by
which to produce mechanical energy or to power
machinery. This was to occur with progress in the
development of the steam engine.
In the late 1700s James Watt designed an efficient
and commercially viable steam engine that was
soon applied to a variety of industrial uses as it
became cheaper to use. The engine helped solve
the problem of draining coal mines of groundwater
and increased the production of coal needed to
power steam engines elsewhere. A rotary engine
attached to the steam engine enabled shafts to be
turned and machines to be driven, resulting in mills
using steam power to spin and weave cotton. Since
the steam engine was fired by coal, the large mills
did not need to be located by rivers, as had mills
that used water-driven machines. The shift to
increased mechanization in cotton production is
apparent in the import of raw cotton and the sale of
cotton goods. Between 1760 and 1850, the amount
of raw cotton imported increased 230 times.
Production of British cotton goods increased
sixtyfold, and cotton cloth became Great Britain’s
most important product, accounting for one-half of
all exports. The success of the steam engine
resulted in increased demands for coal, and the
consequent increase in coal production was made
possible as the steam-powered pumps drained
water from the ever-deeper coal seams found
below the water table.
The availability of steam power and the demands
for new machines facilitated the transformation of
the iron industry. Charcoal, made from wood and
thus in limited supply, was replaced with coalderived coke (substance left after coal is heated)
as steam-driven bellows came into use for
producing of raw iron. Impurities were burnt away
with the use of coke, producing a high-quality
refined iron. Reduced cost was also instrumental in
developing steam-powered rolling mills capable of
producing finished iron of various shapes and
sizes. The resulting boom in the iron industry
expanded the annual iron output by more than 170
times between 1740 and 1840, and by the 1850s
Great Britain was producing more tons of iron than
the rest of the world combined. The developments
in the iron industry were in part a response to the
demand for more machines and the ever-widening
use of higher-quality iron in other industries.
Steam power and iron combined to revolutionize
transport, which in turn had further implications.
Improvements in road construction and sailing had
occurred, but shipping heavy freight over land
remained expensive, even with the use of rivers
and canals wherever possible. Parallel rails had
long been used in mining operations to move
bigger loads, but horses were still the primary
source of power. However, the arrival of the steam
engine initiated a complete transformation in rail
transportation, entrenching and expanding the
Industrial Revolution. As transportation improved,
distant and larger markets within the nation could
be reached, thereby encouraging the development
of larger factories to keep pace with increasing
sales. Greater productivity and rising demands
provided entrepreneurs with profits that could be
reinvested to take advantage of new technologies
to further expand capacity, or to seek alternative
investment opportunities. Also, the availability of
jobs in railway construction attracted many rural
laborers accustomed to seasonal and temporary
employment. When the work was completed, many
moved to other construction jobs or to factory work
in cities and towns, where they became part of an
expanding working class.

29 – 3 The History of Waterpower
Moving water was one of the earliest energy
sources to be harnessed to reduce the workload of
people and animals. No one knows exactly when
the waterwheel was invented, but irrigation systems
existed at least 5,000 years ago, and it seems
probable that the earliest waterpower device was
the noria, a waterwheel that raised water for
irrigation in attached jars. The device appears to
have evolved no later than the fifth century B.C.,
perhaps independently in different regions of the
Middle and Far East.
The earliest waterpower mills were probably
vertical-axis mills for grinding corn, known as Norse
or Greek mills, which seem to have appeared
during the first or second century B.C. in the Middle
East and a few centuries later in Scandinavia. In
the following centuries, increasingly sophisticated
waterpower mills were built throughout the Roman
Empire and beyond its boundaries in the Middle
East and northern Europe. In England, the Saxons
are thought to have used both horizontal-axis and
vertical-axis wheels. The first documented English
mill was in the eighth century, but three centuries
later about 5,000 were recorded, suggesting that
every settlement of any size had its mill.
Raising water and grinding corn were by no means
the only uses of the waterpower mill, and during
the following centuries, the applications of
waterpower kept pace with the developing
technologies of mining, iron working, paper making,
and the wool and cotton industries. Water was the
main source of mechanical power, and by the end
of the seventeenth century, England alone is
thought to have had some 20,000 working mill.
There was much debate on the relative efficiencies
of different types of waterwheels. The period from
about 1650 until 1800 saw some excellent scientific
and technical investigations of different designs.
They revealed output powers ranging from about 1
horsepower to perhaps 60 for the largest wheels
and confirmed that for maximum efficiency, the
water should pass across the blades as smoothly
as possible and fall away with minimum speed,
having given up almost all of its kinetic energy.
(They also proved that, in principle, the overshot
wheel, a type of wheel in which an overhead
stream of water powers the wheel, should win the
efficiency competition.)
But then steam power entered the scene, putting
the whole future of waterpower in doubt. An energy
analyst writing in the year 1800 would have painted
a very pessimistic picture of the future for
waterpower. The coal-fired steam engine was
taking over, and the waterwheel was fast becoming
obsolete. However, like many later experts, this
one would have suffered from an inability to see
into the future. A century later the picture was
completely different: by then, the world had an
electric industry, and a quarter of its generating
capacity was water powered.
11
30 – 3 The Invention of the Mechanical Clock
In Europe, before the introduction of the
mechanical clock, people told time by sun (using,
for example, shadow sticks or sun dials) and water
clocks. Sun clocks worked, of course, only on clear
days; water clocks misbehaved when the
temperature fell toward freezing, to say nothing of
long-run drift as the result of sedimentation and
clogging. Both these devices worked well in sunny
climates; but in northern Europe the sun may be
hidden by clouds for weeks at a time, while
temperatures vary not only seasonally but from day
to night.
Medieval Europe gave new importance to reliable
time. The Catholic Church had its seven daily
prayers, one of which was at night, requiring an
alarm arrangement to waken monks before dawn.
And then the new cities and towns, squeezed by
their walls, had to know and order time in order to
organize collective activity and ration space. They
set a time to go to work, to open the market , to
close the market, to leave work, and finally a time
to put out fires and to go to sleep. All this was
compatible with older devices so long as there was
only one authoritative timekeeper; but with urban
growth and the multiplication of time signals,
discrepancy brought discord and strife. Society
needed a more dependable instrument of time
measurement and found it in the mechanical clock.
We do not know who invented this machine, or
where. It seems to have appeared in Italy and
England (perhaps simultaneous invention) between
1275 and 1300. Once known, it spread rapidly,
driving out water clocks but not solar dials, which
were needed to check the new machines against
the timekeeper of last resort. These early versions
were rudimentary, inaccurate, and prone to
breakdown.
Ironically, the new machine tended to undermine
Catholic Church authority. Although church ritual
had sustained an interest in timekeeping
throughout the centuries of urban collapse that
followed the fall of Rome, church time was nature’s
time. Day and night were divided into the same
number of parts, so that except at the equinoxes,
days and night hours were unequal; and then of
course the length of these hours varied with the
seasons. But the mechanical clock kept equal
hours, and this implied a new time reckoning. The
Catholic Church resisted, not coming over to the
new hours for about a century. From the start,
however, the towns and cities took equal hours as
their standard, and the public clocks installed in
town halls and market squares became the very
symbol of a new, secular municipal authority. Every
town wanted one; conquerors seized them as
especially precious spoils of war; tourists came to
see and hear these machines the way they made
pilgrimages to sacred relics.
The clock was the greatest achievement of
medieval mechanical ingenuity. Its general
accuracy could be checked against easily observed
phenomena, like the rising and setting of the sun.
The result was relentless pressure to improve
technique and design. At every stage, clockmakers
led the way to accuracy and precision; they
became masters of miniaturization, detectors and
correctors of error, searchers for new and better.
They were thus the pioneers of mechanical
engineering and served as examples and teachers
to other branches of engineering.
The clock brought order and control, both collective
and personal. Its public display and private
possession laid the basis for temporal autonomy:
people could now coordinate comings and goings
without dictation from above. The clock provided
the punctuation marks for group activity, while
enabling individuals to order their own work (and
that of others) so as to enhance productivity.
Indeed, the very notion of productivity is a byproduct of the clock: once one can relate
performance to uniform time units, work is never
the same. One moves from the task-oriented time
consciousness of the peasant (working on job after
another, as time and light permit) and the timefilling busyness of the domestic servant (who
always had something to do) to an effort to
maximize product per unit of time.
12
34 – 2 The Development of Steam Power
By the eighteenth century, Britain was experiencing
a severe shortage of energy. Because of the
growth of population, most of the great forests of
medieval Britain had long ago been replaced by
fields of grain and hay. Wood was in ever-shorter
supply, yet it remained tremendously important. It
served as the primary source of heat for all homes
and industries and as a basic raw material.
Processed wood (charcoal) was the fuel that was
mixed with iron ore in the blast furnace to produce
pig iron (raw iron). The iron industry’s appetite for
wood was enormous, and by 1740 the British iron
industry was stagnating. Vast forests enabled
Russia to become the world’s leading producer of
iron, much of which was exported to Britain. But
Russia’s potential for growth was limited too, and in
a few decades Russia would reach the barrier of
inadequate energy that was already holding
England back.
As this early energy crisis grew worse, Britain
looked toward its abundant and widely scattered
reserves of coal as an alternative to its vanishing
wood. Coal was first used in Britain in the late
Middle Ages as a source of heat. By 1640 most
homes in London were heated with it, and it also
provided heat for making beer, glass, soap, and
other products. Coal was not used, however, to
produce mechanical energy or to power machinery.
It was there that coal’s potential was enormous.
As more coal was produced, mines were dug
deeper and deeper and were constantly filling with
water. Mechanical pumps, usually powered by
hundreds of horses walking in circles at the
surface, had to be installed. Such power was
expensive and bothersome. In an attempt to
overcome these disadvantages, Thomas Savery in
1698 and Thomas Newcomen in 1705 invented the
first primitive steam engines. Both engines were
extremely inefficient. Both burned coal to produce
steam, which was then used to operate a pump.
However, by the early 1770s, many of the Savery
engines and hundreds of the Newcomen engines
were operating successfully, though inefficiently, in
English and Scottish mines.
In the early 1760s, a gifted young Scot named
James Watt was drawn to a critical study of the
steam engine. Watt was employed at the time by
the University of Glasgow as a skilled crafts worker
making scientific instruments. In 1763, Watt was
called on to repair a Newcomen engine being used
in a physics course. After a series of observations,
Watt saw that the Newcomen’s waste of energy
could be reduced by adding a separate condenser.
This splendid invention, patented in 1769, greatly
increased the efficiency of the steam engine. The
steam engine of Watt and his followers was the
technological advance that gave people, at least for
a while, unlimited power and allowed the invention
and use of all kinds of power equipment.
The steam engine was quickly put to use in several
industries in Britain. It drained mines and made
possible the production of ever more coal to feed
steam engines elsewhere. The steam power plant
began to replace waterpower in the cotton-spinning
mills as well as other industries during the 1780s,
contributing to a phenomenal rise in
industrialization. The British iron industry was
radically transformed. The use of powerful, steamdriven bellows in blast furnaces helped iron makers
switch over rapidly from limited charcoal to
unlimited coke (which is made from coal) in the
smelting of pig iron (the process of refining impure
iron) after 1770. In the 1780s, Henry Cort
developed the puddling furnace, which allowed pig
iron to be refined in turn with coke. Cort also
developed heavy-duty, steam-powered rolling mills,
which were capable of producing finished iron in
every shape and form.
The economic consequence of these technical
innovations in steam power was a great boom in
the British iron industry. In 1740 annual British iron
production was only 17,000 tons, but by 1844, with
the spread of coke smelting and the impact of
Cort’s inventions, it had increased to 3,000,000
tons. This was a truly amazing expansion. Once
scarce and expensive, iron became cheap, basic,
and indispensable to the economy.

36 – 3 Industrial Melanism: The Case of the
Peppered Moth
The idea of natural selection is that organisms in a
species that have characteristics favoring survival
are most likely to survive and produce offspring
with the same characteristics. Because the survival
of organisms with particular characteristics is
favored over the survival of other organisms in the
same species that lack these characteristics, future
generations of the species are likely to include
more organisms with the favorable characteristics.
One of the most thoroughly analyzed examples of
natural selection in operation is the change in color
that has occurred in certain populations of the
peppered moth, Biston betularia, in industrial
regions of Europe during the past 100 years.
Originally moths were uniformly pale gray or whitish
in color; dark-colored (melanic) individuals were
rare and made up less than 2 percent of the
population. Over a period of decades, dark-colored
forms became an increasingly large fraction of
some populations and eventually came to dominate
peppered moth populations in certain areas—
especially those of extreme industrialization such
as the Ruhr Valley of Germany and the Midlands of
England. Coal from industry released large
amounts of black soot into the environment, but the
increase of the dark-colored forms was not due to
genetic mutations caused by industrial pollution.
For example, caterpillars that feed on soot-covered
leaves did not give rise to dark-colored adults.
Rather, pollution promoted the survival of dark
forms on soot-covered trees. Melanics were
normally quickly eliminated in nonindustrial areas
by adverse selection; birds spotted them easily.
This phenomenon, an increase in the frequency of
dark-colored mutants in polluted areas, is known as
industrial melanism. The North American
equivalent of this story is another moth, the
swettaria form of Biston cognataria, first noticed in
industrialized areas such as Chicago and New York
City in the early 1900s. By 1961 it constituted over
90 percent of the population in parts of Michigan.
The idea that natural selection was responsible for
the changing ratio of dark- to light-colored
peppered moths was developed in the 1950s by H.
B. D. Kettlewell of Oxford University. If natural
selection was the explanation, then there should be
different survival rates for dark- and light- colored
moths. To determine whether this was true,
Kettlewell released thousands of light and dark
moths (each marked with a paint spot) into rural
and industrialized areas. In the nonindustrial area
of Dorset, he recaptured 14.6 percent of the pale
forms but only 4.7 percent of the dark forms. In the
industrial area of Birmingham, the situation was
reversed: 13 percent of pale forms but 27.5 percent
of dark forms were recaptured.
Clearly some environmental factor was responsible
for the greater survival rates of dark moths. Birds
were predators of peppered moths. Kettlewell
hypothesized that the normal pale forms are
difficult to see when resting on lichen-covered
trees, whereas dark forms are conspicuous. In
industrialized areas, lichens are destroyed by
pollution, tree barks become darker, and dark
moths are the ones birds have difficulty detecting.
As a test, Kettlewell set up hidden observation
positions and watched birds voraciously eat moths
placed on tree trunks of a contrasting color. The
action of natural selection in producing a small but
highly significant step of evolution was seemingly
demonstrated, with birds as the selecting force.
Not every researcher has been convinced that
natural selection by birds is the only explanation of
the observed frequencies of dark and light
peppered moths. More recent data, however,
provide additional support for Kettleweir's ideas
about natural selection. The light-colored form of
the peppered moth is making a strong comeback.
In Britain, a Clean Air Act was passed in 1965. Sir
Cyril Clarke has been trapping moths at his home
in Liverpool, Merseyside, since 1959. Before about
1975, 90 percent of the moths were dark, but since
then there has been a steep decline in melanic
forms, and in 1989 only 29.6 percent of the moths
caught were melanic. The mean concentration of
sulphur dioxide pollution fell from about 300
micrograms per cubic meter in 1970 to less than 50
micrograms per cubic meter in 1975 and has
remained fairly constant since then. If the spread of
the light-colored form of the moth continues at the
same speed as the melanic form spread in the last
century, soon the melanic form will again be only
an occasional resident of the Liverpool area.

39 – 3 Forest Fire Suppression
Forest fires have recently increased in intensity and
extent in some forest types throughout the western
United States. This recent increase in fires has
resulted partly from climate change the recent trend
toward hot, dry summers and partly from human
activities, for complicated reasons that foresters
came increasingly to understand about 30 years
ago but whose relative importance is still debated.
One factor is the direct effect of logging, which
often turns a forest into something approximating a
huge pile of kindling (wood for burning): the ground
in a logged forest may remain covered with
branches and treetops, left behind when the
valuable trunks are carted away; a dense growth of
new vegetation springs up, further increasing the
forest's fuel loads; and the trees logged and
removed are of course the biggest and most fireresistant individuals, leaving behind smaller and
more flammable trees.
Another factor is that the United States Forest
Service in the first decade of the 1900s adopted
the policy of fire suppression (attempting to put out
forest fires) for the obvious reason that it did not
want valuable timber to go up in smoke, or people's
homes and lives to be threatened. The Forest
Service's announced goal became "Put out every
forest fire by 10:00 A. M. on the morning after the
day when it is first reported." Firefighters became
much more successful at achieving that goal after
1945, thanks to improved firefighting technology.
For a few decades the amount of land burnt
annually decreased by 80 percent. That happy
situation began to change in the 1980s, due to the
increasing frequency of large forest fires that were
essentially impossible to extinguish unless rain and
low winds combined to help. People began to
realize that the United States federal government's
fire-suppression policy was contributing to those
big fires and that natural fires caused by lightning
had previously played an important role in
maintaining forest structure.
The natural role of fire varies with altitude, tree
species, and forest type. To make Montana's lowaltitude ponderosa pine forest as an example,
historical records, plus counts of annual tree rings
and datable fire scars on tree stumps,
demonstrated that a ponderosa pine forest
experiences a lightning-lit fire about once a decade
under natural conditions (i.e.., before fire
suppression began around 1910 and became
effective after 1945). The mature ponderosa trees
have bark two inches thick and are relatively
resistant to fire, which instead burns out the
understory - the lower layer - of fire-sensitive
Douglas fir seedlings that have grown up since the
previous fire. But after only a decade's growth until
the next fire, those young seedling plants are still
too low for fire to spread from them into the crowns
of the ponderosa pine trees. Hence the fire remains
confined to ground and understory. As a result,
many natural ponderosa pine forests have a
parklike appearance, with low fuel loads, big trees
spaced apart, and a relatively clear understory.
However, loggers concentrated on removing those
big, old, valuable, fire-resistant ponderosa pines,
while fire suppression for decades let the
understory fill up with Douglas fir saplings that
would in turn become valuable when full-grown.
Tree densities increased from 30 to 200 trees per
acre, the forest's fuel load increased by a factor of
6, and the government repeatedly failed to
appropriate money to thin out the saplings. When a
fire finally does start in a sapling-choked forest,
whether due to lightning or human carelessness or
(regrettably often) intentional arson, the dense, tall
saplings (young trees) may become a ladder that
allows the fire to jump into the crowns of the trees.
The outcome is sometimes an unstoppable inferno.
Foresters now identify the biggest problem in
managing Western forests as what to do with those
increased fuel loads that built up during the
previous half century of effective fire suppression.
In the wetter eastern United States, dead trees rot
away more quickly than in the drier West, where
more dead trees persist like giant matchsticks. In
an ideal world, the Forest Service would manage
and restore the forests, thin them out, and remove
the dense understory by cutting or by controlled
small fires. But no politician or voter wants to spend
what it would cost to do that.

43 – 2 The Origin of Petroleum
Petroleum is defined as a gaseous, liquid, and
semisolid naturally occurring substance that
consists chiefly of hydrocarbons (chemical
compounds of carbon and hydrogen). Petroleum is
therefore a term that includes both oil and natural
gas. Petroleum is nearly always found in marine
sedimentary rocks. In the ocean, microscopic
phytoplankton (tiny floating plants) and bacteria
(simple, single-celled organisms) are the principal
sources of organic matter that is trapped and
buried in sediment. Most of the organic matter is
buried in clay that is slowly converted to a finegrained sedimentary rock known as shale. During
this conversion, organic compounds are
transformed to oil and natural gas.
Sampling on the continental shelves and along the
base of the continental slopes has shown that fine
muds beneath the seafloor contain up to 8 percent
organic matter. Two additional kinds of evidence
support the hypothesis that petroleum is a product
of the decomposition of organic matter: oil
possesses optical properties known only in
hydrocarbons derived from organic matter, and oil
contains nitrogen and certain compounds believed
to originate only in living matter. A complex
sequence of chemical reactions is involved in
converting the original solid organic matter to oil
and gas, and additional chemical changes may
occur in the oil and gas even after they have
formed.
It is now well established that petroleum migrates
through aquifers and can become trapped in
reservoirs. Petroleum migration is analogous to
groundwater migration. When oil and gas are
squeezed out of the shale in which they originated
and enter a body of sandstone or limestone
somewhere above, they migrate readily because
sandstones (consisting of quartz grains) and
limestones (consisting of carbonate minerals) are
much more permeable than any shale. The force of
molecular attraction between oil and quartz or
carbonate minerals is weaker than that between
water and quartz or carbonate minerals. Hence,
because oil and water do not mix, water remains
fastened to the quartz or carbonate grains, while oil
occupies the central parts of the larger openings in
the porous sandstone or limestone. Because oil is
lighter than water, it tends to glide upward past the
carbonate- and quartz-held water. In this way, oil
becomes segregated from the water; when it
encounters a trap, it can form a pool.
Most of the petroleum that forms in sediments does
not find a suitable trap and eventually makes its
way, along with groundwater, to the surface of the
sea. It is estimated that no more than 0.1 percent
of all the organic matter originally buried in a
sediment is eventually trapped in an oil pool. It is
not surprising, therefore, that the highest ratio of oil
and gas pools to volume of sediment is found in
rock no older than 2.5 million years—young
enough so that little of the petroleum has leaked
away—and that nearly 60 percent of all oil and gas
discovered so far has been found in strata that
formed in the last 65 million years This does not
mean that older rocks produced less petroleum; it
simply means that oil in older rocks has had a
longer time in which to leak away.
How much oil is there in the world? This is an
extremely controversial question. Many billions of
barrels of oil have already been pumped out of the
ground. A lot of additional oil has been located by
drilling but is still waiting to be pumped out.
Possibly a great deal more oil remains to be found
by drilling. Unlike coal, the volume of which can be
accurately estimated, the volume of undiscovered
oil can only be guessed at. Guesses involve the
use of accumulated experience from a century of
drilling. Knowing how much oil has been found in
an intensively drilled area, such as eastern Texas,
experts make estimates of probable volumes in
other regions where rock types and structures are
similar to those in eastern Texas. Using this
approach and considering all the sedimentary
basins of the world, experts estimate that
somewhere between 1,500 and 3,000 billion
barrels of oil will eventually be discovered.

49 – 3 Background for the Industrial Revolution
The Industrial Revolution had several roots, one of
which was a commercial revolution that, beginning
as far back as the sixteenth century, accompanied
Europe's expansion overseas. Both exports and
imports showed spectacular growth, particularly in
England and France. An increasingly larger portion
of the stepped-up commercial activity was the
result of trade with overseas colonies. Imports
included a variety of new beverages, spices, and
ship's goods around the world and brought money
flowing back. Europe's economic institutions,
particularly those in England, were strong, had
wealth available for new investment, and seemed
almost to be waiting for some technological
breakthrough that would expand their profit-making
potential even more.
The breakthrough came in Great Britain, where
several economic advantages created a climate
especially favorable to the encouragement of new
technology. One was its geographic location at the
crossroads of international trade. Internally, Britain
was endowed with easily navigable natural
waterway, which helped its trade and
communication with the world. Beginning in the
1770's, it enjoyed a boom in canal building, which
helped make its domestic market more accessible.
Because water transportation was the cheapest
means of carrying goods to market, canals reduced
prices and thus increased consumer demand.
Great Britain also had rich deposits of coal that fed
the factories springing up in industrial and
consumer goods.
Another advantage was Britain's large population of
rural, agricultural wage earners, as well as cottage
workers, who had the potential of being more
mobile than peasants of some other countries.
Eventually they found their way to the cities or
mining communities and provided the human
power upon which the Industrial Revolution was
built. The British people were also consumers; the
absence of internal tariffs, such as those that
existed in France or Italy or between the German
states, made Britain the largest free-trade area in
Europe. Britain's relatively stable government also
helped create an atmosphere conducive to
industrial progress.
Great Britain's better-developed banking and credit
system also helped speed the industrial progress,
as did the fact that it was the home of an
impressive array of entrepreneurs and inventors.
Among them were a large number of
nonconformists whose religious principles
encouraged thrift and industry rather than luxurious
living and who tended to pour their profits back into
their business, thus providing the basis for
continued expansion.
A precursor to the Industrial Revolution was a
revolution in agricultural techniques. Ideas about
agricultural reform developed first in Holland, where
as early as the mid-seventeenth century, such
modern methods as crop rotation, heavy
fertilization, and diversification were all in use.
Dutch peasant farmers were known throughout
Europe for their agricultural innovations, but as
British markets and opportunities grew, the English
quickly learned from them. As early as the
seventeenth century the Dutch were helping them
drain marshes and fens where, with the help of
advanced techniques, they grew new crops. By the
mid-eighteenth century new agricultural methods
as well as selective breeding of livestock had
caught on throughout the country.
Much of the increased production was consumed
by Great Britain's burgeoning population. At the
same time, people were moving to the city, partly
because of the enclosure movement; that is, the
fencing of common fields and pastures in order to
provide more compact, efficient privately held
agricultural parcels that would produce more goods
and greater profits. In the sixteenth century
enclosures were usually used for creating sheep
pastures, but by the eighteenth century new
farming techniques made it advantageous for large
landowners to seek enclosures in order to improve
agricultural production. Between 1714 and 1820
over 6 million acres of English land were enclosed.
As a result, many small, independent farmers were
forced to sell out simply because they could not
compete. Non-landholding peasants and cottage
workers, who worked for wages and grazed cows
or pigs on the village common, were also hurt when
the common was no longer available. It was such
people who began to flock to the cities seeking
employment and who found work in the factories
that would transform the nation and, the world.
17
59 – 1 Building Materials
It is difficult to exaggerate the radical change that
the new industrial world of the nineteenth century
brought to architectural materials Since the
beginning of architectural history, the same basic
substances had been employed. They were
provided directly by nature and used in their natural
or near-natural state, only cut, shaped, and dried
into the functional forms of timbers, stone blocks,
and clay bricks. The exceptions were lime mortar
and Roman concrete. Metals, which had the tensile
strength that masonry materials lacked, were
employed in minor and supplementary ways.
Bronze was expensive as well as brittle Iron, the
structurally more important metal, was available in
limited quantities and uneven quality, and was too
easily converted to rust by the elements. It was,
therefore, restricted in use to things such as tierods and chains, and, along with bronze, to
masonry clamps and decoration. Prior to the
nineteenth century, the structural presence of iron
in architecture was scarcely noticeable.
The Industrial Revolution changed all that Iron
materials became available in such large quantities
that they could play far more than a minor
architectural role In 1800, the world production of
iron stood at 825,000 tons, by 1830 it was
1,825.000 tons, and nearly 40,000,000 in 1900-an
increase of almost 50-fold over the century. The
growth was not only in quantity, but quality as well.
Iron, found bountifully in Earth’s crust as an oxide,
is a material of almost protean variability It is not
simply pure or impure, but can be made hard or
soft, brittle or ductile, strong or weak. These
qualities depend on carbon content, freedom from
impurities (slag), and heating and cooling
treatments of the refined metal. Traditionally, three
versions existed: cast iron, wrought iron, and steel.
Cast iron is the crudest form, containing the most
impurities and thus being extremely brittle. Wrought
iron, because it includes almost no carbon, is
highly malleable (hence its name), but also
comparatively soft. The optimum material is steel,
which incorporates a restricted amount of carbon
for hardness but is otherwise free of impurities,
giving it great strength, and which, as a result of
tempering treatments, is also malleable.
Cast and wrought iron came into prodigious
manufacture in the early and mid-nineteenth
century as a result of rapid growth in demand, new
means to transport materials, and more efficient
iron-founding techniques. But the mass production
of steel required further technological innovations
to rid the metal of weakening impurities and to
control more perfectly the amount of carbon added
Such advances were made with the Bessemer
process (put into use in 1860) and the open-hearth
process of 1864, scientific iron metallurgy in the
last third of the century perfected these techniques.
A significant but little-known fact is that the mam
form of increased steel production was technically
not steel but a kind of wrought iron. It lacked a
crucial property of true steel-its hardening poweryet it differed from the older forms of wrought iron
because it was free from the weakening presence
of slag, at the same time being malleable (unlike
cast iron). It was called steel only because the
name carried the status of a high-quality and highpriced product.
Another alternative new building substance was
concrete, composed of an aggregate of broken
stone, gravel, or other small chunks of hard matter
embedded in a matrix of lime, sand, and water First
used in Roman times, its modern revival depended
on the invention of portland cement in 1824, a
substance of many times greater strength,
durability, and fire resistance than ancient lime
cement Mass-produced concrete began to come
into widespread use in the 1850s and 1860s, in the
construction of the sewers of Paris, for example,
However, even with portland cement, the use of
concrete was still severely restricted by its low
tensile strength, but the remedy was at hand in the
newly available iron and steel; their properties
complemented those of concrete. The latter
material was cheap, easily molded into large
structural forms with great compressive but little
tensile strength. Iron and steel, on the other hand
were expensive, difficult to shape, yet endowed
with extreme tensile strength and easily procurable
in the simple form of long, thin bars.

AGRICULTURE
21 – 2 The Origins of Agriculture
How did it come about that farming developed
independently in a number of world centers (the
Southeast Asian mainland, Southwest Asia,
Central America, lowland and highland South
America, and equatorial Africa) at more or less the
same time? Agriculture developed slowly among
populations that had an extensive knowledge of
plants and animals. Changing from hunting and
gathering to agriculture had no immediate
advantages. To start with, it forced the population
to abandon the nomad's life and become
sedentary, to develop methods of storage and,
often, systems of irrigation. While hunter-gatherers
always had the option of moving elsewhere when
the resources were exhausted, this became more
difficult with farming. Furthermore, as the
archaeological record shows, the state of health of
agriculturalists was worse than that of their
contemporary hunter-gatherers.
Traditionally, it was believed that the transition to
agriculture was the result of a worldwide population
crisis. It was argued that once hunter-gatherers
had occupied the whole world, the population
started to grow everywhere and food became
scarce; agriculture would have been a solution to
this problem. We know, however, that
contemporary hunter-gatherer societies control
their population in a variety of ways. The idea of a
world population crisis is therefore unlikely,
although population pressure might have arisen in
some areas.
Climatic changes at the end of the glacial period
13,000 years ago have been proposed to account
for the emergence of farming. The temperature
increased dramatically in a short period of time
(years rather than centuries), allowing for a growth
of the hunting-gathering population due to the
abundance of resources. There were, however,
fluctuations in the climatic conditions, with the
consequences that wet conditions were followed by
dry ones, so that the availability of plants and
animals oscillated brusquely.
It would appear that the instability of the climatic
conditions led populations that had originally been
nomadic to settle down and develop a sedentary
style of life, which led in turn to population growth
and to the need to increase the amount of food
available. Farming originated in these conditions.
Later on, it became very difficult to change
because of the significant expansion of these
populations. It could be argued, however, that
these conditions are not sufficient to explain the
origins of agriculture. Earth had experienced
previous periods of climatic change, and yet
agriculture had not been developed.
It is archaeologist Steven Mithen’s thesis, brilliantly
developed in his book The Prehistory of the Mind
(1996), that approximately 40,000 years ago the
human mind developed cognitive fluidity, that is,
the integration of the specializations of the mind:
technical, natural history (geared to understanding
the behavior and distribution of natural resources),
social intelligence, and the linguistic capacity.
Cognitive fluidity explains the appearance of art,
religion, and sophisticated speech. Once humans
possessed such a mind, they were able to find an
imaginative solution to a situation of severe
economic crisis such as the farming dilemma
described earlier. Mithen proposes the existence of
four mental elements to account for the emergence
of farming: (1) the ability to develop tools that could
be used intensively to harvest and process plant
resources; (2) the tendency to use plants and
animals as the medium to acquire social prestige
and power; (3) the tendency to develop “social
relationships” with animals structurally similar to
those developed with people — specifically, the
ability to think of animals as people
(anthropomorphism) and of people as animals
(totemism); and (4) the tendency to manipulate
plants and animals.
The fact that some societies domesticated animals
and plants, discovered the use of metal tools,
became literate, and developed a state should not
make us forget that others developed pastoralism
or horticulture (vegetable gardening) but remained
illiterate and at low levels of productivity; a few
entered the modern period as hunting and
gathering societies. It is anthropologically important
to inquire into the conditions that made some
societies adopt agriculture while others remained
hunter-gatherers or horticulturalists. However, it
should be kept in mind that many societies that
knew of agriculture more or less consciously
avoided it. Whether Mithen’s explanation is
satisfactory is open to contention, and some
authors have recently emphasized the importance
of other factors.
19
23 – 2 Seventeenth-Century Dutch Agriculture
Agriculture and fishing formed the primary sector of
the economy in the Netherlands in the seventeenth
century. Dutch agriculture was modernized and
commercialized. New crops and agricultural
techniques raised levels of production so that they
were in line with market demands, and cheap grain
was imported annually from the Baltic region in
large quantities. According to estimates, about
120,000 tons of imported grain fed about 600,000
people: that is about a third of the Dutch
population. Importing the grain, which would have
been expensive and time consuming for the Dutch
to have produced themselves, kept the price of
grain low and thus stimulated individual demand for
other foodstuffs and consumer goods.
Apart from this, being able to give up laborintensive grain production freed both the land and
the workforce for more productive agricultural
divisions. The peasants specialized in livestock
husbandry and dairy farming as well as in
cultivating industrial crops and fodder crops: flax,
madder, and rape were grown, as were tobacco,
hops, and turnips. These products were bought
mostly by urban businesses. There was also a
demand among urban consumers for dairy
products such as butter and cheese, which, in the
sixteenth century, had become more expensive
than grain. The high prices encouraged the
peasants to improve their animal husbandry
techniques; for example, they began feeding their
animals indoors in order to raise the milk yield of
their cows.
In addition to dairy farming and cultivating industrial
crops, a third sector of the Dutch economy
reflected the way in which agriculture was being
modernized-horticulture. In the sixteenth century,
fruit and vegetables were to be found only in
gardens belonging to wealthy people. This
changed in the early part of the seventeenth
century when horticulture became accepted as an
agricultural sector. Whole villages began to
cultivate fruit and vegetables. The produce was
then transported by water to markets in the cities,
where the consumption of fruit and vegetables was
no longer restricted to the wealthy.
As the demand for agricultural produce from both
consumers and industry increased, agricultural land
became more valuable and people tried to work the
available land more intensively and to reclaim more
land from wetlands and lakes. In order to increase
production on existing land, the peasants made
more use of crop rotation and, in particular, began
to apply animal waste to the soil regularly, rather
than leaving the fertilization process up to the
grazing livestock. For the first time industrial waste,
such as ash from the soap-boilers, was collected in
the cities and sold in the country as artificial
fertilizer. The increased yield and price of land
justified reclaiming and draining even more land.
The Dutch battle against the sea is legendary.
Noorderkwartier in Holland, with its numerous lakes
and stretches of water, was particularly suitable for
land reclamation and one of the biggest projects
undertaken there was the draining of the Beemster
lake which began in 1608. The richest merchants in
Amsterdam contributed money to reclaim a good
7,100 hectares of land. Forty-three windmills
powered the drainage pumps so that they were
able to lease the reclamation to farmers as early as
1612, with the investors receiving annual leasing
payments at an interest rate of 17 percent. Land
reclamation continued, and between 1590 and
1665, almost 100,000 hectares were reclaimed
from the wetland areas of Holland, Zeeland, and
Friesland. However, land reclamation decreased
significantly after the middle of the seventeenth
century because the price of agricultural products
began to fall, making land reclamation far less
profitable in the second part of the century.
Dutch agriculture was finally affected by the
general agricultural crisis in Europe during the last
two decades of the seventeenth century. However,
what is astonishing about this is not that Dutch
agriculture was affected by critical phenomena
such as a decrease in sales and production, but
the fact that the crisis appeared only relatively late
in Dutch agriculture. In Europe as a whole, the
exceptional reduction in the population and the
related fall in demand for grain since the beginning
of the seventeenth century had caused the price of
agricultural products to fall. Dutch peasants were
able to remain unaffected by this crisis for a long
time because they had specialized in dairy farming
industrial crops, and horticulture. However, toward
the end of the seventeenth century, they too were
overtaken by the general agricultural crisis.
20
33 – 2 Railroads and Commercial Agriculture in
Nineteenth-Century United States
By 1850 the United States possessed roughly
9,000 miles of railroad track; ten years later it had
over 30,000 miles, more than the rest of the world
combined. Much of the new construction during the
1850s occurred in the west of the Appalachian
Mountains – over 2,000 miles in the states of Ohio
and Illinois alone.
The effect of the new railroad lines rippled outward
through the economy. Farmers along the tracks
began to specialize in crops that they could market
in distant locations. With their profits they
purchased manufactured goods that earlier they
might have made at home. Before the railroad
reached Tennessee, the state produced about
25,000 bushels (or 640 tons) of wheat, which sold
for less than 50 cents a bushel. Once the railroad
came, farmers in the same counties grew 400,000
bushels (over 10,000 tons) and sold their crop at a
dollar a bushel.
The new railroad networks shifted the direction of
western trade. In 1840 most northwestern grain
was shipped south down the Mississippi River to
the bustling port of New Orleans. But low water
made steamboat travel hazardous in summer, and
ice shut down traffic in winter. Products such as
lard, tallow, and cheese quickly spoiled if stored in
New Orleans’ hot and humid warehouses.
Increasingly, traffic from the Midwest flowed west to
east, over the new rail lines. Chicago became the
region’s hub, linking the farms of the upper Midwest
to New York and other eastern cities by more than
2,000 miles of track in 1855. Thus while the value
of goods shipped by river to New Orleans
continued to increase, the South’s overall share of
western trade dropped dramatically.
A sharp rise in demand for grain abroad also
encouraged farmers in the Northeast and Midwest
to become more commercially oriented. Wheat,
which in 1845 commanded $1.08 a bushel in New
York City, fetched $2.46 in 1855; in similar fashion
the price of corn nearly doubled. Farmers
responded by specializing in cash crops, borrowing
to purchase more land, and investing in equipment
to increase productivity.
As railroad lines fanned out from Chicago, farmers
began to acquire open prairie land in Illinois and
then Iowa, putting the fertile, deep black soil into
production. Commercial agriculture transformed
this remarkable treeless environment. To settlers
accustomed to eastern woodlands, the thousands
of square miles of tall grass were an awesome
sight. Indian grass, Canada wild rye, and native big
bluestem all grew higher than a person. Because
eastern plows could not penetrate the densely
tangled roots of prairie grass, the earliest settlers
erected farms along the boundary separating the
forest from the prairie. In 1837, however, John
Deere patented a sharp-cutting steel plow that
sliced through the sod without soil sticking to the
blade. Cyrus McCormick refined a mechanical
reaper that harvested fourteen times more wheat
with the same amount of labor. By the 1850s
McCormick was selling 1,000 reapers a year and
could not keep up with demand, while Deere turned
out 10,000 plows annually.
The new commercial farming fundamentally altered
the Midwestern landscape and the environment.
Native Americans had grown corn in the region for
years, but never in such large fields as did later
settlers who became farmers, whose surpluses
were shipped east. Prairie farmers also introduced
new crops that were not part of the earlier
ecological system, notably wheat, along with fruits
and vegetables. Native grasses were replaced by a
small number of plants cultivated as commodities.
Corn had the best yields, but it was primarily used
to feed livestock. Because bread played a key role
in the American and European diet, wheat became
the major cash crop. Tame grasses replaced native
grasses in pastures for making hay.
Western farmers altered the landscape by reducing
the annual fires that had kept the prairie free from
trees. In the absence of these fires, trees
reappeared on land not in cultivation and, if
undisturbed, eventually formed woodlots. The
earlier unbroken landscape gave way to
independent farms, each fenced off in a precise
checkerboard pattern. It was an artificial ecosystem
of animals, woodlots, and crops, whose large,
uniform layout made western farms more efficient
than the more-irregular farms in the East.

74 – 2 The Commercialization of Pearl River
Agriculture
The Pearl River Delta of southern China was an
agriculturally rich region. Formed of alluvial soils
that had been captured from the silt flowing down
from the major rivers,these sand flats,as the
Chinese called them,were worked and reworked
until they became very productive rice paddies that
by the sixteenth century annually produced two
crops of rice and one of vegetables and
wheat.Peasant farmers produced on their own
plots much of the food the family
consumed.However,agriculture in the region could
not be called subsistence agriculture,for many
nonfood commercial crops were grown and
exchanged in markets that dotted the
countryside.Besides rice,peasant farmers in the
Pearl River Delta grew sugarcane,hemp,cotton,and
mulberries to feed silkworms, among other crops.
But while commerce and market exchanges were
an important part of the rural economy until about
1550,the rural economy was not
commercialized.As the population grew from 1400
to 1550,the gross volume of crops marketed and
the number of rural markets both increased,but
they did so at the rate of population growth.The
proportion of agricultural land devoted to
commercial crops in 1550 was about what it had
been in 1400.But after 1550 the agricultural
economy of the region became highly
commercialized.Markets and marketing activity
expanded at a rate faster than that of the
population.
The most immediate stimulus for the
commercialization of the economy was the new
demand for Chinese goods-in particular silk and
porcelains-from European traders who arrived in
the South China Sea in the sixteenth century.For
the Pearl River region,the critical trade flow was
triangular,linked by the Portuguese.Either with their
own funds or with silver that Japanese merchants
supplied,Portuguese traders headed up the Pearl
River to biannual fairs in the city of Guangzhou
where they exchanged silver for export
goods.These goods were loaded onto ships bound
for the Japanese city of Nagasaki.Japanese
merchants in Nagasaki paid in silver for the
Chinese goods,launching another round of
trade.Trade through Manila,in the Philippines,also
brought silver into the South China economy.
Chinese merchants from Guangdong and Fujian
provinces sailed to Manila with their goods,which
the Spanish bought with silver.From there the silver
flowed back to China as the Chinese commodities
found their way to Europe.By 1600 this trade
resulted in an annual inflow of perhaps 200,000
kilograms of silver into the coastal economies of
south and southeast China.
In the Pearl River Delta,the silk industry developed
on a base that was first created by the sand-flat
fields and then a particular combination of fish
ponds with fruit trees. In the fifteenth century
peasant farmers in the Pearl River Delta began
replacing some of their sand-flat rice fields with
fishponds,probably in response to increased
demand from Guangzhou. On the
embankments,peasant farmers in the early Ming
Dynasty (1368-1644)mostly planted fruit
trees,giving rise to the fruit tree and fishpond
combination.The carp fed on organic matter that
either dropped or was thrown into the pond,while
the mud scooped up from the pond fertilized the
fruit trees and the rice fields and added height to
the embankments and more protection for the
fishponds.
The fruit tree and fishpond culture provided a
ready-made base for expansion of the silk
industry.As the demand for silk increased,peasant
farmers replaced the fruit trees with mulberry trees
(silkworms feed on mulberry leaves)and then
began digging up even more rice paddies to
expand this system.By 1581 in the Longshan area
of Shunde county,for example,eighteen percent of
the productive land was fishponds and,combined
with the mulberry trees on the embankments,
accounted for about thirty percent of the cultivated
land area.

65 – 3 Pastoralism and Agriculture in Iran
Geographical constraints have had important
consequences for the economy and society of Iran.
Where rainfall is adequate, there are fertile valleys
and grasslands suitable for grazing animals.
However, since the natural vegetation tends to be
sparse, it is difficult for such animals to remain in
one place for any length of time. Thus nomadic
pastoralism-keeping livestock (such as sheep and
goats) by wandering from place to place-was one
of the first and most persistent human economic
activities to flourish in this area. This nomadic
movement was often of the vertical variety, with
people and animals moving from lowlands in
wintertime to highlands in summer. The animals
raised by the pastoralists provided not only food
but also material for crafts such as the making of
carpets, thick felt cloth, and tents. The pastoralists
were typically organized into large tribal
confederations capable of controlling the vast
territories needed for maintaining their herds.
The tribes were a powerful social and political
factor throughout Iranian history. The skills
necessary for herding animals, hunting and
chasing off predators, directing migrations,
disciplining tribesmen, and protecting lands and
animals from rivals could be easily adapted and
directed toward military purposes as well. It was
typically the tribes that produced the soldiers and
rulers of the country and provided the power base
for most of its dynasties. Once established,
governments needed to cultivate the support of
friendly tribal groups and tried to control hostile
tribes by combat, deportation, or forcible
settlement. At the beginning of the twentieth
century, approximately one- fourth of the
population were tribal peoples, and they were a
potent force in Iranian affairs. With the advent of
mechanized armies in the 1930s, however, there
were systematic efforts to break the power of the
tribes and to coerce the tribal population into a
sedentary way of life. These efforts have been
largely successful, and the tribes are no longer so
significant a force in either the Iranian economy or
society. Less than 5 percent of the population now
consists of nomadic pastoralists.
The aridity of the Iranian plateau retarded its
agricultural development in comparison to adjacent
regions such as Mesopotamia, which had great
rivers to draw upon for a supply of water.
Eventually, at some uncertain date probably about
26 centuries ago, there was a technological
breakthrough that made it possible to farm crops
outside the few oases, streams, and other places
with sufficient rainfall for agriculture. This was the
development of underground canals known as
qanats. The qanat system took advantage of the
natural slope (inclination) of the plateau basins. A
well would be dug in the foothills to reach a water
source, usually water from melting snow that had
seeped underground. Then a sequence of wells
and shafts connected by underground canals
would be constructed to transport the water to an
area suitable for cultivation where it could support
the needs of one or more villages. The slope of the
underground canals had to be controlled carefully
to prevent erosion, and the interior surface of wells
and shafts needed to be kept under constant
maintenance to prevent them from collapsing.
Since the canals were underground, loss from
evaporation was minimized.Gravity provided the
means of moving the water, so no mechanical
energy was required to operate the system.The
numerous wells and shafts kept the length of the
tricky underground canal short and facilitated
repairs of each segment.Built up over the
centuries, the system eventually became immense.
It has been estimated that the total length of the
qanat system today, counting wells, shafts, and
canals, is in excess of 300,000 kilometers (almost
the distance from Earth to the Moon!), which gives
some idea of the tremendous investment in money
and labor power it represents. Yet the type of
agriculture that developed around the qanat system
gave modest yields and required hard work from
the peasant farmers, who received only a small
share of the agricultural produce.

67 – 1 Crop Engineering
Our current ability to precisely engineer crop
genomes was preceded by a long history of genetic
manipulation in agriculture. Human impact and its
accompanying effects began early in our history at
many tropical and subtropical sites around the
globe. Our ancestors were omnivores, consuming
whatever plant or animal material they fortuitously
encountered. Even then, humans had considerable
effects on the environment, reducing and even
driving to extinction populations of the animal
species they hunted and expanding the distribution
of plants by accidentally distributing seeds as they
migrated.
Humans probably first realized that seeds could
yield a stable food supply through agriculture when
they observed plants arising from refuse or
wasteland, perhaps fruit trees growing along forest
and jungle paths from discarded or defecated
seeds or else vegetables sprouting in garbage
dumps at temporary settlements. A more organized
approach to agriculture began about eight to ten
thousand years ago coincidentally at a number of
locations around the globe. The most diverse
farming developed in the Near East, with legumes,
cereals flax, sesame, and fruit trees. At about the
same time, New World residents were growing
beans, maize, squashes, and potatoes, and Asian
farmers were beginning to cultivate rice.
These early domesticated crops foreshadowed the
overwhelming changes contemporary agriculture
has wrought in plants. Humans soon learned to
separate varieties that could be grown as crops
from wild types in order to prevent characteristics
undesirable for cultivation from mingling with those
selected for farming. Continued selection of crops
with desirable characteristics increased the
separation between feral (wild) and managed
plants and accelerated the diminishing diversity
and more limited variation found in today's crops.
The simplest way to select crops is to save seeds
preferentially from plants with beneficial traits, and
the first farmers selected for large seeds and fruit,
increased seed production, lack of dormancy,
faster germination, higher annual yield, and
reduced seed scattering. The success of this early
selection resulted in an accelerating impact of
agriculture on crop diversity and feral plants. Crops
quickly became commodities, moved and traded
over a rapidly widening area, so that many plants
were distributed well beyond their previous ranges,
and some throughout the globe.
Three phenomena have characterized the more
recent impact of agriculture on Earth. The first was
the increase in human population, which has
doubled at shorter and shorter intervals over the
last thousand years. The result was increased
acreage under cultivation and a fundamental
remodeling of the globe toward managed rather
than wild ecosystems. By 1998 there were
3,410,523,800 acres of land under cultivation
worldwide, an area larger than the United States.
Entire ecosystems have disappeared, others
remain but are threatened, and the sheer volume of
people and area of farmland have been major
forces of biological change.
The second event through which agriculture
modified our planet was European colonization.
Previously, migration and trade had moved crops
between countries and continents, but the
Europeans inaugurated an unprecedented
dispersal of biological material worldwide. Maize,
tomatoes, and potatoes were transported from the
New World to the Old; wheat, rye, and barley were
carried from the Old World to the New; and rice,
soybeans, and alfalfa were moved from their Asian
sources to every arable continent. Each of these
and innumerable other introductions conveyed not
only unique material but also assemblages of
introduced plant pests and diseases that today
cause the majority of pest-management problems
around the world.
The third factor shaping the nature of agriculture
and the environment alike is the increasing
precision with which we have selected and bred
crops. This acuity stemmed from many advances,
but at its heart lies the work of two men-one, the
English naturalist Charles Darwin, and the other,
an Austrian monk, Gregor Mendel. The concepts of
evolution and genetics were not their work alone,
but both of them were decades ahead of their
colleagues in synthesizing the companion concepts
of natural selection and inheritance that are at the
core of all contemporary biological science and that
form the substrate upon which biotechnology grew.

71 – 3 The Productivity of Wet Rice Farming
The wet rice fields of Asia are the most productive
of all preindustrial intensive agricultural systems.
As the term "wet rice" suggests, the method
involves flooding the fields for most of the growing
season.In some areas the water comes entirely
from the natural rainfall of the monsoons, but the
water level often is controlled by artificial irrigation.
Most wet rice is, therefore,grown on the floodplains
of rivers. In parts of Southeast Asia,southern
China,and the Himalayan fringes, wet rice is grown
on terraced hillsides originally constructed
centuries ago.
Perhaps the most remarkable feature of wet rice
cultivation is the capability of a plot to yield a
harvest year in and year out, with little or no need
to be left uncultivated for extended periods in order
to recover its fertility.Indeed,where the seasonal
availability of water is adequate, the same plot may
yield two and even three harvests in a single year,
being under almost continuous cultivation. This
capability has been attributed to four factors.the
protection from erosion the water gives the soil, the
high water table of the rivers’ floodplains that
reduces the leaching of nutrients from the soil,the
replacement of soil nutrients by the silt carried in
the rivers' flooding, and nitrogen fixation (the
conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into forms
usable by plants) from the blue-green algae that
live in the floodwater,The chief benefit of wet riceits ability to grow in the same field year after year-is
then related to the practice of flooding the fields
and allowing the water to remain throughout most
of the maturation period
Despite the advantages of their methods, wet rice
farmers must solve problems relating to the
management of water, because the proper supply
of water at the proper time is so important for a
good yield. It is more efficient if storage ponds or
tanks, canals, ditches, and other improvements are
held and managed communally, because less labor
is required to construct and maintain them than if
each family owned its own Water may be stored in
small lakes or ponds or captured and held in tanks
until it is used to flood the fields The water level
must be controlled fairly precisely while the rice is
growing If it rises too high, the plants will be unable
to photosynthesize and if it falls too low, the
benefits of having standing water in the fields will
be reduced Unless the land is naturally flat, the
plots, therefore, must be leveled to keep the height
of the water constant in different areas of the field
The water level must be controlled by low dikes,
usually constructed of earth, which can be easily
breached to dram the plot for the harvest.
Managing the supply of the water that is so critical
in growing wet rice requires sophisticated
organization, especially with respect to cooperative
labor patterns and rights of access to both land and
water. Each family may work its lands on its own,
but who will construct and maintain public irrigation
works? Who will decide when dikes, dams, ditches,
and tanks need to be repaired, and how will the
labor to repair them be coordinated? The water
used on the fields of one family is not available to
other families How shall the consumption of water
be coordinated? Who will get how much water and
when9 How. in short, will use rights to water be
determined?
In one example of organizing the allocation of
water to the fields,the Sinhalese of the dry zone of
Sri Lanka draw water from a collectively owned
rain-fed reservoir constructed of earth. All of the
cultivated land of a village is in a single area, below
the reservoir. The entire field is laid out into diked
plots of equal size. Each plot receives a fixed
amount of water from the communal reservoir,
though the number of families working a single plot
varies Poor families must share water rights of
access to one plot with other families, whereas
richer families have access to several plots.
Assigning each plot (rather than each family) the
same proportion of irrigation water reduces the
chance that a given plot will receive insufficient
moisture.

MOUNTAINS / CLIMATE
Geology / Ecology / Ecosystem /
Oceanography
01 – 1 Groundwater
Groundwater is the word used to describe water
that saturates the ground, filling all the available
spaces. By far the most abundant type of
groundwater is meteoric water; this is the
groundwater that circulates as part of the water
cycle. Ordinary meteoric water is water that has
soaked into the ground from the surface, from
precipitation (rain and snow) and from lakes and
streams. There it remains, sometimes for long
periods, before emerging at the surface again. At
first thought it seems incredible that there can be
enough space in the “solid” ground underfoot to
hold all this water.
The necessary space is there, however, in many
forms. The commonest spaces are those among
the particles—sand grains and tiny pebbles—of
loose, unconsolidated sand and gravel. Beds of
this material, out of sight beneath the soil, are
common. They are found wherever fast rivers
carrying loads of coarse sediment once flowed. For
example, as the great ice sheets that covered
North America during the last ice age steadily
melted away, huge volumes of water flowed from
them. The water was always laden with pebbles,
gravel, and sand, known as glacial outwash, that
was deposited as the flow slowed down.
The same thing happens to this day, though on a
smaller scale, wherever a sediment-laden river or
stream emerges from a mountain valley onto
relatively flat land, dropping its load as the current
slows: the water usually spreads out fanwise,
depositing the sediment in the form of a smooth,
fan-shaped slope. Sediments are also dropped
where a river slows on entering a lake or the sea,
the deposited sediments are on a lake floor or the
seafloor at first, but will be located inland at some
future date, when the sea level falls or the land
rises, and such beds are sometimes thousands of
meters thick.
In lowland country almost any spot on the ground
may overlie what was once the bed of a river that
has since become buried by soil; if they are now
below the water’s upper surface (the water table),
the gravels and sands of the former riverbed, and
its sandbars, will be saturated with groundwater.
So much for unconsolidated sediments.
Consolidated (or cemented) sediments, too,
contain millions of minute water-holding pores. This
is because the gaps among the original grains are
often not totally plugged with cementing chemicals;
also, parts of the original grains may become
dissolved by percolating groundwater, either while
consolidation is taking place or at any time
afterwards. The result is that sandstone, for
example, can be as porous as the loose sand from
which it was formed.
Thus a proportion of the total volume of any
sediment, loose or cemented, consists of empty
space. Most crystalline rocks are much more solid;
a common exception is basalt, a form of solidified
volcanic lava, which is sometimes full of tiny
bubbles that make it very porous.
The proportion of empty space in a rock is known
as its porosity. But note that porosity is not the
same as permeability, which measures the ease
with which water can flow through a material; this
depends on the sizes of the individual cavities and
the crevices linking them.
Much of the water in a sample of water-saturated
sediment or rock will drain from it if the sample is
put in a suitable dry place. But some will remain,
clinging to all solid surfaces. It is held there by the
force of surface tension without which water would
drain instantly from any wet surface, leaving it
totally dry. The total volume of water in the
saturated sample must therefore be thought of as
consisting of water that can, and water that cannot,
drain away.
The relative amount of these two kinds of water
varies greatly from one kind of rock or sediment to
another, even though their porosities may be the
same. What happens depends on pore size. If the
pores are large, the water in them will exist as
drops too heavy for surface tension to hold, and it
will drain away; but if the pores are small enough,
the water in them will exist as thin films, too light to
overcome the force of surface tension holding them
in place; then the water will be firmly held.

03 – 2 Depletion of the Ogallala Aquifer
The vast grasslands of the High Plains in the
central United States were settled by farmers and
ranchers in the 1880s. This region has a semiarid
climate, and for 50 years after its settlement, it
supported a low-intensity agricultural economy of
cattle ranching and wheat farming. In the early
twentieth century, however, it was discovered that
much of the High Plains was underlain by a huge
aquifer (a rock layer containing large quantities of
groundwater). This aquifer was named the Ogallala
Aquifer after the Ogallala Sioux Indians, who once
inhabited the region.
The Ogallala Aquifer is a sandstone formation that
underlies some 583,000 square kilometers of land
extending from northwestern Texas to southern
South Dakota. Water from rains and melting snows
has been accumulating in the Ogallala for the past
30,000 years. Estimates indicate that the aquifer
contains enough water to fill Lake Huron, but
unfortunately, under the semiarid climatic
conditions that presently exist in the region, rates of
addition to the aquifer are minimal, amounting to
about half a centimeter a year.
The first wells were drilled into the Ogallala during
the drought years of the early 1930s. The ensuing
rapid expansion of irrigation agriculture, especially
from the 1950s onward, transformed the economy
of the region. More than 100,000 wells now tap the
Ogallala. Modern irrigation devices, each capable
of spraying 4.5 million liters of water a day, have
produced a landscape dominated by geometric
patterns of circular green islands of crops. Ogallala
water has enabled the High Plains region to supply
significant amounts of the cotton, sorghum, wheat,
and corn grown in the United States. In addition, 40
percent of American grain-fed beef cattle are
fattened here.
This unprecedented development of a finite
groundwater resource with an almost negligible
natural recharge rate—that is, virtually no natural
water source to replenish the water supply—has
caused water tables in the region to fall drastically.
In the 1930s, wells encountered plentiful water at a
depth of about 15 meters; currently, they must be
dug to depths of 45 to 60 meters or more. In
places, the water table is declining at a rate of a
meter a year, necessitating the periodic deepening
of wells and the use of ever-more-powerful pumps.
It is estimated that at current withdrawal rates,
much of the aquifer will run dry within 40 years. The
situation is most critical in Texas, where the climate
is driest, the greatest amount of water is being
pumped, and the aquifer contains the least water. It
is projected that the remaining Ogallala water will,
by the year 2030, support only 35 to 40 percent of
the irrigated acreage in Texas that is supported in
1980.
The reaction of farmers to the inevitable depletion
of the Ogallala varies. Many have been attempting
to conserve water by irrigating less frequently or by
switching to crops that require less water. Others,
however, have adopted the philosophy that it is
best to use the water while it is still economically
profitable to do so and to concentrate on high-value
crops such as cotton. The incentive of the farmers
who wish to conserve water is reduced by their
knowledge that many of their neighbors are
profiting by using great amounts of water, and in
the process are drawing down the entire region's
water supplies.
In the face of the upcoming water supply crisis, a
number of grandiose schemes have been
developed to transport vast quantities of water by
canal or pipeline from the Mississippi, the Missouri,
or the Arkansas rivers. Unfortunately, the cost of
water obtained through any of these schemes
would increase pumping costs at least tenfold,
making the cost of irrigated agricultural products
from the region uncompetitive on the national and
international markets. Somewhat more promising
have been recent experiments for releasing
capillary water (water in the soil) above the water
table by injecting compressed air into the ground.
Even if this process proves successful, however, it
would almost triple water costs. Genetic
engineering also may provide a partial solution, as
new strains of drought-resistant crops continue to
be developed. Whatever the final answer to the
water crisis may be, it is evident that within the
High Plains, irrigation water will never again be the
abundant, inexpensive resource it was during the
agricultural boom years of the mid-twentieth
century.
27
02 – 1 Desert Formation
The deserts, which already occupy approximately a
fourth of the Earth's land surface, have in recent
decades been increasing at an alarming pace. The
expansion of desert-like conditions into areas where
they did not previously exist is called desertification. It
has been estimated that an additional one-fourth of
the Earth's land surface is threatened by this process.
Desertification is accomplished primarily through the
loss of stabilizing natural vegetation and the
subsequent accelerated erosion of the soil by wind
and water. In some cases the loose soil is blown
completely away, leaving a stony surface. In other
cases, the finer particles may be removed, while the
sand-sized particles are accumulated to form mobile
hills or ridges of sand.
Even in the areas that retain a soil cover, the
reduction of vegetation typically results in the loss of
the soil's ability to absorb substantial quantities of
water. The impact of raindrops on the loose soil tends
to transfer fine clay particles into the tiniest soil
spaces, sealing them and producing a surface that
allows very little water penetration. Water absorption
is greatly reduced; consequently runoff is increased,
resulting in accelerated erosion rates. The gradual
drying of the soil caused by its diminished ability to
absorb water results in the further loss of vegetation,
so that a cycle of progressive surface deterioration is
established.
In some regions, the increase in desert areas is
occurring largely as the result of a trend toward drier
climatic conditions. Continued gradual global warming
has produced an increase in aridity for some areas
over the past few thousand years. The process may
be accelerated in subsequent decades if global
warming resulting from air pollution seriously
increases.
There is little doubt, however, that desertification in
most areas results primarily from human activities
rather than natural processes. The semiarid lands
bordering the deserts exist in a delicate ecological
balance and are limited in their potential to adjust to
increased environmental pressures. Expanding
populations are subjecting the land to increasing
pressures to provide them with food and fuel. In wet
periods, the land may be able to respond to these
stresses. During the dry periods that are common
phenomena along the desert margins, though, the
pressure on the land is often far in excess of its
diminished capacity, and desertification results.
Four specific activities have been identified as major
contributors to the desertification processes:
overcultivation, overgrazing, firewood gathering, and
overirrigation. The cultivation of crops has expanded
into progressively drier regions as population
densities have grown. These regions are especially
likely to have periods of severe dryness, so that crop
failures are common. Since the raising of most crops
necessitates the prior removal of the natural
vegetation, crop failures leave extensive tracts of land
devoid of a plant cover and susceptible to wind and
water erosion.
The raising of livestock is a major economic activity in
semiarid lands, where grasses are generally the
dominant type of natural vegetation. The
consequences of an excessive number of livestock
grazing in an area are the reduction of the vegetation
cover and the trampling and pulverization of the soil.
This is usually followed by the drying of the soil and
accelerated erosion.
Firewood is the chief fuel used for cooking and
heating in many countries. The increased pressures
of expanding populations have led to the removal of
woody plants so that many cities and towns are
surrounded by large areas completely lacking in trees
and shrubs. The increasing use of dried animal waste
as a substitute fuel has also hurt the soil because this
valuable soil conditioner and source of plant nutrients
is no longer being returned to the land.
The final major human cause of desertification is soil
salinization resulting from overirrigation. Excess water
from irrigation sinks down into the water table. If no
drainage system exists, the water table rises, bringing
dissolved salts to the surface. The water evaporates
and the salts are left behind, creating a white crustal
layer that prevents air and water from reaching the
underlying soil.
The extreme seriousness of desertification results
from the vast areas of land and the tremendous
numbers of people affected, as well as from the great
difficulty of reversing or even slowing the process.
Once the soil has been removed by erosion, only the
passage of centuries or millennia will enable new soil
to form. In areas where considerable soil still remains,
though, a rigorously enforced program of land
protection and cover-crop planting may make it
possible to reverse the present deterioration of the
surface.
28
01 – 3 Timberline Vegetation on Mountains
The transition from forest to treeless tundra on a
mountain slope is often a dramatic one. Within a
vertical distance of just a few tens of meters, trees
disappear as a life-form and are replaced by low
shrubs, herbs, and grasses. This rapid zone of
transition is called the upper timberline or tree line.
In many semiarid areas there is also a lower
timberline where the forest passes into steppe or
desert at its lower edge, usually because of a lack
of moisture.
The upper timberline, like the snow line, is highest
in the tropics and lowest in the Polar Regions. It
ranges from sea level in the Polar Regions to 4,500
meters in the dry subtropics and 3,500-4,500
meters in the moist tropics. Timberline trees are
normally evergreens, suggesting that these have
some advantage over deciduous trees (those that
lose their leaves) in the extreme environments of
the upper timberline. There are some areas,
however, where broadleaf deciduous trees form the
timberline. Species of birch, for example, may
occur at the timberline in parts of the Himalayas.
At the upper timberline the trees begin to become
twisted and deformed. This is particularly true for
trees in the middle and upper latitudes, which tend
to attain greater heights on ridges, whereas in the
tropics the trees reach their greater heights in the
valleys. This is because middle- and upper- latitude
timberlines are strongly influenced by the duration
and depth of the snow cover. As the snow is
deeper and lasts longer in the valleys, trees tend to
attain greater heights on the ridges, even though
they are more exposed to high-velocity winds and
poor, thin soils there. In the tropics, the valleys
appear to be more favorable because they are less
prone to dry out, they have less frost, and they
have deeper soils.
There is still no universally agreed-on explanation
for why there should be such a dramatic cessation
of tree growth at the upper timberline. Various
environmental factors may play a role. Too much
snow, for example, can smother trees, and
avalanches and snow creep can damage or
destroy them. Late-lying snow reduces the effective
growing season to the point where seedlings
cannot establish themselves. Wind velocity also
increases with altitude and may cause serious
stress for trees, as is made evident by the
deformed shapes at high altitudes. Some scientists
have proposed that the presence of increasing
levels of ultraviolet light with elevation may play a
role, while browsing and grazing animals like the
ibex may be another contributing factor. Probably
the most important environmental factor is
temperature, for if the growing season is too short
and temperatures are too low, tree shoots and
buds cannot mature sufficiently to survive the
winter months.
Above the tree line there is a zone that is generally
called alpine tundra. Immediately adjacent to the
timberline, the tundra consists of a fairly complete
cover of low-lying shrubs, herbs, and grasses,
while higher up the number and diversity of species
decrease until there is much bare ground with
occasional mosses and lichens and some prostrate
cushion plants. Some plants can even survive in
favorable microhabitats above the snow line. The
highest plants in the world occur at around 6,100
meters on Makalu in the Himalayas. At this great
height, rocks, warmed by the sun, melt small
snowdrifts.
The most striking characteristic of the plants of the
alpine zone is their low growth form. This enables
them to avoid the worst rigors of high winds and
permits them to make use of the higher
temperatures immediately adjacent to the ground
surface. In an area where low temperatures are
limiting to life, the importance of the additional heat
near the surface is crucial. The low growth form
can also permit the plants to take advantage of the
insulation provided by a winter snow cover. In the
equatorial mountains the low growth form is less
prevalent.
29
03 – 3 The Long-Term Stability of Ecosystems
Plant communities assemble themselves flexibly,
and their particular structure depends on the
specific history of the area. Ecologists use the term
“succession” to refer to the changes that happen in
plant communities and ecosystems over time. The
first community in a succession is called a pioneer
community, while the long-lived community at the
end of succession is called a climax community.
Pioneer and successional plant communities are
said to change over periods from 1 to 500 years.
These changes—in plant numbers and the mix of
species—are cumulative. Climax communities
themselves change but over periods of time greater
than about 500 years.
An ecologist who studies a pond today may well
find it relatively unchanged in a year’s
time.Individual fish may be replaced, but the
number of fish will tend to be the same from one
year to the next. We can say that the properties of
an ecosystem are more stable than the individual
organisms that compose the ecosystem.
At one time, ecologists believed that species
diversity made ecosystems stable. They believed
that the greater the diversity the more stable the
ecosystem. Support for this idea came from the
observation that long-lasting climax communities
usually have more complex food webs and more
species diversity than pioneer communities.
Ecologists concluded that the apparent stability of
climax ecosystems depended on their complexity.
To take an extreme example, farmlands dominated
by a single crop are so unstable that one year of
bad weather or the invasion of a single pest can
destroy the entire crop. In contrast, a complex
climax community, such as a temperate forest, will
tolerate considerable damage from weather to
pests.
The question of ecosystem stability is complicated,
however. The first problem is that ecologists do not
all agree what “stability” means. Stability can be
defined as simply lack of change. In that case, the
climax community would be considered the most
stable, since, by definition, it changes the least
over time. Alternatively, stability can be defined as
the speed with which an ecosystem returns to a
particular form following a major disturbance, such
as a fire. This kind of stability is also called
resilience. In that case, climax communities would
be the most fragile and the least stable, since they
can require hundreds of yearsto return to the
climax state.
Even the kind of stability defined as simple lack of
change is not always associated with maximum
diversity. At least in temperate zones, maximum
diversity is often found in mid-successional stages,
not in the climax community. Once a redwood
forest matures, for example, the kinds of species
and the number of individuals growing on the forest
floor are reduced. In general, diversity, by itself,
does not ensure stability. Mathematical models of
ecosystems likewise suggest that diversity does not
guarantee ecosystem stability—just the opposite, in
fact. A more complicated system is, in general,
more likely than a simple system to break down. A
fifteen-speed racing bicycle is more likely to break
down than a child’s tricycle.
Ecologists are especially interested to know what
factors contribute to the resilience of communities
because climax communities all over the world are
being severely damaged or destroyed by human
activities. The destruction caused by the volcanic
explosion of Mount St. Helens, in the northwestern
United States, for example, pales in comparison to
the destruction caused by humans. We need to
know what aspects of a community are most
important to the community’s resistance to
destruction, as well as its recovery.
Many ecologists now think that the relative longterm stability of climax communities comes not
from diversity but from the “patchiness” of the
environment, an environment that varies from place
to place supports more kinds of organisms than an
environment that is uniform. A local population that
goes extinct is quickly replaced by immigrants from
an adjacent community. Even if the new population
is of a different species, it can approximately fill the
niche vacated by the extinct population and keep
the food web intact.

07 – 1 The Geologic History of the
Mediterranean
In 1970 geologists Kenneth J. Hsu and William B.F.
Ryan were collecting research data while aboard
the oceanographic research vessel Glomar
Challenger. An objective of this particular cruise
was to investigate the floor of the Mediterranean
and to resolve questions about its geologic history.
One question was related to evidence that the
invertebrate fauna (animals without spines) of the
Mediterranean had changed abruptly about 6
million years ago. Most of the older organisms were
nearly wiped out, although a few hardy species
survived. A few managed to migrate into the
Atlantic. Somewhat later, the migrants returned,
bringing new species with them. Why did the near
extinction and migrations occur?
Another task for the Glomar Challenger’s scientists
was to try to determine the origin of the domelike
masses buried deep beneath the Mediterranean
seafloor. These structures had been detected
years earlier by echo-sounding instruments, but
they had never been penetrated in the course of
drilling. Were they salt domes such as are common
along the United States Gulf Coast, and if so, why
should there have been so much solid crystalline
salt beneath the floor of the Mediterranean?
With question such as these clearly before them,
the scientists aboard the Glomar Challenger
processed to the Mediterranean to search for the
answers. On August 23, 1970, they recovered a
sample. The sample consisted of pebbles of
hardened sediment that had once been soft, deepsea mud, as well as granules of gypsum and
fragments of volcanic rock. Not a single pebble was
found that might have indicated that the pebbles
came from the nearby continent. In the days
following, samples of solid gypsum were repeatedly
brought on deck as drilling operations penetrated
the seafloor. Furthermore, the gypsum was found
to possess peculiarities of composition and
structure that suggested it had formed on desert
flats. Sediment above and below the gypsum layer
contained tiny marine fossils, indicating openocean conditions. As they drilled into the central
and deepest part of the Mediterranean basin, the
scientists took solid, shiny, crystalline salt from the
core barrel. Interbedded with the salt were thin
layers of what appeared to be windblown silt.
The time had come to formulate a hypothesis. The
investigators theorized that about 20 million years
ago, the Mediterranean was a broad seaway linked
to the Atlantic by two narrow straits. Crustal
movements closed the straits, and the landlocked
Mediterranean began to evaporate. Increasing
salinity caused by the evaporation resulted in the
extermination of scores of invertebrate species.
Only a few organisms especially tolerant of very
salty conditions remained. As evaporation
continued, the remaining brine (salt water) became
so dense that the calcium sulfate of the hard layer
was precipitated. In the central deeper part of the
basin, the last of the brine evaporated to precipitate
more soluble sodium chloride (salt). Later, under
the weight of overlying sediments, this salt flowed
plastically upward to form salt domes. Before this
happened, however, the Mediterranean was a vast
desert 3,000 meters deep. Then, about 5.5 million
years ago came the deluge. As a result of crustal
adjustments and faulting, the Strait of Gibraltar,
where the Mediterranean now connects to the
Atlantic, opened, and water cascaded spectacularly
back into the Mediterranean. Turbulent waters tore
into the hardened salt flats, broke them up, and
ground them into the pebbles observed in the first
sample taken by the Challenger. As the basin was
refilled, normal marine organisms returned. Soon
layer of oceanic ooze began to accumulate above
the old hard layer. The salt and gypsum, the faunal
changes, and the unusual gravel provided
abundant evidence that the Mediterranean was
once a desert.

10 – 2 Variations in the Climate
One of the most difficult aspects of deciding
whether current climatic events reveal evidence of
the impact of human activities is that it is hard to
get a measure of what constitutes the natural
variability of the climate. We know that over the
past millennia the climate has undergone major
changes without any significant human
intervention. We also know that the global climate
system is immensely complicated and that
everything is in some way connected, and so the
system is capable of fluctuating in unexpected
ways. We need therefore to know how much the
climate can vary of its own accord in order to
interpret with confidence the extent to which recent
changes are natural as opposed to being the result
of human activities.
Instrumental records do not go back far enough to
provide us with reliable measurements of global
climatic variability on timescales longer than a
century. What we do know is that as we include
longer time intervals, the record shows increasing
evidence of slow swings in climate between
different regimes. To build up a better picture of
fluctuations appreciably further back in time
requires us to use proxy records.
Over long period of time, substances whose
physical and chemical properties change with the
ambient climate at the time can be deposited in a
systematic way to provide a continuous record of
changes in those properties overtime, sometimes
for hundreds or thousands of years. Generally, the
layering occurs on an annual basis, hence the
observed changes in the records can be dated.
Information on temperature, rainfall, and other
aspects of the climate that can be inferred from the
systematic changes in properties is usually referred
to as proxy data. Proxy temperature records have
been reconstructed from ice core drilled out of the
central Greenland ice cap, calcite shells embedded
in layered lake sediments in Western Europe,
ocean floor sediment cores from the tropical
Atlantic Ocean, ice cores from Peruvian glaciers,
and ice cores from eastern Antarctica. While these
records provide broadly consistent indications that
temperature variations can occur on a global scale,
there are nonetheless some intriguing differences,
which suggest that the pattern of temperature
variations in regional climates can also differ
significantly from each other.
What the proxy records make abundantly clear is
that there have been significant natural changes in
the climate over timescales longer than a few
thousand years. Equally striking, however, is the
relative stability of the climate in the past 10,000
years (the Holocene period).
To the extent that the coverage of the global
climate from these records can provide a measure
of its true variability, it should at least indicate how
all the natural causes of climate change have
combined. These include the chaotic fluctuations of
the atmosphere, the slower but equally erratic
behavior of the oceans, changes in the land
surfaces, and the extent of ice and snow. Also
included will be any variations that have arisen
from volcanic activity, solar activity, and, possibly,
human activities.
One way to estimate how all the various processes
leading to climate variability will combine is by
using computer models of the global climate. They
can do only so much to represent the full
complexity of the global climate and hence may
give only limited information about natural
variability. Studies suggest that to date the
variability in computer simulations is considerably
smaller than in data obtained from the proxy
records.
In addition to the internal variability of the global
climate system itself, there is the added factor of
external influences, such as volcanoes and solar
activity. There is a growing body of opinion that
both these physical variations have a measurable
impact on the climate. Thus we need to be able to
include these in our deliberations. Some current
analyses conclude that volcanoes and solar activity
explain quite a considerable amount of the
observed variability in the period from the
seventeenth to the early twentieth centuries, but
that they cannot be invoked to explain the rapid
warming in recent decades.
32
12 – 3 Water in the Desert
Rainfall is not completely absent in desert areas,
but it is highly variable. An annual rainfall of four
inches is often used to define the limits of a desert.
The impact of rainfall upon the surface water and
groundwater resources of the desert is greatly
influenced by landforms. Flats and depressions
where water can collect are common features, but
they make up only a small part of the landscape.
Arid lands, surprisingly, contain some of the world’s
largest river systems, such as the Murray-Darling in
Australia, the Rio Grande in North America, the
Indus in Asia, and the Nile in Africa. These rivers
and river systems are known as “exogenous”
because their sources lie outside the arid zone.
They are vital for sustaining life in some of the
driest parts of the world. For centuries, the annual
floods of the Nile, Tigris, and Euphrates, for
example, have brought fertile silts and water to the
inhabitants of their lower valleys. Today, river
discharges are increasingly controlled by human
intervention, creating a need for international riverbasin agreements. The filling of the Ataturk and
other dams in Turkey has drastically reduced flows
in the Euphrates, with potentially serious
consequences for Syria and Iraq.
The flow of exogenous rivers varies with the
season. The desert sections of long rivers respond
several months after rain has fallen outside the
desert, so that peak flows may be in the dry
season. This is useful for irrigation, but the high
temperatures, low humidity, and different day
lengths of the dry season, compared to the normal
growing season, can present difficulties with some
crops.
Regularly flowing rivers and streams that originate
within arid lands are known as “endogenous”.
These are generally fed by groundwater springs,
and many issue from limestone massifs, such as
the Atlas Mountains in Morocco. Basaltic rocks also
support springs, notably at the Jabal Al-Arab on the
Jordan-Syria border. Endogenous rivers often do
not reach the sea but drain into inland basins,
where the water evaporates or is lost in the ground.
Most desert streambeds are normally dry, but they
occasionally receive large flows of water and
sediment.
Deserts contain large amounts of groundwater
when compared to the amounts they hold in
surface stores such as lakes and rivers. But only a
small fraction of groundwater enters the
hydrological cycle—feeding the flows of streams,
maintaining lake levels, and being recharged (or
refilled) through surface flows and rainwater. In
recent years, groundwater has become an
increasingly important source of freshwater for
desert dwellers. The United Nations Environment
Programme and the World Bank have funded
attempts to survey the groundwater resources of
arid lands and to develop appropriate extraction
techniques. Such programs are much needed
because in many arid lands there is only a vague
idea of the extent of groundwater resources. It is
known, however, that the distribution of
groundwater is uneven, and that much of it lies at
great depths.
Groundwater is stored in the pore spaces and
joints of rocks and unconsolidated (unsolidified)
sediments or in the openings widened through
fractures and weathering. The water-saturated rock
or sediment is known as an “aquifer”. Because they
are porous, sedimentary rocks, such as sandstones
and conglomerates, are important potential sources
of groundwater. Large quantities of water may also
be stored in limestones when joints and cracks
have been enlarged to form cavities. Most
limestone and sandstone aquifers are deep and
extensive but may contain groundwater that are not
being recharged. Most shallow aquifers in sand
and gravel deposits produce lower yields, but they
can be rapidly recharged. Some deep aquifers are
known as “fossil waters”. The term “fossil”
describes water that has been present for several
thousand years. These aquifers became saturated
more than 10,000 years ago and are no longer
being recharged.
Water does not remain immobile in an aquifer but
can seep out at springs or leak into other aquifers.
The rate of movement may be very slow: in the
Indus plain, the movement of saline (salty)
groundwater has still not reached equilibrium after
70 years of being tapped. The mineral content of
groundwater normally increases with the depth, but
even quite shallow aquifers can be highly saline.
33
15 – 3 Glacier Formation
Glaciers are slowly moving masses of ice that have
accumulated on land in areas where more
snowfalls during a year than melts. Snow falls as
hexagonal crystals, but once on the ground, snow
is soon transformed into a compacted mass of
smaller, rounded grains. As the air space around
them is lessened by compaction and melting, the
grains become denser. With further melting,
refreezing, and increased weight from newer
snowfall above, the snow reaches a granular
recrystallized stage intermediate between flakes
and ice known as firn. With additional time,
pressure, and refrozen meltwater from above, the
small firn granules become larger, interlocked
crystals of blue glacial ice. When the ice is thick
enough, usually over 30 meters, the weight of the
snow and firn will cause the ice crystals toward the
bottom to become plastic and to flow outward or
downward from the area of snow accumulation.
Glaciers are open systems, with snow as the
system’s input and meltwater as the system’s main
output. The glacial system is governed by two basic
climatic variables: precipitation and temperature.
For a glacier to grow or maintain its mass, there
must be sufficient snowfall to match or exceed the
annual loss through melting, evaporation, and
calving, which occurs when the glacier loses solid
chunks as icebergs to the sea or to large lakes. If
summer temperatures are high for too long, then all
the snowfall from the previous winter will melt.
Surplus snowfall is essential for a glacier to
develop. A surplus allows snow to accumulate and
for the pressure of snow accumulated over the
years to transform buried snow into glacial ice with
a depth great enough for the ice to flow. Glaciers
are sometimes classified by temperature as fasterflowing temperate glaciers or as slower-flowing
polar glaciers.
Glaciers are part of Earth’s hydrologic cycle and
are second only to the oceans in the total amount
of water contained. About 2 percent of Earth’s
water is currently frozen as ice. Two percent may
be a deceiving figure, however, since over 80
percent of the world’s freshwater is locked up as
ice in glaciers, with the majority of it in Antarctica.
The total amount of ice is even more awesome if
we estimate the water released upon the
hypothetical melting of the world’s glaciers. Sea
level would rise about 60 meters. This would
change the geography of the planet considerably.
In contrast, should another ice age occur, sea level
would drop drastically. During the last ice age, sea
level dropped about 120 meters.
When snow falls on high mountains or in Polar
regions, it may become part of the glacial system.
Unlike rain, which returns rapidly to the sea or
atmosphere, the snow that becomes part of a
glacier is involved in a much more slowly cycling
system. Here water may be stored in ice form for
hundreds or even hundreds of thousands of years
before being released again into the liquid water
system as meltwater. In the meantime, however,
this ice is not static. Glaciers move slowly across
the land with tremendous energy, carving into even
the hardest rock formations and thereby reshaping
the landscape as they engulf, push, drag, and
finally deposit rock debris in places far from its
original location. As a result, glaciers create a great
variety of landforms that remain long after the
surface is released from its icy covering.
Throughout most of Earth’s history, glaciers did not
exist, but at the present time about 10 percent of
Earth’s land surface is covered by glaciers.
Present-day glaciers are found in Antarctica, in
Greenland, and at high elevations on all the
continents except Australia. In the recent past, from
about 2.4 million to about 10,000 years ago, nearly
a third of Earth’s land area was periodically
covered by ice thousands of meters thick. In the
much more distant past, other ice ages have
occurred.

18 – 3 Lightning
Lightning is a brilliant flash of light produced by an
electrical discharge from a storm cloud. The
electrical discharge takes place when the attractive
tension between a region of negatively charged
particles and a region of positively charged
particles becomes so great that the charged
particles suddenly rush together. The coming
together of the oppositely charged particles
neutralizes the electrical tension and releases a
tremendous amount of energy, which we see as
lightning. The separation of positively and
negatively charged particles takes place during the
development of the storm cloud.
The separation of charged particles that forms in a
storm cloud has a sandwich-like structure.
Concentrations of positively charged particles
develop at the top and bottom of the cloud, but the
middle region becomes negatively charged. Recent
measurements made in the field together with
laboratory simulations offer a promising explanation
of how this structure of charged particles forms.
What happens is that small (millimeter-to
centimeter-size) pellets of ice form in the cold
upper regions of the cloud. When these ice pellets
fall, some of them strike much smaller ice crystals
in the center of the cloud. The temperature at the
center of the cloud is about -15℃ or lower. At such
temperatures, the collision between the ice pellets
and the ice crystals causes electrical charges to
shift so that the ice pellets acquire a negative
charge and the ice crystals become positively
charged. Then updraft wind currents carry the light,
positively charged ice crystals up to the top of the
cloud. The heavier negatively charged ice pellets
are left to concentrate in the center. This process
explains why the top of the cloud becomes
positively charged, while the center becomes
negatively charged. The negatively charged region
is large: several hundred meters thick and several
kilometers in diameter. Below this large, cold,
negatively charged region, the cloud is warmer
than -15℃, and at these temperatures, collisions
between ice crystals and falling ice pellets produce
positively charged ice pellets that then populate a
small region at the base of the cloud.
Most lightning takes place within a cloud when the
charge separation within the cloud collapses.
However, as the storm cloud develops, the ground
beneath the cloud becomes positively charged and
lightning can take place in the form of an electrical
discharge between the negative charge of the
cloud and the positively charged ground. Lightning
that strikes the ground is the most likely to be
destructive, so even though it represents only 20
percent of all lightning, it has received a lot of
scientific attention.
Using high-speed photography, scientists have
determined that there are two steps to the
occurrence of lightning from a cloud to the ground.
First, a channel, or path, is formed that connects
the cloud and the ground. Then a strong current of
electrons follows that path from the cloud to the
ground, and it is that current that illuminates the
channel as the lightning we see.
The formation of the channel is initiated when
electrons surge from the cloud base toward the
ground. When a stream of these negatively
charged electrons comes within 100 meters of the
ground it is met by a stream of positively charged
particles that comes up from the ground. When the
negatively and positively charged streams meet, a
complete channel connecting the cloud and the
ground is formed. The channel is only a few
centimeters in diameter, but that is wide enough for
electrons to follow the channel to the ground in the
visible form of a flash of lightning. The stream of
positive particles that meets the surge of electrons
from the cloud often arises from a tall pointed
structure such as a metal flagpole or a tower. That
is why the subsequent lightning that follows the
completed channel often strikes a tall structure.
Once a channel has been formed, it is usually used
by several lightning discharges, each of them
consisting of a stream of electrons from the cloud
meeting a stream of positive particles along the
established path. Sometimes, however, a stream of
electrons following an established channel is met
by a positive stream making a new path up from
the ground. The result is a forked lightning that
strikes the ground in two places.
35
19 – 3 Discovering the Ice Ages
In the middle of the nineteenth century, Louis
Agassiz, one of the first scientists to study glaciers,
immigrated to the United States from Switzerland
and became a professor at Harvard University,
where he continued his studies in geology and
other sciences. For his research, Agassiz visited
many places in the northern parts of Europe and
North America, from the mountains of Scandinavia
and New England to the rolling hills of the
American Midwest. In all these diverse regions,
Agassiz saw signs of glacial erosion and
sedimentation. In flat plains country, he saw
moraines (accumulations of earth and loose rock
that form at the edges of glaciers) that reminded
him of the terminal moraines found at the end of
valley glaciers in the Alps. The heterogeneous
material of the drift (sand, clay, and rocks
deposited there) convinced him of its glacial origin.
The areas covered by this material were so vast
that the ice that deposited it must have been a
continental glacier larger than Greenland or
Antarctica. Eventually, Agassiz and others
convinced geologists and the general public that a
great continental glaciation had extended the polar
ice caps far into regions that now enjoy temperate
climates. For the first time, people began to talk
about ice ages. It was also apparent that the
glaciation occurred in the relatively recent past
because the drift was soft, like freshly deposited
sediment. We now know the age of the glaciation
accurately from radiometric dating of the carbon-14
in logs buried in the drift. The drift of the last
glaciation was deposited during one of the most
recent epochs of geologic time, the Pleistocene,
which lasted from 1.8 million to 10,000 years ago.
Along the east coast of the United States, the
southernmost advance of this ice is recorded by
the enormous sand and drift deposits of the
terminal moraines that form Long Island and Cape
Cod.
It soon became clear that there were multiple
glacial ages during the Pleistocene, with warmer
interglacial intervals between them. As geologists
mapped glacial deposits in the late nineteenth
century, they became aware that there were
several layers of drift, the lower ones
corresponding to earlier ice ages. Between the
older layers of glacial material were well-developed
soils containing fossils of warm-climate plants.
These soils were evidence that the glaciers
retreated as the climate warmed. By the early part
of the twentieth century, scientists believed that
four distinct glaciations had affected North America
and Europe during the Pleistocene epoch.
This idea was modified in the late twentieth
century, when geologists and oceanographers
examining oceanic sediment found fossil evidence
of warming and cooling of the oceans. Ocean
sediments presented a much more complete
geologic record of the Pleistocene than continental
glacial deposits did. The fossils buried in
Pleistocene and earlier ocean sediments were of
foraminifera—small, single-celled marine
organisms that secrete shells of calcium carbonate,
or calcite. These shells differ in their proportion of
ordinary oxygen (oxygen-16) and the heavy oxygen
isotope (oxygen-18). The ratio of oxygen-16 to
oxygen-18 found in the calcite of a foraminifer's
shell depends on the temperature of the water in
which the organism lived. Different ratios in the
shells preserved in various layers of sediment
reveal the temperature changes in the oceans
during the Pleistocene epoch.
Isotopic analysis of shells allowed geologists to
measure another glacial effect. They could trace
the growth and shrinkage of continental glaciers,
even in parts of the ocean where there may have
been no great change in temperature—around the
equator, for example. The oxygen isotope ratio of
the ocean changes as a great deal of water is
withdrawn from it by evaporation and is precipitated
as snow to form glacial ice. During glaciations, the
lighter oxygen-16 has a greater tendency to
evaporate from the ocean surface than the heavier
oxygen-18 does. Thus, more of the heavy isotope
is left behind in the ocean and absorbed by marine
organisms. From this analysis of marine sediments,
geologists have learned that there were many
shorter, more regular cycles of glaciation and
deglaciation than geologists had recognized from
the glacial drift of the continents alone.
36
22 – 3 The Allende Meteorite
Sometime after midnight on February 8, 1969, a
large, bright meteor entered Earth’s atmosphere
and broke into thousands of pieces, plummeted to
the ground, and scattered over an area 50 miles
long and 10 miles wide in the state of Chihuahua in
Mexico. The first meteorite from this fall was found
in the village of Pueblito de Allende. Altogether,
roughly two tons of meteorite fragments were
recovered, all of which bear the name Allende for
the location of the first discovery.
Individual specimens of Allende are covered with a
black, glassy crust that formed when their exteriors
melted as they were slowed by Earth’s
atmosphere. When broken open, Allende stones
are revealed to contain an assortment of small,
distinctive objects, spherical or irregular in shape
and embedded in a dark gray matrix (binding
material), which were once constituents of the solar
nebula — the interstellar cloud of gas and dust out
of which our solar system was formed.
The Allende meteorite is classified as a chondrite.
Chondrites take their name from the Greek word
chondros — meaning “seed” — an allusion to their
appearance as rocks containing tiny seeds. These
seeds are actually chondrules: millimeter-sized
melted droplets of silicate material that were cooled
into spheres of glass and crystal. A few chondrules
contain grains that survived the melting event, so
these enigmatic chondrules must have formed
when compact masses of nebular dust were fused
at high temperatures — approaching 1,700
degrees Celsius — and then cooled before these
surviving grains could melt. Study of the textures of
chondrules confirms that they cooled rather quickly,
in times measured in minutes or hours, so the
heating events that formed them must have been
localized. It seems very unlikely that large portions
of the nebula were heated to such extreme
temperatures, and huge nebula areas could not
possibly have lost heat so fast. Chondrules must
have been melted in small pockets of the nebula
that were able to lose heat rapidly. The origin of
these peculiar glassy spheres remains an enigma.
Equally perplexing constituents of Allende are the
refractory inclusions: irregular white masses that
tend to be larger than chondrules. They are
composed of minerals uncommon on Earth, all rich
in calcium, aluminum, and titanium, the most
refractory (resistant to melting) of the major
elements in the nebula. The same minerals that
occur in refractory inclusions are believed to be the
earliest-formed substances to have condensed out
of the solar nebula. However, studies of the
textures of inclusions reveal that the order in which
the minerals appeared in the inclusions varies from
inclusion to inclusion, and often does not match the
theoretical condensation sequence for those
metals.
Chondrules and inclusions in Allende are held
together by the chondrite matrix, a mixture of finegrained, mostly silicate minerals that also includes
grains of iron metal and iron sulfide. At one time it
was thought that these matrix grains might be
pristine nebular dust, the sort of stuff from which
chondrules and inclusions were made. However,
detailed studies of the chondrite matrix suggest
that much of it, too, has been formed by
condensation or melting in the nebula, although
minute amounts of surviving interstellar dust are
mixed with the processed materials.
All these diverse constituents are aggregated
together to form chondritic meteorites, like Allende,
that have chemical compositions much like that of
the Sun. To compare the compositions of a
meteorite and the Sun, it is necessary that we use
ratios of elements rather than simply the
abundances of atoms. After all, the Sun has many
more atoms of any element, say iron, than does a
meteorite specimen, but the ratios of iron to silicon
in the two kinds of matter might be comparable.
The compositional similarity is striking. The major
difference is that Allende is depleted in the most
volatile elements, like hydrogen, carbon, oxygen,
nitrogen, and the noble gases, relative to the Sun.
These are the elements that tend to form gases
even at very low temperatures. We might think of
chondrites as samples of distilled Sun, a sort of
solar sludge from which only gases have been
removed. Since practically all the solar system’s
mass resides in the Sun, this similarity in chemistry
means that chondrites have average solar system
composition, except for the most volatile elements;
they are truly lumps of nebular matter, probably
similar in composition to the matter from which
planets were assembled.

23 – 1 Urban Climates
The city is an extraordinary processor of mass and
energy and has its own metabolism. A daily input of
water, food, and energy of various kinds is
matched by an output of sewage, solid waste, air
pollutants, energy, and materials that have been
transformed in some way. The quantities involved
are enormous. Many aspects of this energy use
affect the atmosphere of a city, particularly in the
production of heat.
In winter the heat produced by a city can equal or
surpass the amount of heat available from the Sun.
All the heat that warms a building eventually
transfers to the surrounding air, a process that is
quickest where houses are poorly insulated. But an
automobile produces enough heat to warm an
average house in winter, and if a house were
perfectly insulated, one adult could also produce
more than enough heat to warm it. Therefore, even
without any industrial production of heat, an urban
area tends to be warmer than the countryside that
surrounds it.
The burning of fuel, such as by cars, is not the only
source of this increased heat. Two other factors
contribute to the higher overall temperature in
cities. The first is the heat capacity of the materials
that constitute the city, which is typically dominated
by concrete and asphalt. During the day, heat from
the Sun can be conducted into these materials and
stored—to be released at night. But in the
countryside materials have a significantly lower
heat capacity because a vegetative blanket
prevents heat from easily flowing into and out of
the ground. The second factor is that radiant heat
coming into the city from the Sun is trapped in two
ways: (1) by a continuing series of reflection among
the numerous vertical surfaces that buildings
present and (2) by the dust dome, the cloudlike
layer of polluted air that most cities produce.
Shortwave radiation from the Sun passes through
the pollution dome more easily than outgoing
longwave radiation does; the latter is absorbed by
the gaseous pollutants of the dome and reradiated
back to the urban surface.
Cities, then, are warmer than the surrounding rural
areas, and together they produce a phenomenon
known as the urban heat island. Heat islands
develop best under particular conditions associated
with light winds, but they can form almost any time.
The precise configuration of a heat island depends
on several factors. For example, the wind can
make a heat island stretch in the direction it blows.
When a heat island is well developed, variations
can be extreme; in winter, busy streets in cities can
be 1.7℃ warmer than the side streets. Areas near
traffic lights can be similarly warmer than the areas
between them because of the effect of cars
standing in traffic instead of moving. The maximum
differences in temperature between neighboring
urban and rural environments is called the heatisland intensity for that region. In general, the larger
the city, the greater its heat-island intensity. The
actual level of intensity depends on such factors as
the physical layout, population density, and
productive activities of a metropolis.
The surface-atmosphere relationships inside
metropolitan areas produce a number of climatic
peculiarities. For one thing, the presence or
absence of moisture is affected by the special
qualities of the urban surface. With much of the
built-up landscape impenetrable by water, even
gentle rain runs off almost immediately from
rooftops, streets, and parking lots. Thus, city
surfaces, as well as the air above them, tend to be
drier between episodes of rain; with little water
available for the cooling process of evaporation,
relative humidity is usually lower. Wind movements
are also modified in cities because buildings
increase the friction on air flowing around them.
This friction tends to slow the speed of winds,
making them far less efficient at dispersing
pollutants. On the other hand, air turbulence
increases because of the effect of skyscrapers on
airflow. Rainfall is also increased in cities. The
cause appears to be in part greater turbulence in
the urban atmosphere as hot air rises from the
built-up surface.
38
24 – 1 Lake Water
Where does the water in a lake come from, and
how does water leave it? Water enters a lake from
inflowing rivers, from underwater seeps and
springs, from overland flow off the surrounding
land, and from rain falling directly on the lake
surface. Water leaves a lake via outflowing rivers,
by soaking into the bed of the lake, and by
evaporation. So much is obvious.
The questions become more complicated when
actual volumes of water are considered: how much
water enters and leaves by each route?
Discovering the inputs and outputs of rivers is a
matter of measuring the discharges of every
inflowing and outflowing stream and river. Then
exchanges with the atmosphere are calculated by
finding the difference between the gains from rain,
as measured (rather roughly) by rain gauges, and
the losses by evaporation, measured with models
that correct for the other sources of water loss. For
the majority of lakes, certainly those surrounded by
forests, input from overland flow is too small to
have a noticeable effect. Changes in lake level not
explained by river flows plus exchanges with the
atmosphere must be due to the net difference
between what seeps into the lake from the
groundwater and what leaks into the groundwater.
Note the word "net": measuring the actual amounts
of groundwater seepage into the lake and out of
the lake is a much more complicated matter than
merely inferring their difference.
Once all this information has been gathered, it
becomes possible to judge whether a lake’s flow is
mainly due to its surface inputs and outputs or to its
underground inputs and outputs. If the former are
greater, the lake is a surface-water-dominated lake;
if the latter, it is a seepage-dominated lake.
Occasionally, common sense tells you which of
these two possibilities applies. For example, a
pond in hilly country that maintains a steady water
level all through a dry summer in spite of having no
streams flowing into it must obviously be seepage
dominated. Conversely, a pond with a stream
flowing in one end and out the other, which dries
up when the stream dries up, is clearly surface
water dominated.
By whatever means, a lake is constantly gaining
water and losing water: its water does not just sit
there, or, anyway, not for long. This raises the
matter of a lake’s residence time. The residence
time is the average length of time that any
particular molecule of water remains in the lake,
and it is calculated by dividing the volume of water
in the lake by the rate at which water leaves the
lake. The residence time is an average; the time
spent in the lake by a given molecule (if we could
follow its fate) would depend on the route it took: it
might flow through as part of the fastest, most
direct current, or it might circle in a backwater for
an indefinitely long time.
Residence times vary enormously. They range
from a few days for small lakes up to several
hundred years for large ones; Lake Tahoe, in
California, has a residence time of 700 years. The
residence times for the Great Lakes of North
America, namely, Lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron,
Erie, and Ontario, are, respectively, 190, 100, 22,
2.5, and 6 years. Lake Erie’s is the lowest:
although its area is larger than Lake Ontario’ s, its
volume is less than one-third as great because it is
so shallow — less than 20 meters on average.
A given lake’s residence time is by no means a
fixed quantity. It depends on the rate at which
water enters the lake, and that depends on the
rainfall and the evaporation rate. Climatic change
(the result of global warming?) is dramatically
affecting the residence times of some lakes in
northwestern Ontario, Canada. In the period 1970
to 1986, rainfall in the area decreased from 1,000
millimeters to 650 millimeters per annum, while
above-average temperatures speeded up the
evapotranspiration rate (the rate at which water is
lost to the atmosphere through evaporation and the
processes of plant life). The result has been that
the residence time of one of the lakes increased
from 5 to 18 years during the study period. The
slowing down of water renewal leads to a chain of
further consequences; it causes dissolved
chemicals to become increasingly concentrated,
and this, in turn, has a marked effect on all living
things in the lake.

27 – 2 The Formation of Volcanic Islands
Earth's surface is not made up of a single sheet of
rock that forms a crust but rather a number of
"tectonic plates" that fit closely, like the pieces of a
giant jigsaw puzzle. Some plates carry islands or
continents; others form the seafloor. All are slowly
moving because the plates float on a denser semiliquid mantle, the layer between the crust and
Earth's core. The plates have edges that are
spreading ridges (where two plates are moving
apart and new seafloor is being created),
subduction zones (where two plates collide and
one plunges beneath the other), or transform faults
(where two plates neither converge nor diverge but
merely move past one another). It is at the
boundaries between plates that most of Earth's
volcanism and earthquake activity occur.
Generally speaking, the interiors of plates are
geologically uneventful. However, there are
exceptions. A glance at a map of the Pacific Ocean
reveals that there are many islands far out at sea
that are actually volcanoes - many no longer active,
some overgrown with coral - that originated from
activity at points in the interior of the Pacific Plate
that forms the Pacific seafloor.
How can volcanic activity occur so far from a plate
boundary? The Hawaiian Islands provide a very
instructive answer. Like many other island groups,
they form a chain. The Hawaiian Islands Chain
extends northwest from the island of Hawaii. In the
1840s American geologist James Daly observed
that the different Hawaii islands seem to share a
similar geologic evolution but are progressively
more eroded, and therefore probably older, toward
the northwest. Then in 1963, in the early days of
the development of the theory of plate tectonics,
Canadian geophysicist Tuzo Wilson realized that
this age progression could result if the islands were
formed on a surface plate moving over a fixed
volcanic source in the interior. Wilson suggested
that the long chain of volcanoes stretching
northwest from Hawaii is simply the surface
expression of a long-lived volcanic source located
beneath the tectonic plate in the mantle. Today's
most northwest island would have been the first to
form. Then as the plate moved slowly northwest,
new volcanic islands would have formed as the
plate moved over the volcanic source. The most
recent island, Hawaii, would be at the end of the
chain and is now over the volcanic source.
Although this idea was not immediately accepted,
the dating of lavas in the Hawaii (and other) chains
showed that their ages increase away from the
presently active volcano, just as Daly had
suggested. Wilson's analysis of these data is now a
central part of plate tectonics. Most volcanoes that
occur in the interiors of plates are believed to be
produced by mantle plumes, columns of molten
rock that rise from deep within the mantle. A
volcano remains an active "hot spot" as long as it is
over the plume. The plumes apparently originate at
great depths, perhaps as deep as the boundary
between the core and the mantle, and many have
been active for a very long time. The oldest
volcanoes in the Hawaii hot-spot trail have ages
close to 80 million years. Other islands, including
Tahiti and Easter Islands in the Pacific, Reunion
and Mauritius in the India Ocean, and indeed most
of the large islands in the world's oceans, owe their
existence to mantle plumes.
The oceanic volcanic islands and their hot-spot
trails are thus especially useful for geologist
because they record the past locations of the plate
over a fixed source. They therefore permit the
reconstruction of the process of seafloor spreading,
and consequently of the geography of continents
and of ocean basins in the past. For example,
given the current position of the Pacific Plate,
Hawaii is above the Pacific Ocean hot spot. So the
position of The Pacific Plate 50 million years ago
can be determined by moving it such that a 50-
million-year-old volcano in the hot-spot trail sits at
the location of Hawaii today. However because the
ocean basins really are short-lived features on
geologic times scale, reconstruction of the world's
geography by backtracking along the hot-spot trail
works only for the last 5 percent or so of geologic
time.

28 – 1 Groundwater
Most of the world’s potable water — freshwater
suitable for drinking — is accounted for by
groundwater, which is stored in the pores and
fractures in rocks. There is more than 50 times as
much freshwater stored underground than in all the
freshwater rivers and lakes at the surface. Nearly
50 percent of all groundwater is stored in the upper
1,000 meters of Earth. At greater depths within
Earth, the pressure of the overlying rock causes
pores and cracks to close, reducing the space that
pore water can occupy, and almost complete
closure occurs at a depth of about 10 kilometers.
The greatest water storage, therefore, lies near the
surface.
Aquifers, Porosity and Permeability
Groundwater is stored in a variety of rock types. A
groundwater reservoir from which water can be
extracted is called an aquifer. We can effectively
think of an aquifer as a deposit of water. Extraction
of water depends on two properties of the aquifer:
porosity and permeability. Between sediment
grains are spaces that can be filled with water. This
pore space is known as porosity and is expressed
as a percentage of the total rock volume. Porosity
is important for water-storage capacity, but for
water to flow through rocks, the pore spaces must
be connected. The ability of water, or other fluids,
to flow through the interconnected pore spaces in
rocks is termed permeability. In the intergranular
spaces of rocks, however, fluid must flow around
and between grains in a tortuous path; this winding
path causes a resistance to flow. The rate at which
the flowing water overcomes this resistance is
related to the permeability of rock.
Sediment sorting and compaction influence
permeability and porosity. The more poorly sorted
or the more tightly compacted a sediment is,the
lower its porosity and permeability. Sedimentary
rocks — the most common rock type near the
surface — are also the most common reservoirs for
water because they contain the most space that
can be filled with water. Sandstones generally
make good aquifers, while finer-grained mudstones
are typically impermeable. Impermeable rocks are
referred to as aquicludes. Igneous and
metamorphic rocks are more compact, commonly
crystalline, and rarely contain spaces between
grains. However, even igneous and metamorphic
rocks may act as groundwater reservoirs if
extensive fracturing occurs in such rocks and if the
fracture system is interconnected.
The Water Table
The water table is the underground boundary
below which all the cracks and pores are filled with
water. In some cases, the water table reaches
Earth’s surface, where it is expressed as rivers,
lakes and marshes. Typically, though, the water
table may be tens or hundreds of meters below the
surface. The water table is not flat but usually
follows the contours of the topography. Above the
water table is the vadose zone, through which
rainwater percolates. Water in the vadose zone
drains down to the water table, leaving behind a
thin coating of water on mineral grains. The vadose
zone supplies plant roots near the surface with
water.
Because the surface of the water table is not flat
but instead rises and falls with topography,
groundwater is affected by gravity in the same
fashion as surface water. Groundwater flows
downhill to topographic lows. If the water table
intersects the land surface, groundwater will flow
out onto the surface at springs, either to be
collected there or to subsequently flow farther
along a drainage. Groundwater commonly collects
in stream drainages but may remain entirely
beneath the surface of dry stream-beds in arid
regions. In particularly wet years, short stretches of
an otherwise dry stream-bed may have flowing
water because the water table rises to intersect the
land surface.
41
31 – 1 Speciation in Geographically Isolated
Populations
Evolutionary biologists believe that speciation, the
formation of a new species, often begins when
some kind of physical barrier arises and divides a
population of a single species into separate
subpopulations. Physical separation between
subpopulations promotes the formation of new
species because once the members of one
subpopulation can no longer mate with members of
another subpopulation, they cannot exchange
variant genes that arise in one of the
subpopulations. In the absences of gene flow
between the subpopulations, genetic differences
between the groups begin to accumulate.
Eventually the subpopulations become so
genetically distinct that they cannot interbreed even
if the physical barriers between them were
removed. At this point the subpopulations have
evolved into distinct species. This route to
speciation is known as allopatry ("allo" means
"different", and "patria" means "homeland").
Allopatric speciation may be the main speciation
route. This should not be surprising, since allopatry
is pretty common. In general, the subpopulations of
most species are separated from each other by
some measurable distance. So even under normal
situations the gene flow among the subpopulations
is more of an intermittent trickle than a steady
stream. In addition, barriers can rapidly arise and
shut off the trickle. For example, in the 1800s a
monstrous earthquake changed the course of the
Mississippi River, a large river flowing in the central
part of the United States of America. The change
separated populations of insects now living along
opposite shore, completely cutting off gene flow
between them.
Geographic isolation also can proceed slowly, over
great spans of time. We find evidence of such
extended events in the fossil record, which affords
glimpses into the breakup of formerly continuous
environments. For example, during past ice ages,
glaciers advanced down through North America
and Europe and gradually cut off parts of
populations from one another. When the glacier
retreated, the separated populations of plants and
animals came into contact again. Some groups that
had descended from the same parent population
were no longer reproductively compatible - they
had evolved into separate species. In other groups,
however, genetic divergences had not proceeded
so far, and the descendants could still interbreed -
for them, reproductive isolation was not completed,
and so speciation had not occurred.
Allopatric speciation can also be brought by the
imperceptibly slow but colossal movements of the
tectonic plates that make up Earth's surface. About
5 million years ago such geologic movements
created the land bridge between North America
and South America that we call the Isthmus of
Panama. While previously the gap between the
continents had allowed a free flow of water, now
the isthmus presented a barrier that divided the
Atlantic Ocean from the Pacific Ocean. This
division set the stage for allopatric speciation
among populations of fishes and other marine
species.
In the 1980s, John Graves studied two populations
of closely related fishes, one population from the
Atlantic side of isthmus, the other from the Pacific
side. He compared four enzymes found in the
muscles of each population. Graves found that all
four Pacific enzymes function better at lower
temperatures than the four Atlantic versions of the
same enzymes. This is significant because Pacific
seawater is typically 2 to 3 degrees cooler than
seawater on the Atlantic side of isthmus. Analysis
by gel electrophoresis revealed slight differences in
amino acid sequence of the enzymes of two of the
four pairs. This is significant because the amino
acid sequence of an enzyme is determined by
genes.
Graves drew two conclusions from these
observations. First, at least some of the observed
differences between the enzymes of the Atlantic
and Pacific fish populations were not random but
were the result of evolutionary adaption. Second, it
appears that closely related populations of fishes
on both sides of the isthmus are starting to
genetically diverge from each other. Because
Graves's study of geographically isolated
populations of isthmus fishes offers a glimpse of
the beginning of a process of gradual accumulation
of mutations that are neutral or adaptive,
divergences here might be evidence of allopatric
speciation in process.

35 – 1 Earth's Age
One of the first recorded observers to surmise a
long age for Earth was the Greek historian
Herodotus, who lived from approximately 480 B.C.
to 425 B.C. He observed that the Nile River Delta
was in fact a series of sediment deposits built up in
successive floods. By noting that individual floods
deposit only thin layers of sediment, he was able to
conclude that the Nile Delta had taken many
thousands of years to build up. More important
than the amount of time Herodotus computed,
which turns out to be trivial compared with the age
of Earth, was the notion that one could estimate
ages of geologic features by determining rates of
the processes responsible for such features, and
then assuming the rates to be roughly constant
over time. Similar applications of this concept were
to be used again and again in later centuries to
estimate the ages of rock formations and, in
particular, of layers of sediment that had
compacted and cemented to form sedimentary
rocks.
It was not until the seventeenth century that
attempts were made again to understand clues to
Earth's history through the rock record. Nicolaus
Steno (1638-1686) was the first to work out
principles of the progressive depositing of sediment
in Tuscany. However, James Hutton (1726-1797),
known as the founder of modern geology, was the
first to have the important insight that geologic
processes are cyclic in nature. Forces associated
with subterranean heat cause land to be uplifted
into plateaus and mountain ranges. The effects of
wind and water then break down the masses of
uplifted rock, producing sediment that is
transported by water downward to ultimately form
layers in lakes, seashores, or even oceans. Over
time, the layers become sedimentary rock. These
rocks are then uplifted sometime in the future to
form new mountain ranges, which exhibit the
sedimentary layers (and the remains of life within
those layers) of the earlier episodes of erosion and
deposition.
Hutton's concept represented a remarkable insight
because it unified many individual phenomena and
observations into a conceptual picture of Earth’s
history. With the further assumption that these
geologic processes were generally no more or less
vigorous than they are today, Hutton's examination
of sedimentary layers led him to realize that Earth's
history must be enormous, that geologic time is an
abyss and human history a speck by comparison.
After Hutton, geologists tried to determine rates of
sedimentation so as to estimate the age of Earth
from the total length of the sedimentary or
stratigraphic record. Typical numbers produced at
the turn of the twentieth century were 100 million to
400 million years. These underestimated the actual
age by factors of 10 to 50 because much of the
sedimentary record is missing in various locations
and because there is a long rock sequence that is
older than half a billion years that is far less well
defined in terms of fossils and less well preserved.
Various other techniques to estimate Earth's age
fell short, and particularly noteworthy in this regard
were flawed determinations of the Sun's age. It had
been recognized by the German philosopher
Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) that chemical
reactions could not supply the tremendous amount
of energy flowing from the Sun for more than about
a millennium. Two physicists during the nineteenth
century both came up with ages for the Sun based
on the Sun's energy coming from gravitational
contraction. Under the force of gravity, the
compression resulting from a collapse of the object
must release energy. Ages for Earth were derived
that were in the tens of millions of years, much less
than the geologic estimates of the time.
It was the discovery of radioactivity at the end of
the nineteenth century that opened the door to
determining both the Sun’s energy source and the
age of Earth. From the initial work came a suite of
discoveries leading to radio isotopic dating, which
quickly ted to the realization that Earth must be
billions of years old, and to the discovery of nuclear
fusion as an energy source capable of sustaining
the Sun's luminosity for that amount of time. By the
1960s, both analysis of meteorites and refinements
of solar evolution models converged on an age for
the solar system, and hence for Earth, of 4.5 billion
years.
43
36 – 1 Soil Formation
Living organisms play an essential role in soil
formation. The numerous plants and animals living
in the soil release minerals from the parent material
from which soil is formed, supply organic matter,
aid in the translocation (movement) and aeration of
the soil, and help protect the soil from erosion. The
types of organisms growing or living in the soil
greatly influence the soil's physical and chemical
characteristics. In fact, for mature soils in many
parts of the world, the predominant type of natural
vegetation is considered the most important direct
influence on soil characteristics. For this reason, a
soil scientist can tell a great deal about the
attributes of the soil in any given area simply from
knowing what kind of flora the soil supports. Thus
prairies and tundra regions, which have
characteristic vegetations, also have characteristic
soils.
The quantity and total weight of soil flora generally
exceed that of soil fauna. By far the most
numerous and smallest of the plants living in soil
are bacteria. Under favorable conditions, a million
or more of these tiny, single-celled plants can
inhabit each cubic centimeter of soil. It is the
bacteria, more than any other organisms, that
enable rock or other parent material to undergo the
gradual transformation to soil. Some bacteria
produce organic acids that directly attack parent
material, breaking it down and releasing plant
nutrients. Others decompose organic litter (debris)
to form humus (nutrient-rich organic matter). A third
group of bacteria inhabits the root systems of
plants called legumes. These include many
important agricultural crops, such as alfalfa, clover,
soybeans, peas, and peanuts. The bacteria that
legumes host within their root nodules (small
swellings on the root) change nitrogen gas from the
atmosphere into nitrogen compounds that plants
are able to metabolize, a process, known as
nitrogen fixation, that makes the soil more fertile.
Other microscopic plants also are important in soil
development. For example, in highly acidic soils
where few bacteria can survive, fungi frequently
become the chief decomposers of organic matter.
More complex forms of vegetation play several vital
roles with respect to the soil. Tress, grass, and
other large plants supply the bulk of the soil's
humus. The minerals released as these plants
decompose on the surface constitute an important
nutrient source for succeeding generations of
plants as well as for other soil organisms. In
addition, trees can extend their roots deep within
the soil and bring up nutrients from far below the
surface. These nutrients eventually enrich the
surface soil when the tree drops its leaves or when
it dies and decomposes. Finally, trees perform the
vital function of slowing water runoff and holding
the soil in place with their root systems, thus
combating erosion. The increased erosion that
often accompanies agricultural use of sloping land
is principally caused by the removal of its protective
cover of natural vegetation.
Animals also influence soil composition. The faunal
counterparts of bacteria are protozoa. These
single-celled organisms are the most numerous
representatives of the animal kingdom, and, like
bacteria, a million or more can sometimes inhabit
each cubic centimeter of soil. Protozoa feed on
organic matter and hasten its decomposition.
Among other soil-dwelling animals, the earthworm
is probably the most important. Under exceptionally
favorable conditions, up to a million earthworms
(with a total body weight exceeding 450 kilograms)
may inhabit an acre of soil. Earthworms ingest
large quantities of soil, chemically alter it, and
excrete it as organic matter called casts. The casts
form a high-quality natural fertilizer. In addition,
earthworms mix of soil both vertically and
horizontally, improving aeration and drainage.
Insects such as ants and termites also can be
exceedingly numerous under favorable climatic and
soil conditions. In addition, mammals such as
moles, field mice, gophers, and prairie dogs
sometimes are present in sufficient numbers to
have significant impact on the soil. These animals
primarily work the soil mechanically. As a result,
the soil is aerated broken up, fertilized, and brought
to the surface, hastening soil development.

36 – 2 Early Ideas About Deep-sea Biology
In 1841 Edward Forbes was offered the chance to
serve as naturalist aboard HMS Beacon, an
English Royal Navy ship assigned to survey the
Aegean Sea. For a year and a half, the Beacon
crisscrossed the Aegean waters. During that time
Forbes was able to drag this small, triangular
dredge—a tool with a leather net for capturing
creatures along the sea bottom—at a hundred
locations, at depths ranging from 6 to 1380 feet. He
collected hundreds of different species of animals,
and he saw that they were distributed in eight
different depth zones, each containing its own
distinct assemblage of animal life, the way zones of
elevation on the side of a mountain are populated
by distinct sets of plants.
Forbes also thought he saw, as he later told the
British Association, that "the number of species and
individuals diminishes as we descend, pointing to a
zero in the distribution of animal life as yet
unvisited." This zero, Forbes casually speculated—
he simply extended a line on his graph of animal
number versus depth—probably began at a depth
of 1,800 feet. Below that was the final zone in
Forbes's scheme, zone nine, a zone that covered
most of the ocean floor and thus most of the solid
surface of Earth: Forbes called this the azoic zone,
where no animal, to say nothing of plants, could
survive.
Forbes's azoic zone was entirely plausible at the
time, and it was certainly far from the strangest
idea that was then entertained about the deep sea.
In the first decade of the nineteenth century, a
French naturalist named Francois Peron had sailed
around the world measuring the temperature of the
ocean. He found that the deeper the water, the
colder it got, and he concluded that the seafloor
was covered with a thick layer of ice. Peron ignored
the fact that water expands when it freezes and
that ice therefore floats. A more popular belief at
the time was that water at great depth would be
compressed to such a density that nothing could
sink through it. This ignored the fact that water is all
but incompressible. But even the more sensible
naturalists of the day were guilty of a similar
misconception. They imagined the deep sea as
being filled with an unmoving and undisturbable
pool of cold, dense water. In reality the deep is
always being refreshed by cold water sinking from
above.
The central implication of all these misconceptions
was that nothing could live in the abyss (deep), just
as Forbes's observations seemed to indicate. But
Forbes erred in two ways. One was the particular
study site he happened to use as a springboard for
his sweeping postulate of a lifeless abyss. Although
the Aegean had been the birthplace of marine
biology, its depths are now known to be
exceptionally lacking in animal diversity. Moreover,
through no fault of his own, Forbes was not
particularly successful at sampling such life as did
exist at the bottom of the Aegean. It was his dredge
that was inadequate. Its opening was so small and
the holes in the net so large that the dredge
inevitably missed animals. Many of those it did
catch must have poured out of its open mouth
when Forbes reeled it in. His azoic zone, then, was
a plausible but wild extrapolation from pioneering
but feeble data.
As it turned out, the existence of the azoic zone
had been disproved even before Forbes suggested
it, and the theory continued to be contradicted
regularly throughout its long and influential life.
Searching for the Northwest Passage from the
Atlantic to the Pacific in 1818, Sir John Ross had
lowered his "deep-sea clam"—a sort of bivalved
sediment scoop-into the water of Baffin Bay (an
inlet between the Atlantic and Arctic oceans), which
he determined to be more than a thousand fathoms
deep in some places. Modern soundings indicate
he overestimated his depths by several hundred
fathoms, but in any case Ross's clam dove several
times deeper than Forbes's dredge. It brought back
mud laced with worms, and starfish that had
entangled themselves in the line at depths well
below the supposed boundary of the azoic zone.

40 – 4 Population and Climate
The human population on Earth has grown to the
point that it is having an effect on Earth's atmosphere
and ecosystems. Burning of fossil fuels, deforestation,
urbanization, cultivation of rice and cattle, and the
manufacture of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) for
propellants and refrigerants are increasing the
concentration of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen
oxides, sulphur oxides, dust, and CFCs in the
atmosphere. About 70 percent of the Sun's energy
passes through the atmosphere and strikes Earth's
surface. This radiation heats the surface of the land
and ocean, and these surfaces then reradiate infrared
radiation back into space. This allows Earth to avoid
heating up too much. However, not all of the infrared
radiation makes it into space; some is absorbed by
gases in the atmosphere and is reradiated back to
Earth's surface. A greenhouse gas is one that
absorbs infrared radiation and then reradiates some
of this radiation back to Earth. Carbon dioxide, CFCs,
methane, and nitrogen oxides are greenhouse gases.
The natural greenhouse effect of our atmosphere is
well established. In fact, without greenhouse gases in
the atmosphere, scientists calculate that Earth would
be about 33°C cooler than it currently is.
The current concentration of carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere is about 360 parts per million. Human
activities are having a major influence on atmospheric
carbon dioxide oncentrations, which are rising so fast
that current predictions are that atmospheric
concentrations of carbon dioxide will double in the
next 50 to 100 years. The Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) report in 1992, which
represents a consensus of most atmospheric
scientists, predicts that a doubling of carbon dioxide
concentration would raise global temperatures
anywhere between 1.4°C and 4.5°C. The IPCC report
issued in 2001 raised the temperature prediction
almost twofold. The suggested rise in temperature is
greater than the changes that occurred in the past
between ice ages. The increase in temperatures
would not be uniform, with the smallest changes at
the equator and changes two or three times as great
at the poles. The local effects of these global changes
are difficult to predict, but it is generally agreed that
they may include alterations in ocean currents,
increased winter flooding in some areas of the
Northern Hemisphere, a higher incidence of summer
drought in some areas, and rising sea levels, which
may flood low-lying countries.
Scientists are actively investigating the feedback
mechanism within the physical, chemical, and
biological components of Earth's climate system in
order to make accurate predictions of the effects the
rise in greenhouse gases will have on future global
climates. Global circulation models are important
tools in this process. These models incorporate
current knowledge on atmospheric circulation
patterns, ocean currents, the effect of landmasses,
and the like to predict climate under changed
conditions. There are several models, and all show
agreement on a global scale. For example, all models
show substantial changes in climate when carbon
dioxide concentration is doubled. However, there are
significant differences in the regional climates
predicted by different models. Most models project
greater temperature increases in mid-latitude regions
and in mid-continental regions relative to the global
average. Additionally, changes in precipitation
patterns are predicted, with decreases in mid-latitude
regions and increased rainfall in some tropical areas.
Finally, most models predict that there will be
increased occurrences of extreme events, such as
extended periods without rain (drought), extreme heat
waves, greater seasonal variation in temperatures,
and increases in the frequency and magnitude of
severe storms. Plants and animals have strong
responses to virtually every aspect of these projected
global changes.
The challenge of predicting organismal responses to
global climate change is difficult. Partly, this is due to
the fact that there are more studies of short-term,
individual organism responses than there are of longterm, systemwide studies. It is extremely difficult, both
monetarily and physically, for scientists to conduct
field studies at spatial and temporal scales that are
large enough to include all the components of realworld systems, especially ecosystems with large,
freely ranging organisms. One way paleobiologists try
to get around this limitation is to attempt to
reconstruct past climates by examining fossil life.
The relative roles that abiotic and biotic factors play in
the distribution of organisms is especially important
now, when the world is confronted with the
consequences of a growing human population.
Changes in climate, land use, and habitat destruction
are currently causing dramatic decreases in
biodiversity throughout the world. An understanding of
climate-organism relationships is essential to efforts
to preserve and manage Earth's biodiversity.
46
40 – 2 Latitude and Biodiversity
When we look at the way in which biodiversity
(biological diversity) is distributed over the land
surface of the planet, we find that it is far from
even. The tropics contain many more species
overall than an equivalent area at the higher
latitudes. This seems to be true for many different
groups of animals and plants.
Why is it that higher latitudes have lower diversities
than the tropics? Perhaps it is simply a matter of
land area. The tropics contain a larger surface area
of land than higher latitudes—a fact that is not
always evident when we examine commonly used
projections of Earth’s curved surface, since this
tends to exaggerate the areas of land in the higher
latitudes—and some biogeographers regard the
differences in diversity as a reflection of this effect.
But an analysis of the data by biologist Klaus
Rohde does not support this explanation. Although
area may contribute to biodiversity, it is certainly
not the whole story; otherwise, large landmasses
would always be richer in species.
Productivity seems to be involved instead, though
perhaps its influence is indirect. Where conditions
are most suitable for plant growth—that is, where
temperatures are relatively high and uniform and
where there is an ample supply of water—one
usually finds large masses of vegetation. This leads
to a complex structure in the layers of plant
material In a tropical rain forest, for example, a very
large quantity of plant material builds up above the
surface of the ground .There is also a large mass of
material, developed below ground as root tissues,
but this is less apparent. Careful analysis of the
above ground material reveals that it is arranged in
a series of layers, the precise number of layers
varying with age and the nature of the forest. The
arrangement of the biological mass ("biomass") of
the vegetation into layered forms is termed its
“structure” (as opposed to its “composition,” which
refers to the species of organisms forming the
community) Structure is essentially the architecture
of vegetation, and as in the case of tropical forests,
it can be extremely complicated. In a mature
floodplain tropical forest in the Amazon River basin,
the canopy (the uppermost layers of a forest,
formed by the crowns of trees) takes on a stratified
structure. There are three clear peaks in leaf cover
at heights of approximately 3, 6, and 30 meters
above the ground; and the very highest layer, at 50
meters, corresponds to the very tall trees that stand
free of the main canopy and form an open layer of
their own. So, such a forest contains essentially
four layers of canopy. Forests in temperate lands
often have just two canopy layers, so they have
much less complex architecture.
Structure has a strong influence on the animal life
inhabiting a site. It forms the spatial environment
within which an animal feeds, moves around
shelters, lives, and breeds. It even affects the
climate on a very local level (the "microclimate") by
influencing light intensity, humidity, and both the
range and extremes of temperature. An area of
grassland vegetation with very simple structure, for
example, has a very different microclimate at the
ground level from that experienced in the upper
canopy. Wind speeds are lower, temperatures are
lower during the day (but warmer at night), and the
relative humidity is much greater near the ground.
The complexity of the microclimate is closely
related to the complexity of structure in vegetation,
and generally speaking, the more complex the
structure of vegetation, the more species of animal
are able to make a living there. The high plant
biomass of the tropics leads to a greater spatial
complexity in the environment, and this leads to a
higher potential for diversity in the living things that
can occupy a region. The climates of the higher
latitudes are generally less favorable for the
accumulation of large quantities of biomass; hence,
the structure of vegetation is simpler and the
animal diversity is consequently lower.

43 – 3 El Niño
The cold Humboldt Current of the Pacific Ocean
flows toward the equator along the coasts of
Ecuador and Peru in South America. When the
current approaches the equator, the westwardflowing trade winds cause nutrient-rich cold water
along the coast to rise from deeper depths to more
shallow ones. This upwelling of water has
economic repercussions. Fishing, especially for
anchovies, is a major local industry.
Every year during the months of December and
January, a weak, warm countercurrent replaces the
normally cold coastal waters. Without the upwelling
of nutrients from below to feed the fish, fishing
comes to a standstill. Fishers in this region have
known the phenomenon for hundreds of years. In
fact, this is the time of year they traditionally set
aside to tend to their equipment and await the
return of cold water. The residents of the region
have given this phenomenon the name of El Niño,
which is Spanish for "the child," because it occurs
at about the time of the celebration of birth of the
Christ child.
While the warm-water countercurrent usually lasts
for two months or less, there are occasions when
the disruption to the normal flow lasts for many
months. In these situations, water temperatures are
raised not just along the coast, but for thousands of
kilometers offshore. Over the last few decades, the
term El Nifio has come to be used to describe
these exceptionally strong episodes and not the
annual event. During the past 60 years, at least ten
El Niño have been observed Not only do El Niño
affect the temperature of the equatorial Pacific, but
the strongest of them impact global weather.
The processes that interact to produce an El Niño
involve conditions all across the Pacific, not just in
the waters off South America. Over 60 years ago,
Sir Gilbert Walker, a British scientist, discovered a
connection between surface pressure readings at
weather stations on the eastern and western sides
of the Pacific. He noted that a rise in atmospheric
pressure in the eastern Pacific is usually
accompanied by a fall in pressure in the western
Pacific and vice versa. He called this seesaw
pattern the Southern Oscillation. It was later
realized that there is a close link between El Niño
and the Southern Oscillation. In fact, the link
between the two is so great that they are often
referred to jointly as ENSO (El Niño-Southern
Oscillation).
During a typical year, the eastern Pacific has a
higher pressure than the western Pacific does. This
east-to-west pressure gradient enhances the trade
winds over the equatorial waters. This results in a
warm surface current that moves east to west at
the equator. The western Pacific develops a thick,
warm layer of water while the eastern Pacific has
the cold Humboldt Current enhanced by upwelling.
However, in other years the Southern Oscillation,
for unknown reasons, swings in the opposite
direction, dramatically changing the usual
conditions described above, with pressure
increasing in the western. Pacific and decreasing in
the eastern Pacific. This change in the pressure
gradient causes the trade winds to weaken or, in
some cases, to reverse. This then causes the warm
water in the western Pacific to flow eastward,
increasing sea-surface temperatures in the central
and eastern Pacific. The eastward shift signals the
beginning of an El Nino.
Scientists try to document as many past El Niño
events as possible by piecing together bits of
historical evidence, such as sea-surface
temperature records, daily observations of
atmospheric pressure and rainfall, fisheries’
records from South America, and the writings of
Spanish colonists dating back to the fifteenth
century. From such historical evidence we know
that El Niño have occurred as far back as records
go. It would seem that they are becoming more
frequent. Records indicate that during the sixteenth
century, an El Niño occurred on average every six
years. Evidence gathered over the past few
decades indicates that El Niños are now occurring
on average a little over every two years. Even more
alarming is the fact that they appear to be getting
stronger. The 1997-1998 El Niño brought copious
and damaging rainfall to the southern United
States, from California to Florida. Snowstorms in
the northeast portion of the United States were
more frequent and intense than in most years.

46 – 3 Ecosystem Diversity and Stability
Conservation biologists have long been concerned
that species extinction could have significant
consequences for the stability of entire
ecosystems—groups of interacting organisms and
the physical environment that they inhabit. An
ecosystem could survive the loss of some species,
but if enough species were lost, the ecosystem
would be severely degraded. In fact, it is possible
that the loss of a single important species could
start a cascade of extinctions that might
dramatically change an entire ecosystem. A good
illustration of this occurred after sea otters were
eliminated from some Pacific kelp (seaweed) bed
ecosystems: the kelp beds were practically
obliterated too because in the absence of sea otter
predation, sea urchin populations exploded and
consumed most of the kelp and other macroalgae.
It is usually claimed that species-rich ecosystems
tend to be more stable than species-poor
ecosystems. Three mechanisms by which higher
diversity increases ecosystem stability have been
proposed. First, if there are more species in an
ecosystem, then its food web will be more complex,
with greater redundancy among species in terms of
their nutritional roles. In other words, in a rich
system if a species is lost, there is a good chance
that other species will take over its function as prey,
predator, producer, decomposer, or whatever role it
played. Second, diverse ecosystems may be less
likely to be invaded by new species, notably exotics
(foreign species living outside their native range),
that would disrupt the ecosystem’s structure and
function. Third, in a species-rich ecosystem,
diseases may spread more slowly because most
species will be relatively less abundant, thus
increasing the average distance between
individuals of the same species and hampering
disease transmission among individuals.
Scientific evidence to illuminate these ideas has
been slow in coming, and many shadows remain.
One of the first studies to provide data supporting a
relationship between diversity and stability
examined how grassland plants responded to a
drought. Researchers D. Tilman and J A. Downing
used the ratio of above-ground biomass in 1988
(after two years of drought) to that in 1986
(predrought) in 207 plots in a grassland field in the
Cedar Creek Natural History Area in Minnesota as
an index of ecosystem response to disruption by
drought. In an experiment that began in 1982, they
compared these values with the number of plant
species in each plot and discovered that the plots
with a greater number of plant species experienced
a less dramatic reduction in biomass. Plots with
more than ten species had about half as much
biomass in 1988 as in 1986, whereas those with
fewer than five species only produced roughly oneeighth as much biomass after the two-year drought.
Apparently, species-rich plots were likely to contain
some drought-resistant plant species that grew
better in drought years, compensating for the poor
growth of less-tolerant species.
To put this result in more general terms, a speciesrich ecosystem may be more stable because it is
more likely to have species with a wide array of
responses to variable conditions such as droughts.
Furthermore, a species-rich ecosystem is more
likely to have species with similar ecological
functions, so that if a species is lost from an
ecosystem, another species, probably a competitor,
is likely to flourish and occupy its functional role.
Both of these, variability in responses and
functional redundancy, could be thought of as
insurance against disturbances.
The Minnesota grassland research has been
widely accepted as strong evidence for the
diversity- stability theory; however, its findings have
been questioned, and similar studies on other
ecosystems have not always found a positive
relationship between diversity and stability. Clearly,
this is a complex issue that requires further field
research with a broad spectrum of ecosystems and
species: grassland plants and computer models will
only take us so far. In the end, despite insightful
attempts to detect some general patterns, we may
find it very difficult to reduce this topic to a simple,
universal truth.
49
45 – 2 Wind pollination
Pollen, a powdery substance, which is produced by
flowering plants and contains male reproductive
cells, is usually carried from plant to plant by
insects or birds, but some plants rely on the wind to
carry their pollen. Wind pollination is often seen as
being primitive and wasteful in costly pollen and yet
it is surprisingly common, especially in higher
latitudes. Wind is very good at moving pollen a long
way; pollen can be blown for hundreds of
kilometers, and only birds can get pollen anywhere
near as far. The drawback is that wind is obviously
unspecific as to where it takes the pollen. It is like
trying to get a letter to a friend at the other end of
the village by climbing onto the roof and throwing
an armful of letters into the air and hoping that one
will end up in the friend's garden. For the relatively
few dominant tree species that make up temperate
forests, where there are many individuals of the
same species within pollen range, this is quite a
safe gamble. If a number of people in the village
were throwing letters off roofs, your friend would be
bound to get one. By contrast, in the tropics, where
each tree species has few, widely scattered
individuals, the chance of wind blowing pollen to
another individual is sufficiently slim that animals
are a safer bet as transporters of pollen. Even tall
trees in the tropics are usually not wind pollinated
despite being in windy conditions. In a similar way,
trees in temperate forests that are insect pollinated
tend to grow as solitary, widely spread individuals.
Since wind-pollinated flowers have no need to
attract insects or other animals, they have
dispensed with bright petals, nectar, and scent.
These are at best a waste and at worst an
impediment to the transfer of pollen in the air. The
result is insignificant-looking flowers and catkins
(dense cylindrical clusters of small, petalless
flowers).
Wind pollination does, of course, require a lot of
pollen. Birch and hazel trees can produce 5.5 and
4 million grains per catkin, respectively. There are
various adaptations to help as much of the pollen
go as far as possible. Most deciduous windpollinated trees (which shed their leaves every fall)
produce their pollen in the spring while the
branches are bare of leaves to reduce the
surrounding surfaces that “compete" with the
stigmas (the part of the flower that receives the
pollen) for pollen. Evergreen conifers, which do not
shed their leaves, have less to gain from spring
flowering, and, indeed, some flower in the autumn
or winter.
Pollen produced higher in the top branches is likely
to go farther: it is windier (and gustier) and the
pollen can be blown farther before hitting the
ground. Moreover, dangling catkins like hazel hold
the pollen in until the wind is strong enough to bend
them, ensuring that pollen is only shed into the air
when the wind is blowing hard. Weather is also
important. Pollen is shed primarily when the air is
dry to prevent too much sticking to wet surfaces or
being knocked out of the air by rain. Despite these
adaptations, much of the pollen fails to leave the
top branches, and only between 0.5 percent and 40
percent gets more than 100 meters away from the
parent. But once this far, significant quantities can
go a kilometer or more. Indeed, pollen can travel
many thousands of kilometers at high altitudes.
Since all this pollen is floating around in the air, it is
no wonder that wind-pollinated trees are a major
source of allergies.
Once the pollen has been snatched by the wind,
the fate of the pollen is obviously up to the vagaries
of the wind, but not everything is left to chance.
Windborne pollen is dry, rounded, smooth, and
generally smaller than that of insect-pollinated
plants. But size is a two-edged sword. Small grains
may be blown farther but they are also more prone
to be whisked past the waiting stigma because
smaller particles tend to stay trapped in the fastmoving air that flows around the stigma. But
stigmas create turbulence, which slows the air
speed around them and may help pollen stick to
them.
50
48 – 3 Climate and Urban Development
For more than a hundred years, it has been known
that cities are generally warmer than surrounding
rural areas. This region of city warmth, known as
the urban heat island, can influence the
concentration of air pollution. However, before we
look at its influence, let’s see how the heat island
actually forms.
The urban heat island is due to industrial and urban
development. In rural areas, a large part of the
incoming solar energy is used in evaporating water
from vegetation and soil. In cities, where less
vegetation and exposed soil exist, the majority of
the Sun’s energy is absorbed by urban structures
and asphalt. Hence, during warm daylight hours,
less evaporative cooling in cities allows surface
temperatures to rise higher than in rural areas. The
cause of the urban heat island is quite involved.
Depending on the location, time of year, and time
of day, any or all of the following differences
between cities and their surroundings can be
important: albedo (reflectivity of the surface),
surface roughness, emissions of heat, emissions of
moisture, and emissions of particles that affect net
radiation and the growth of cloud droplets.
At night, the solar energy (stored as vast quantities
of heat in city buildings and roads) is slowly
released into the city air. Additional city heat is
given off at night (and during the day) by vehicles
and factories, as well as by industrial and domestic
heating and cooling units. The release of heat
energy is retarded by the tall vertical city walls that
do not allow infrared radiation to escape as readily
as does the relatively level surface of the
surrounding countryside. The slow release of heat
tends to keep nighttime city temperatures higher
than those of the faster-cooling rural areas. Overall,
the heat island is strongest (1) at night when
compensating sunlight is absent; (2) during the
winter, when nights are longer and there is more
heat generated in the city; and (3) when the region
is dominated by a high-pressure area with light
winds, clear skies, and less humid air. Over time,
increasing urban heat islands affect climatological
temperature records, producing artificial warming in
climatic records taken in cities. This warming,
therefore, must be accounted for in interpreting
climate change over the past century.
The constant outpouring of pollutants into the
environment may influence the climate of the city.
Certain particles reflect solar radiation, thereby
reducing the sunlight that reaches the surface.
Some particles serve as nuclei upon which water
and ice form. Water vapor condenses onto these
particles when the relative humidity is as low as 70
percent, forming haze that greatly reduces visibility.
Moreover, the added nuclei increase the frequency
of city fog.
Studies suggest that precipitation may be greater in
cities than in the surrounding countryside; this
phenomenon may be due in part to the increased
roughness of city terrain, brought on by large
structures that cause surface air to slow and
gradually converge. This piling up of air over the
city then slowly rises, much like toothpaste does
when its tube is squeezed. At the same time, city
heat warms the surface air, making it more
unstable, which enhances risings air motions,
which, in turn, aids in forming clouds and
thunderstorms. This process helps explain why
both tend to be more frequent over cities.
On clear still nights when the heat island is
pronounced, a small thermal low-pressure area
forms over the city. Sometimes a light breeze—
called a country breeze—blows from the
countryside into the city. If there are major
industrial areas along the outskirts, pollutants are
carried into the heart of town, where they tend to
concentrate. Such an event is especially probable if
vertical mixing and dispersion of pollutants are
inhibited. Pollutants from urban areas may even
affect the weather downwind from them.
51
49 – 1 Ancient Coastlines
Information on past climates is of primary relevance
to archaeology because of what it tells us about the
effects on the land and on the resources that
people needed to survive. The most crucial effect
of climate was on the sheer quantity of land
available in each period, measurable by studying
ancient coastlines. These have changed constantly
through time, even in relatively recent periods, as
can be seen from the Neolithic stone circle of Er
Lannic, in Brittany, France (once inland but now
half submerged on an island) or medieval villages
in east Yorkshire, England, that have tumbled into
the sea in the last few centuries as the North Sea
gnaws its way westward and erodes the cliffs.
Conversely, silts deposited by rivers sometimes
push the sea farther back, creating new land, as at
Ephesus in western Turkey, a port on the coast in
Roman times but today some five kilometers
inland.
Nevertheless, for archeologists concerned with the
long periods of time of the Paleolithic period there
are variations in coastlines of much greater
magnitude to consider. The expansion and
contraction of the continental glaciers caused huge
and uneven rises and falls in sea levels worldwide.
When the ice sheets grew, the sea level would
drop as water became locked up in the glaciers;
when the ice melted, the sea level would rise
again. Falls in sea level often exposed a number of
important land bridges, such as those linking
Alaska to northeast Asia and Britain to northwest
Europe, a phenomenon with far-reaching effects
not only on human colonization of the globe but
also on the environment as a whole—the flora and
fauna of isolated or insular areas were radically
and often irreversibly affected. Between Alaska and
Asia today lies the Bering Strait, which is so
shallow that a fall in sea level of only four meters
would turn it into a land bridge. When the ice
sheets were at their greatest extent some 18,000
years ago (the glacier maximum), it is thought that
the fall was about 120 meters, which therefore
created not merely a bridge but a vast plain, 1,000
kilometers from the north to the south, which has
been called Beringia. The existence of Beringia
(and the extent to which it could have supported
human life) is one of the crucial pieces of evidence
in the continuing debate about the likely route and
date of human colonization of the New World.
The assessment of past rises and falls in sea level
requires study of submerged land surfaces off the
coast and of raised or elevated beaches on land.
Raised beaches are remnants of former coastlines
at higher levels relative to the present shoreline
and visible, for instance, along the Californian
coast north of San Francisco. The height of a
raised beach above the present shoreline,
however, does not generally give a straightforward
indication of the height of a former sea level. In the
majority of cases, the beaches lie at a higher level
because the land has been raised up through
isostatic uplift or tectonic movement. Isostatic uplift
of the land occurs when the weight of ice is
removed as temperatures rise, as at the end of an
ice age; it has affected coastlines, for example, in
Scandinavia, Scotland, Alaska, and Newfoundland
during the postglacial period. Tectonic movements
involve displacements in the plates that make up
Earth's crust. Middle and Late Pleistocene raised
beaches in the Mediterranean are one instance of
such movements.
Raised beaches often consist of areas of sand,
pebbles, or dunes, sometimes containing seashells
or piles of debris comprising shells and bones of
marine animals used by humans. In Tokyo Bay, for
example, shell mounds of the Jomon period (about
10,000 to 300 B.C.E.) mark the position of the
shoreline at a time of maximum inundation by the
sea (6,500-5,500 years ago),when, through
tectonic movement, the sea was three to five
meters higher in relation to the contemporary
landmass of Japan than at present. Analysis of the
shells themselves has confirmed the changes in
marine topography, for it is only during the
maximum phase that subtropical species of mollusc
are present, indicating a higher water temperature.
52
52 – 1 Stream Deposit
A large, swift stream or river can carry all sizes of
particles, from clay to boulders. When the current
slows down, its competence (how much it can
carry) decreases and the stream deposits the
largest particles in the streambed. If current velocity
continues to decrease—as a flood wanes, for
example—finer particles settle out on top of the
large ones. Thus, a stream sorts its sediment
according to size. A waning flood might deposit a
layer of gravel, overlain by sand and finally topped
by silt and clay. Streams also sort sediment in the
downstream direction. Many mountain streams are
choked with boulders and cobbles, but far
downstream, their deltas are composed mainly of
fine silt and clay. This downstream sorting is
curious because stream velocity generally
increases in the downstream direction.
Competence increases with velocity, so a river
should be able to transport larger particles than its
tributaries carry. One explanation for downstream
sorting is that abrasion wears away the boulders
and cobbles to sand and silt as the sediment
moves downstream over the years. Thus, only the
fine sediment reaches the lower parts of most
rivers.
A stream deposits its sediment in three
environments: Alluvial fans and deltas form where
stream gradient (angle of incline) suddenly
decreases as a stream enters a flat plain, a lake, or
the sea; floodplain deposits accumulate on a
floodplain adjacent to the stream channel; and
channel deposits form in the stream channel itself.
Bars, which are elongated mounds of sediment,
are transient features that form in the stream
channel and on the banks. They commonly form in
one year and erode the next. Rivers used for
commercial navigation must be recharged
frequently because bars shift from year to year.
Imagine a winding stream. The water on the
outside of the curve moves faster than the water on
the inside. The stream erodes its outside bank
because the current's inertia drives it into the
outside bank. At the same time, the slower water
on the inside point of the bend deposits sediment,
forming a point bar. A mid-channel bar is a sandy
and gravelly deposit that forms in the middle of a
stream channel.
Most streams flow in a single channel. In contrast,
a braided stream flows in many shallow,
interconnecting channels. A braided stream forms
where more sediment is supplied to a stream than
it can carry. The stream dumps the excess
sediment, forming mid-channel bars. The bars
gradually fill a channel, forcing the stream to
overflow its banks and erode new channels. As a
result, a braided stream flows simultaneously in
several channels and shifts back and forth across
its floodplain. Braided streams are common in both
deserts and glacial environments because both
produce abundant sediment. A desert yields large
amounts of sediment because it has little or no
vegetation to prevent erosion. Glaciers grind
bedrock into fine sediment, which is carried by
streams flowing from the melting ice. If a steep
mountain stream flows onto a flat plain, its gradient
and velocity decrease sharply. As a result, it
deposits most of its sediment in a fan-shaped
mound called an alluvial fan. Alluvial fans are
common in many arid and semiarid mountainous
regions.
A stream also slows abruptly where it enters the
still water of a lake or ocean. The sediment settles
out to form a nearly flat landform called a delta.
Part of the delta lies above water level, and the
remainder lies slightly below water level. Deltas are
commonly fan-shaped, resembling the Greek letter
"delta" (∆). Both deltas and alluvial fans change
rapidly. Sediment fills channels (waterways), which
are then abandoned while new channels develop
as in a braided stream. As a result, a stream
feeding a delta or fan splits into many channels
called distributaries. A large delta may spread out
in this manner until it covers thousands of square
kilometers. Most fans, however, are much smaller,
covering a fraction of a square kilometer to a few
square kilometers. The Mississippi River has
flowed through seven different delta channels
during the past 5,000 to 6,000 years. But in recent
years, engineers have built great systems of levees
(retaining walls) in attempts to stabilize the
channels.
53
54 – 3 Elements of Life
The creation of life requires a set of chemical
elements for making the components of cells. Life
on Earth uses about 25 of the 92 naturally
occurring chemical elements, although just 4 of
these elements—oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and
nitrogen—make up about 96 percent of the mass of
living organisms. Thus, a first requirement for life
might be the presence of most or all of the
elements used by life.
Interestingly, this requirement can probably be met
by almost any world. Scientists have determined
that all chemical elements in the universe besides
hydrogen and helium (and a trace amount of
lithium) were produced by stars. These are known
as heavy elements because they are heavier than
hydrogen and helium. Although all of these heavy
elements are quite rare compared to hydrogen and
helium, they are found just about everywhere.
Heavy elements are continually being
manufactured by stars and released into space by
stellar deaths, so their amount compared to
hydrogen and helium gradually rises with time.
Heavy elements make up about 2 percent of the
chemical content (by mass) of our solar system, the
other 98 percent is hydrogen and helium. In some
very old star systems, which formed before many
heavy elements were produced, the heavy-element
share may be less than 0.1 percent. Nevertheless,
every star system studied has at least some
amount of all the elements used by life. Moreover,
when planetesimals—small, solid objects formed in
the early solar system that may accumulate to
become planets—condense within a forming star
system, they are inevitably made from heavy
elements because the more common hydrogen
and helium remain gaseous. Thus, planetesimals
everywhere should contain the elements needed
for life, which means that objects built from
planetesimals—planets moons, asteroids, and
comets—also contain these elements. The nature
of solar-system formation explains why Earth
contains all the elements needed for life, and it is
why we expect these elements to be present on
other worlds throughout our solar system, galaxy,
and universe.
Note that this argument does not change, even if
we allow for life very different from life on Earth.
Life on Earth is carbon based, and most biologists
believe that life elsewhere is likely to be carbon
based as well. However, we cannot absolutely rule
out the possibility of life with another chemical
basis, such as silicon or nitrogen. The set of
elements (or their relative proportions) used by life
based on some other element might be somewhat
different from that used by carbon-based life on
Earth. But the elements are still products of stars
and would still be present in planetesimals
everywhere. No matter what kinds of life we are
looking for, we are likely to find the necessary
elements on almost every planet, moon, asteroid,
and comet in the universe.
A somewhat stricter requirement is the presence of
these elements in molecules that can be used as
ready-made building blocks for life, just as early
Earth probably had an organic soup of amino acids
and other complex molecules. Earth's organic
molecules likely came from some combination of
three sources: chemical reactions in the
atmosphere, chemical reactions near deep-sea
vents in the oceans, and molecules carried to Earth
by asteroids and comets. The first two sources can
occur only on worlds with atmospheres or oceans,
respectively. But the third source should have
brought similar molecules to nearly all worlds in our
solar system.
Studies of meteorites and comets suggest that
organic molecules are widespread among both
asteroids and comets. Because each body in the
solar system was repeatedly struck by asteroids
and comets during the period known as the heavy
bombardment (about 4 billion years ago), each
body should have received at least some organic
molecules. However, these molecules tend to be
destroyed by solar radiation on surfaces
unprotected by atmospheres. Moreover, while
these molecules might stay intact beneath the
surface (as they evidently do on asteroids and
comets), they probably cannot react with each
other unless some kind of liquid or gas is available
to move them about. Thus, if we limit our search to
worlds on which organic molecules are likely to be
involved in chemical reactions, we can probably
rule out any world that lacks both an atmosphere
and a surface or subsurface liquid medium, such as
water.

55 – 1 Mesolithic Complexity in Scandinavia
The European Mesolithic (roughly the period from
8000 B.C. to 2700 B.C.) testifies to a continuity in
human culture from the times of the Ice Age. This
continuity, however was based on continuous
adjustment to environmental changes following the
end of the last glacial period (about 12,500 years
ago). Three broad subdivisions within the northern
Mesolithic are known in Scandinavia. The
Maglemose Period (7500 -5700 B.C) was a time of
seasonal exploitation of rivers and lakes, combined
with terrestrial hunting and foraging. The sites from
the Kongemose Period (5700-4600 B.C.) are
mainly on the Baltic Sea coasts, along bays and
near lagoons, where the people exploited both
marine and terrestrial resources. Many Kongemose
sites are somewhat larger than Maglemose ones.
The Ertebolle Period (4600-3200 B.C.) was the
culmination of Mesolithic culture in southern
Scandinavia.
By the Ertebolle Period, the Scandinavians were
occupying coastal settlements year-round and
subsisting off a very wide range of food sources.
These included forest game and waterfowl,
shellfish, sea mammals, and both shallow-water
and deepwater fish. There were smaller seasonal
coastal sites, too: for specific activities such as
deepwater fishing, sealing, or hunting of migratory
birds. One such site, the Aggersund site in
Denmark, was occupied for short periods of time in
the autumn, when the inhabitants collected oysters
and hunted some game, especially migratory
swans. Ertebolle technology was far more
elaborate than that of its Mesolithic predecessors;
a wide variety of antler, bone: and wood tools for
specialized purposes such as fowling and seamammal hunting were developed, including dugout
canoes up to ten meters long.
With sedentary settlement comes evidence of
greater social complexity in the use of cemeteries
for burials and changes in burial practices. The
trend toward more sedentary settlement the
cemeteries, and the occasional social
differentiation revealed by elaborate burials are all
reflections of an intensified use of resources
among these relatively affluent hunter-gatherers of
3000 B.C. Mesolithic societies intensified the food
quest by exploiting many more marine species,
making productive use of migratory waterfowl and
their breeding grounds, and collecting shellfish in
enormous numbers. This intensification is also
reflected in a much more elaborate and diverse
technology, more exchange of goods and materials
between neighbors， greater variety in settlement
types, and a slowly rising population throughout
southern Scandinavia. These phenomena may, in
part; be a reflection of rising sea levels throughout
the Mesolithic that flooded many cherished
territories. There are signs, too, of regional
variations in artifact forms and styles, indicative of
cultural differences between people living in welldelineated territories and competing for resources.
Mesolithic cultures are much less well-defined
elsewhere in Europe, partly because the climatic
changes were less extreme than in southern
Scandinavia and because there were fewer
opportunities for coastal adaptation. In much of
central Europe, settlement was confined to
lakeside and riverside locations, widely separated
from one another by dense forests. Many
Mesolithic lakeside sites were located in transitional
zones between different environments so that the
inhabitants could return to a central base location,
where for much of the year they lived close to
predictable resources such as lake fish. However,
they would exploit both forest game and other
seasonal resources from satellite camps. For
example, the archaeologist Michael Jochim
believes that some groups lived during most of the
year in camps along the Danube River in central
Europe, moving to summer encampments on the
shores of neighboring lakes. In areas like Spain,
there appears to have been intensified exploitation
of marine and forest resources. There was a trend
nearly everywhere toward greater variety in the
diet, with more attention being paid to less obvious
foods and to those that require more complex
processing methods than do game and other such
resources.
Thus, in parts of Europe, there was a long-term
trend among hunter-gatherer societies toward a
more extensive exploitation of food resources,
often within the context of a strategy that sought
ways to minimize the impact of environmental
uncertainty. In more favored southern Scandinavia,
such societies achieved a new level of social
complexity that was to become commonplace
among later farming peoples, and this
preadaptation proved an important catalyst for
rapid economic and social change when farming
did come to Europe.

56 – 3 Urban Heat Islands
Climatic changes such as changes in temperature,
precipitation, humidity, or wind speed that are
produced by urbanization involve all major surface
conditions. Some of these changes are quite
obvious and relatively easy to measure. Others are
more subtle and sometimes difficult to measure.
The amount of change in any of these elements, at
any time, depends on several variables, including
the extent of the urban complex, the nature of
industry, site factors such as topography and
proximity to water bodies, time of day, and existing
weather conditions.
The most studied and well-documented urban
climatic effect is the urban heat island. The term
simply refers to the fact that temperatures within
cities are generally higher than in rural areas. The
heat island is evident when temperature data are
examined. For example, the distribution of average
minimum temperatures in the Washington, D C.,
metropolitan area for the three-month winter period
(December through February) over a five-year
span, clearly represents a well-developed heat
island. The warmest winter temperatures occurred
in the heart of the city, while the suburbs and
surrounding countryside experienced average
minimum temperatures that were as much as 3 3°C
lower. Remember that these temperatures are
averages, because on many clear, calm nights the
temperature difference between the city center and
the countryside was considerably greater, often
11°C or more. Conversely, on many overcast or
windy nights the temperature differential
approached zero degrees.
The radical change in the surface that results when
rural areas are transformed into cities is a
significant cause of the urban heat island. First, the
tall buildings and the concrete and asphalt of the
city absorb and store greater quantities of solar
radiation than do the vegetation and soil typical of
rural areas. In addition, because the city surface is
impermeable, the runoff of water following a rain is
rapid, resulting in a severe reduction in the
evaporation rate. Hence, heat that once would
have been used to convert liquid water to a gas
now goes to increase the surface temperature. At
night, while both the city and the countryside cool
by radiative losses, the stone-like surface of the city
gradually releases the additional heat accumulated
during the day, keeping the urban air warmer than
that of the outlying areas.
A portion of the urban temperature rise must also
be attributed to waste heat from sources such as
home heating and air conditioning, power
generation, industry, and transportation. Many
studies have shown that the magnitude of humangenerated energy in metropolitan areas is great
when compared to the amount of energy received
from the Sun at the surface. For example,
investigations in Sheffield, England, and Berlin,
Germany, showed that the annual heat production
in those cities was equal to approximately one-third
of that received from solar radiation. Another study
of densely built-up Manhattan in New York City
revealed that during the winter, the quantity of heat
produced by combustion alone was 2 times greater
than the amount of solar energy reaching the
ground. In summer, the figure dropped to 1/6.
There are other, somewhat less influential, causes
of the heat island. For example, the blanket of
pollutants over a city contributes to the heat island
by absorbing a portion of the upward-directed longwave radiation emitted at the surface and reemitting some of it back to the ground. A somewhat
similar effect results from the complex threedimensional structure of the city. The vertical walls
of office buildings, stores, and apartments do not
allow radiation to escape as readily as in outlying
rural areas where surfaces are relatively flat. As the
sides of these structures emit their stored heat, a
portion is re-radiated between buildings rather than
upward, and is therefore slowly dissipated. In
addition to re-radiating the heat loss from the city,
tall buildings also alter the flow of air. Because of
the greater surface roughness, wind speeds within
an urban area are reduced. Estimates from
available records suggest a decrease on the order
of about 25 percent from rural values. The lower
wind speeds decrease the city’s ventilation by
inhibiting the movement of cooler outside air which,
if allowed to penetrate, would reduce the higher
temperatures of the city center.
56
56 – 1 Alfred Wegener’s Theory of Continental
Drift
In 1912, the German geologist Alfred Wegener
proposed that Earth's continents are mobile rafts of
lighter crust that have shifted over time by plowing
their way through the denser crust of the oceans.
The theory, called continental drift, was partly
motivated by the apparent fit, like puzzle pieces, of
the coastlines of South America and Africa.
Wegener first presented his theory of continental
drift at a meeting and in a paper, and then as a
book. The Origin of Continents and Oceans,
published in 1915. He continued to write updated
versions of this work until his death in an ill-fated
expedition to Greenland in 1930. Wegener
maintained that Earth is composed of concentric
shells of increasing density from crust to core. The
outermost shell is not continuous but made of
continental blocks of lighter rock called sial (an
acronym for silica- and aluminum-rich rock) floating
in the denser sima (silica- and magnesia-rich rock)
underlying the oceans. All the continents had been
joined in the supercontinent of Pangaea. As the
continent broke up, the pieces moving apart left
bits behind, explaining the presence of nonvolcanic
islands and island chains, according to Wegener.
Where the moving pieces collided, mountains
formed. They were thrust up either by the plowing
of the continents through the sima, as in the case
of the Andes, or by the colliding of two blocks of
sial, as in the case of the Himalayas. As for the
force driving continental drift, Wegener initially
invoked Polfluchtkraft-a force causing flight from
the poles as a result of Earth’s rotation-and later
the tidal force resulting from the gravitational
attraction between Earth and the Moon and Sun.
One of the most influential geologists to join the
mobilist camp, as the drifters school became
known, was Arthur Holmes. Holmes recognized the
importance of radioactive heat-which had recently
been discovered-and realized that there must be a
mechanism to remove it from Earth’s interior. That
mechanism, he argued, is convection-the rising of
less dense material and the sinking of more dense
material. He went on to propose that the mantle
(the part of Earth’s interior below the outer crust
and above the core) convects in large, circulating
patterns, and that this motion carries the continents
across Earth’s surface He also related crustal
movement and mantle convection to the evolution
of mountain belts. Wegener adopted Holmes's
mechanism in the last rendition of his theory
Holmes, for his part, presented his grand concept
of a dynamic Earth in his influential and popular
text Principles of Physical Geology, published in
1944.
Although it was eventually supplanted by the theory
of plate tectonics, Wegener’s theory of continental
drift influenced science because it explained
disparate observations, because it was placed in
the context of existing theories, and because it
offered a coherent view of Earth's evolution. For
example, Wegener showed not only that the
coastlines on opposite sides of the Atlantic fit
together, but that geologic features on the different
continents fit as well. He asserted that the
Appalachians, which can be traced northward
through the Canadian Maritime Provinces, match
the Caledonian Mountains in Scotland and Norway.
He marshaled evidence from the distributions of
fossil and living species to argue that land bridges
joining continents were less likely than a single
continent. The example commonly cited is that of
Mesosaurus, a shoreline scavenger reptile that
lived in the Permian period and is found as fossils
in rocks on both sides of the South Atlantic Ocean.
Mesosaurus was thought not to be a great
swimmer, certainly not able to cross an ocean.
Wegener also found supporting evidence in ancient
climates. Mounting observations indicated that the
past climate of many regions was much different
from the present climate. In the tropics, geologists
had found sand and gravel left by ancient glaciers,
and in rainy regions they had located prehistoric
deserts. Then there was the discovery, by a British
expedition, of plant fossils only 600 kilometers (370
miles) from the South Pole. Particularly puzzling
was evidence suggesting that widely different
climates in different regions had occurred at the
same time, so one could not account for different
climates by claiming simply that the whole of Earth
was once hotter or once cooler than now. Wegener
solved this dilemma by showing that observations
of paleoclimate could be explained if the positions
of the continents had shifted relative to those of the
poles.
57
59 – 2 Dealing with Extreme Cold
There are a number of environments in which
organisms are exposed to temperatures below 0°C
and thus the risk of freezing. In polar regions,
terrestrial organisms are exposed to freezing
temperatures for most of the year. In more
temperate regions, they may have to tolerate
several months of winter, when subzero
temperatures persist for long periods of time. High
mountains are another place where there is
permanent snow and ice, even at the equator.
Exposure to subzero temperatures may occur on a
daily and/or seasonal basis.
Endothermic animals (warm-blooded animals) can
stop their bodies from freezing by generating their
own heat. They retain heat because of the
insulation provided by feathers or fur, and the layer
of fat beneath the skin. Other heat conservation
measures include huddling together, recovering
heat from exhaled breath, and recovering heat from
the extremities of the body. Endotherms can
remain active in the cold if they can find enough
food, or they can reduce their metabolism and lie
dormant until warmer conditions return. Although
air temperatures may be low, the temperature
beneath an insulating layer of snow, under the
ground, or at the bottom of a lake may remain
above 0°C. Most organisms, however, can neither
generate their own heat nor avoid the freezing
temperatures, and for them, the choice is to survive
ice formation within their bodies or to prevent their
bodies from freezing.
Organisms run the risk of freezing at temperatures
that are below the melting point of their body and
cell fluids. There are two main responses: either
they can survive ice forming within them (they are
freezing tolerant) or they have mechanisms that
ensure that their fluids remain liquid at
temperatures that are below the freezing point of
water and the melting point of their body fluids
(they are freeze avoiding). The strategy that an
organism uses depends on the structure and
physiology it has developed during its evolutionary
history and on the particular demands of its
environment. If the organism is living in a wet or
damp environment, ice is likely to make contact
with its surface when its surroundings freeze This
may cause its body fluids to freeze by the ice
traveling across the cell or body wall, or through
body openings-a process known as inoculative
freezing. Most organisms surviving low
temperatures in such environments are thus likely
to be freezing tolerant, since inoculative freezing
will cause their bodies to freeze Some, however,
may have a structure such as a cuticle, eggshell,
cocoon, or sheath that allows them to prevent
inoculative freezing by acting as a barrier to the
spread of ice into their bodies This allows them to
maintain their body or cell fluids as liquids, despite
the fact that their surfaces are in contact with
external ice, and enables them to avoid inoculative
freezing. In a situation where the organism is likely
to be exposed to subzero temperatures with little or
no water in contact with its surface (many terrestrial
insects, for example), it does not have the problem
of inoculative freezing and it is perhaps easier for it
to maintain its body fluids in a liquid state at low
temperatures and thus survive by avoiding
freezing.
The two strategies of cold survival are, however,
not always mutually exclusive. There have been a
few reports of insects that were apparently freezing
tolerant switching to being freeze avoiding. The
overwintering larvae of a beetle from northern
Indiana, when studied in the winters of 1977-1979.
froze at -8°C to -12°C but survived down to -28°C.
When examined again in 1982, however, they froze
and were killed at -26°C, apparently switching from
a freezing-tolerant to a freeze-avoiding strategy
during the intervening years. There are adaptations
in common between freeze-avoiding and freezingtolerant insects that may make it easy to switch
between the two strategies. It must be said,
however, there has been only one other report of
an insect, another beetle, displaying a shift in
strategy of this sort. One Antarctic nematode is
freezing tolerant when immersed in water but,
when free of surface water, there is, of course, no
inoculative freezing and it can survive by avoiding
freezing. The cold-tolerance strategy displayed
thus depends on the particular characteristics of
the animal's microenvironment.
58
60 – 3 Earth’s Core
Knowledge of Earth’s deep interior is derived from
the study of the waves produced by earthquakes,
called seismic waves Among the various kinds of
seismic waves are primary waves (P-waves) and
secondary waves (S-waves). Primary and
secondary waves pass deep within Earth and
therefore are the most instructive. Study of abrupt
changes in the characteristics of seismic waves at
different depths provides the basis for a threefold
division of Earth into a central core; a thick,
overlying mantle: and a thin, enveloping crust.
Sudden changes in seismic wave velocities and
angles of transmission are termed discontinuities.
One of the discontinuities is the Gutenberg
discontinuity, which is located nearly halfway to the
center of Earth at a depth of 2,900 kilometers and
marks the outer boundary of Earth's core. At that
depth, the S-waves cannot propagate, while at the
same time P-wave velocity is drastically reduced Swaves are unable to travel through fluids. Thus, if
S-waves were to encounter a fluidlike region of
Earth’s interior, they would be absorbed there and
would not be able to continue. Geophysicists
believe this is what happens to S-waves as they
enter the outer core. As a result, the S-waves
generated on one side of Earth fail to appear at
seismograph stations on the opposite side of Earth,
and this observation is the principal evidence of an
outer core that behaves as a fluid. Unlike S-waves,
P-waves are able to pass through liquids They are,
however, abruptly slowed and sharply refracted
(bent) as they enter a fluid medium. Therefore, as
P-waves encounter the molten outer core of Earth,
their velocity is reduced and they are refracted
downward.
The radius of the core is about 3,500 kilometers.
The inner core is solid and has a radius of about
1,220 kilometers, which makes this inner core
slightly larger than the Moon. Most geologists
believe that the inner core has the same
composition as the outer core and that it can only
exist as a solid because of the enormous pressure
at the center of Earth. Evidence of the existence of
a solid inner core is derived from the study of
hundreds of records of seismic waves produced
over several years. These studies showed that the
inner core behaves seismically as if it were a solid.
Earth has an overall density of 5.5 grams per cubic
centimeter, yet the average density of rocks at the
surface is less than 3.0 grams per cubic centimeter.
This difference indicates that materials of high
density must exist in the deep interior of the planet
to achieve the 5.5 grams per cubic centimeter
overall density. Under the extreme pressure
conditions that exist in the region of the core, iron
mixed with nickel would very likely have the
required high density. Laboratory experiments,
however, suggest that a highly pressurized ironnickel alloy might be too dense and that minor
amounts of such elements such as silicon, sulfur,
carbon, or oxygen may also be present to lighten
the core material.
Support for the theory that the core is composed of
iron (85 percent) with lesser amounts of nickel has
come from the study of meteorites. Many of these
samples of solar system materials are iron
meteorites that consist of metallic iron alloyed with
a small percentage of nickel. Some geologists
suspect that iron meteorites may be fragments from
the core of a shattered planet. The presence of iron
meteorites in our solar system suggests that the
existence of an iron-nickel core for Earth is
plausible.
There is further evidence that Earth may have a
metallic core. Anyone who understands the
functioning of a compass is aware that Earth has a
magnetic field. The planet itself behaves as if there
was a great bar magnet embedded within it. A
magnetic field is developed by the flow of electric
charges and requires good electrical conductors.
Silicate rocks, such as those in the mantle and
crust, do not conduct electricity very well, whereas
metals such as iron and nickel are good
conductors. Heat-driven movements in the outer
core, coupled with movements induced by Earth’s
spin, are thought to provide the necessary flow of
electrons (very small particles that carry a negative
charge) around the inner core that produces the
magnetic field. Without a metallic core, Earth’s
magnetic field would not be possible.
59
61 – 2 Conditions on Earth When Life Began
In the 1920s, Aleksandr Oparin, a Russian
biochemist, proposed and developed the idea that
life originated in the warm, watery environment of
early Earth’s surface, under an atmosphere mostly
composed of methane. The early seas were
believed by Oparin to be rich in simple organic
molecules, which reacted to form more complex
molecules, eventually leading to proteins and life.
Then, almost 30 years after Oparin published his
ideas, Stanley Miller demonstrated that amino
acids, the building blocks of the proteins necessary
for life, could form under conditions thought to
prevail on early Earth. Miller’s experiment was
elegant. He passed electric discharges through a
mixture of methane, hydrogen, ammonia, and
steam, and when he analyzed the results, found
that he had made amino acids. The discharges
were a proxy for lightning, the gas mixture an
educated guess about what the early atmosphere
may have been like. Amino acids cannot replicate
themselves, and are not themselves alive.
Nevertheless, this experiment has long been
recognized as a landmark for understanding a
process that must have been one of the important
steps in the evolution of life on Earth, the natural
synthesis of amino acids However, it now seems
likely that Miller’s experiments may not be directly
applicable to the events of the early Archean (that
is, early in the geologic eon that lasted from Earth’s
formation until about 2.5 billion years ago).
One of the problems hindering understanding of
the origin of life is that environmental conditions on
early Earth are not known with any certainty. It is
possible to make only reasoned estimates. For
example, for some fairly long period of time after
formation, perhaps as much as several hundred
million years, the surface must have been much
hotter than it is today. Continued impacts of
meteorites, large and small, would have added
further heat energy, and in the earliest part of Earth
history the larger impacting bodies may have
broken through the cooling crust to expose
underlying molten material Large quantities of
volcanic gases would have been released into the
atmosphere as lavas erupted onto the surface,
producing a greenhouse effect far more severe
than anything likely to result from human activity. It
is quite possible that the early atmosphere was
many times as dense as today’s, and that the seas
and oceans were hot. Some have even suggested
that because of the high atmospheric pressure, the
oceans could have been hotter than the boiling
point of water today However, life as we know it is
quite sensitive to temperature, and no modern
organisms are known to survive much above
100°C It is unlikely that life became established
until surface temperatures had decreased to this
level, or lower.
Although we do not know the precise composition
of the early atmosphere, there has been enough
progress made on this subject in recent years that
it is possible to say with some certainty that the
methane-rich composition envisioned by Oparin,
and the methane-ammonia-hydrogen mixture used
by Miller in his experiments, are probably not very
realistic. Based on studies of our closest neighbor
planets, Mars and Venus, and also considering
evidence from Earth’s sedimentary rocks, it seems
probable that Earth’s early atmosphere was rich in
carbon dioxide rather than methane. On both Mars
and Venus, carbon dioxide is by far the most
abundant gas in the atmosphere. On Earth it is a
minor constituent. But there is an enormous
amount of this compound buried in the sedimentary
rocks of Earth’s crust, enough so that, if it were all
released, our atmosphere would be much more like
those of our neighboring planets. How did carbon
dioxide gas end up in the crust? The answer lies in
what geologists refer to as the carbon cycle
Through a series of chemical reactions, carbon
dioxide from the atmosphere finds itself, in
dissolved form, in the oceans. In seawater it
combines with calcium to precipitate as calcium
carbonate, the main constituent of limestone Over
geologic time so much carbon dioxide from the
atmosphere has been converted to limestone in
this fashion that there is more than 100,000 times
as much stored as limestone as there is in the
atmosphere.
60
60 – 1 Underground Life
Until about the late 1980s, most scientists believed
that life was restricted to the top few meters of the
soil or ocean sediments. The few reports of
organisms being recovered from great depths
within Earth were dismissed as contamination with
material from the surface layers. Two technical
developments changed this view. The first was the
development of drilling techniques that gave
confidence that samples could be retrieved from
depth without contamination. Samples were
recovered using a diamond-studded drill bit that
headed a great length of rotating steel pipe from a
drilling derrick. A concentrated tracer material was
added to the lubricating fluid so that when a deep
sample of rock was removed, any contaminated
material could be identified and cut away to leave a
pristine sample of rock from deep within Earth. The
second development was the advent of techniques
for identifying microorganisms without having to
grow them in culture. All organisms contain DNA,
and their presence can be revealed by dyes that
either stain DNA directly or can be attached to
nucleic acid probes. By varying the nucleic acid
probe, scientists can demonstrate the presence of
different types of microorganisms.
The first scientists to use these techniques were
involved in the Subsurface Science Program of the
United States Department of Energy (DOE). They
were interested in the possibility that if organisms
existed in the depths of Earth, they might degrade
organic pollutants and help maintain the purity of
groundwater or, rather less usefully, degrade the
containers in which the DOE was proposing to
deposit the radioactive waste from nuclear facilities.
They demonstrated the presence of many different
types of microorganisms in rocks at depths down to
500 meters beneath the surface. Since then,
microbes have been discovered in many different
types of rocks and deep within ocean sediments.
The record depth at which life has been found is at
the bottom of a South African gold mine, 3.5
kilometers below ground Pressure and temperature
increase as you go deeper into Earth. Some
scientists think that subsurface bacteria could
withstand temperatures as high as 150°C. This
would allow organisms to exist to depths of about 7
kilometers beneath the seafloor and to 4 kilometers
below the surface of the land. Although the
organisms are often sparsely distributed, this is
such an enormous volume that it has been
estimated that the total biomass of deep
subsurface organisms exceeds that of those living
on, or just below, the surface.
Bacteria are the most numerous of these
subsurface organisms, but there are also fungi and
protozoa Some 10,000 strains of microorganism
have been isolated from subsurface cores. Each
gram of rock contains anything from 100 bacteria to
10 million bacteria (compared with more than 1
billion per gram in agricultural soils); ocean
sediments contain even higher numbers. The
protozoa feed on the bacteria, forming part of a
simple subterranean food chain, but what do the
bacteria feed on? Sedimentary rocks are formed
from sands and from ocean, river, or lake
sediments that have organic material trapped
within them. Microbes living in pores within the
sediments can utilize these ancient nutrients and
grow. As sedimentary rocks are buried more
deeply, they become increasingly compacted and
their pores filled with minerals. The distribution of
microorganisms is thus likely to become more
patchy, condensed into the remaining pores and
concentrations of nutrients. The bulk of Earth’s
crust, however, consists of igneous rocks, such as
granite and basalt, which are solidified from molten
magma. These rocks were too hot to support life
when they were first formed; the organisms that
inhabit cracks and fissures within the rocks are
carried there by the groundwater flowing through
them. Subsurface bacteria do not just rely on
nutrients trapped within the rock or carried there by
groundwater. Some are chemotrophs, deriving their
energy from the oxidation of iron or sulfur
compounds and building organic material directly
from the carbon dioxide and hydrogen gas
dissolved in the rock. These bacteria excrete
organic compounds that are then utilized by other
types of bacteria. These ecosystems based on
chemotrophic bacteria are completely independent
of material and solar energy from the surface.
61
61 – 1 Physical Properties of Minerals
A mineral is a naturally occurring solid formed by
inorganic processes. Since the internal structure
and chemical composition of a mineral are difficult
to determine without the aid of sophisticated tests
and apparatus, the more easily recognized physical
properties are used in identification.
Most people think of a crystal as a rare commodity,
when in fact most inorganic solid objects are
composed of crystals. The reason for this
misconception is that most crystals do not exhibit
their crystal form: the external form of a mineral
that reflects the orderly internal arrangement of its
atoms. Whenever a mineral forms without space
restrictions, individual crystals with well-formed
crystal faces will develop Some crystals, such as
those of the mineral quartz, have a very distinctive
crystal form that can be helpful in identification.
However, most of the time, crystal growth is
interrupted because of competition for space,
resulting in an intergrown mass of crystals, none of
which exhibits crystal form.
Although color is an obvious feature of a mineral, it
is often an unreliable diagnostic property. Slight
impurities in the common mineral quartz, for
example, give it a variety of colors, including pink,
purple (amethyst), white, and even black. When a
mineral, such as quartz, exhibits a variety of colors,
it is said to possess exotic coloration. Exotic
coloration is usually caused by the inclusion of
impurities, such as foreign ions, in the crystalline
structure. Other minerals-for example, sulfur, which
is yellow, and malachite, which is bright green-are
said to have inherent coloration because their color
is a consequence of their chemical makeup and
does not vary significantly.
Streak is the color of a mineral in its powdered form
and is obtained by rubbing a mineral across a plate
of unglazed porcelain. Whereas the color of a
mineral often varies from sample to sample, the
streak usually does not and is therefore the more
reliable property.
Luster is the appearance or quality of light reflected
from the surface of a mineral. Minerals that have
the appearance of metals, regardless of color, are
said to have a metallic luster. Minerals with a
nonmetallic luster are described by various
adjectives, including vitreous (glassy), pearly, silky,
resinous, and earthy (dull).
One of the most useful diagnostic properties of a
mineral is hardness, the resistance of a mineral to
abrasion or scratching. This property is determined
by rubbing a mineral of unknown hardness against
one of known hardness, or vice versa. A numerical
value can be obtained by using Mohs' scale of
hardness, which consists of ten minerals arranged
in order from talc, the softest, at number one, to
diamond, the hardest, at number ten. Any mineral
of unknown hardness can be compared with these
or with other objects of known hardness. For
example, a fingernail has a hardness of 2.5, a
copper penny 5, and a piece of glass 5.5. The
mineral gypsum, which has a hardness of two, can
be easily scratched with your fingernail. On the
other hand, the mineral calcite, which has a
hardness of three, will scratch your fingernail but
will not scratch glass Quartz, the hardest of the
common minerals, will scratch a glass plate.
The tendency of a mineral to break along planes of
weak bonding is called cleavage. Minerals that
possess cleavage are identified by the smooth, flat
surfaces produced when the mineral is broken. The
simplest type of cleavage is exhibited by the micas.
Because the micas have excellent cleavage in one
direction, they break to form thin, flat sheets. Some
minerals have several cleavage planes, which
produce smooth surfaces when broken, while
others exhibit poor cleavage, and still others exhibit
no cleavage at all. When minerals break evenly in
more than one direction, cleavage is described by
the number of planes exhibited and the angles at
which they meet. Cleavage should not be confused
with crystal form. When a mineral exhibits
cleavage, it will break into pieces that have the
same configuration as the original sample does. By
contrast, quartz crystals do not have cleavage, and
if broken, would shatter into shapes that do not
resemble each other or the original crystals.
Minerals that do not exhibit cleavage are said to
fracture when broken. Some break into pieces with
smooth curved surfaces resembling broken glass.
Others break into splinters or fibers, but most
fracture irregularly.
62
63 – 2 Structure and Composition of Comets
Astronomers now have a fairly good idea of what a
comet really is. When it is far from the Sun, it is a
very small object only a few kilometers across It
consists mainly of ices (water, methane, ammonia)
with bits of dust embedded in it-a kind of dirty ice
ball. As it approaches the Sun, radiation from the
Sun vaporizes the icy matter and releases some of
the dust. This forms a gigantic halo around the ice
ball. This halo-called the coma-extends out tens of
thousands of kilometers from the icy core, which is
the nucleus of the comet. Sunlight reflected off the
dust particles makes the coma visible to observers
on Earth. Ultraviolet radiation from the Sun breaks
down the vapor molecules into their constituents.
These components can be excited by absorbing
radiation from the Sun. In returning to lower-energy
states, the excited atoms and ions emit light,
contributing to the luminosity of the coma.
When the comet gets even closer to the Sun, one
of its most spectacular parts begins to form-the tail.
Actually, there are two kinds of tails the dust tail
and the ion tail. The dust tail is produced by the
light from the Sun reflecting off the dust particles in
the coma. A photon carries momentum. In
bouncing off a dust particle, it imparts a tiny, but
perceptible, momentum change to the dust particle,
driving it away from the coma. As the comet
sweeps along its orbit, it leaves a curving trail of
dust behind in its path. This visible dust tail can
extend for tens or hundreds of millions of
kilometers out from the nucleus. The dust tail is
characterized by its gently curving shape and its
yellowish color.
A different mechanism is responsible for the ion
tail. Near the Sun, ultraviolet radiation from the Sun
(solar wind) ionizes and excites the atoms in the
coma. As the solar wind sweeps through the coma,
the high-velocity charged particles of the solar wind
interact with the electrically charged excited ions in
the coma, driving them away from the head of the
comet. In returning to lower-energy states, these
excited ions emit photons and form a luminous,
bluish-colored tail extending out from the comet
directly away from the Sun. Since both kinds of tails
are produced by radiation streaming out from the
Sun, they extend out from the coma in the general
direction away from the Sun. A comet may exhibit
several tails of each kind.
Although the nucleus is of the order of a few
kilometers in size, the diameter of the coma may be
tens or hundreds of thousands of kilometers, the
tails typically extend out tens or hundreds of
millions of kilometers away from the coma.
A comet leaves a trail of matter behind it as it
moves through the inner solar system. Some of this
debris may get strewn across Earth’s orbit around
the Sun. When Earth passes through this part of its
annual path, it sweeps through the dust trail. The
particles enter Earth’s atmosphere at high velocity.
The air friction can cause one of these bits of
matter to produce a brief streak of light as it burns
up in the atmosphere.
Since a comet loses matter on each pass by the
Sun, eventually it will be depleted to the point
where it is no longer visible. Comets that approach
the Sun have finite lifetimes. Given the typical sizes
of comets and the typical rates at which they lose
matter, astronomers have concluded that the
lifetimes of comets with orbits that bring them near
enough to the Sun to be seen from Earth are very
much shorter than the age of the solar system.
Where do the new comets come from to replace
the old ones that dissipate and vanish from view?
Dutch astronomer Jan Oort proposed that a giant
cloud of matter left over from the formation of the
solar system surrounds the Sun and extends out to
about 50,000 astronomical units. This cloud
contains large chunks of matter like the nuclei of
comets. The gravitational influence of a passing
star can be sufficient to perturb the orbit of one of
these chunks to send it toward the inner solar
system and bring it near the Sun.

66 – 2 Visions of the Land
Successive generations of North Americans have
viewed their continent's natural environment in
different ways. From the vantage point of the
present it is clear that perceptions of the land have
changed dramatically from the first years of
settlement to the Civil War. Not only have such
visions often shifted, but also different peoples
have used their particular perspective to reshape
the land itself and make it fit their own sense of
what nature should be. If the consequences of
some changes, such as cutting forests and filling in
lowlands, have been deliberate and purposeful-to
open the landscape and create sweeping vistas, for
example-other human undertakings, such as
mining and dam building, have brought results
neither anticipated nor intended. Native peoples,
no less than the first colonists and subsequent
immigrants to North America, have reshaped the
natural environment to meet their physical wants
and spiritual needs Indeed, much of the landscape
we know today reflects patterns of use and abuse
that began several centuries ago.
Long before the first European settlers reached the
continent's eastern shores, native peoples had
developed agricultural practices that had changed
the face of the land. By cutting away the bark to kill
trees selectively, Indians in the Virginia tidewater
(low, coastal land) and much of the Northeast had
cleared space to plant small gardens of corn,
squash, beans, and melons. Although the first
English immigrants described the countryside as
almost entirely wooded, the forests provided
canopies of large, well-spaced trees under which a
horse and rider could pass unhindered. By
frequently moving their garden plots to find morefertile soil and by periodically burning the
undergrowth, Indians had further opened the land,
in this way facilitating their hunting of deer and
other game. Native American visions of the
landscape not surprisingly featured people living in
harmony with nature, whose riches they celebrated
in seasonal rituals and through time- honored
practices.
In contrast, the European colonists who intruded on
this harmonious world often viewed it as alien and
menacing; some called it, in the language of the
Bible, a "howling wilderness." The newcomers to
America brought with them agricultural practices
and preconceptions about nature based on their
experiences in England. They saw uncultivated
lands as "wastes" that needed to be "broken,"
"dressed." and "improved" . In New England,
transplanted English settlers attempted to subdue
what they considered a fearsome wilderness by
mapping the countryside, draining marshlands
clearing pastures, fencing particular parcels, and
planting wheat and other familiar crops. Within
twenty years of the initial Puritan settlement,
Edward Johnson boasted of the newcomers'
achievements: "This remote, rocky, barren, bushy,
wild-woody wilderness, a receptacle for lions,
wolves, bears, foxes, racoons, beavers, otters, and
all kind of wild creatures, a place that never
afforded the Natives better than the flesh of a few
wild creatures and parched Indian corn inched out
with chestnuts and bitter acorns, now through the
mercy of Christ [has] become a second England for
fertility in so short a space, that it is indeed the
wonder of the world".
So, rather than adapting to their new land, the
English either changed it by cutting trees, building
farms, and plowing or searched for soil and
landscape features that reminded them of the
English countryside. Seeking to tame the land and
to conquer their fear of it. generations of
seventeenth- and eighteenth-century settlers
nevertheless failed to gain the mastery they
desired. In part, this failure resulted from their
custom of settling along waterways. To expedite
travel and facilitate the shipment of agricultural
produce, newcomers invariably built their homes
along rivers. Despite the colonists' attempts to
control waterways through dams, rivers never failed
to remind them of nature's unpredictability and
power. Rivers could and often did, change course
abruptly or flood during sudden rainstorms. Not
until the middle of the eighteenth century did the
colonists begin to discard their negative view of the
landscape as a wilderness to be feared and
controlled, and to substitute the idea that nature
could be as much useful as fearsome.

66 – 4 Geology and Landscape
Most people consider the landscape to be
unchanging, but Earth is a dynamic body, and its
surface is continually altering-slowly on the human
time scale, but relatively rapidly when compared to
the great age of Earth (about 4,500 billion years).
There are two principal influences that shape the
terrain: constructive processes such as uplift, which
create new landscape features, and destructive
forces such as erosion, which gradually wear away
exposed landforms.
Hills and mountains are often regarded as the
epitome of permanence, successfully resisting the
destructive forces of nature, but in fact they tend to
be relatively short-lived in geological terms. As a
general rule, the higher a mountain is, the more
recently it was formed; for example, the high
mountains of the Himalayas are only about 50
million years old. Lower mountains tend to be
older, and are often the eroded relics of much
higher mountain chains. About 400 million years
ago, when the present-day continents of North
America and Europe were joined, the Caledonian
mountain chain was the same size as the modern
Himalayas. Today, however, the relics of the
Caledonian orogeny (mountain-building period)
exist as the comparatively low mountains of
Greenland, the northern Appalachians in the United
States, the Scottish Highlands, and the Norwegian
coastal plateau.
The Earth's crust is thought to be divided into huge,
movable segments, called plates, which float on a
soft plastic layer of rock. Some mountains were
formed as a result of these plates crashing into
each other and forcing up the rock at the plate
margins. In this process, sedimentary rocks that
originally formed on the seabed may be folded
upwards to altitudes of more than 26,000 feet.
Other mountains may be raised by earthquakes,
which fracture the Earth's crust and can displace
enough rock to produce block mountains. A third
type of mountain may be formed as a result of
volcanic activity which occurs in regions of active
fold mountain belts, such as in the Cascade Range
of western North America. The Cascades are made
up of lavas and volcanic materials. Many of the
peaks are extinct volcanoes.
Whatever the reason for mountain formation, as
soon as land rises above sea level it is subjected to
destructive forces. The exposed rocks are attacked
by the various weather processes and gradually
broken down into fragments, which are then carried
away and later deposited as sediments. Thus, any
landscape represents only a temporary stage in the
continuous battle between the forces of uplift and
those of erosion.
The weather, in its many forms, is the main agent
of erosion. Rain washes away loose soil and
penetrates cracks in the rocks. Carbon dioxide in
the air reacts with the rainwater, forming a weak
acid (carbonic acid) that may chemically attack the
rocks. The rain seeps underground and the water
may reappear later as springs. These springs are
the sources of streams and rivers, which cut
through the rocks and carry away debris from the
mountains to the lowlands.
Under very cold conditions, rocks can be shattered
by ice and frost. Glaciers may form in permanently
cold areas, and these slowly moving masses of ice
cut out valleys, carrying with them huge quantities
of eroded rock debris. In dry areas the wind is the
principal agent of erosion. It carries fine particles of
sand, which bombard exposed rock surfaces,
thereby wearing them into yet more sand. Even
living things contribute to the formation of
landscapes. Tree roots force their way into cracks
in rocks and, in so doing, speed their splitting. In
contrast, the roots of grasses and other small
plants may help to hold loose soil fragments
together, thereby helping to prevent erosion by the
wind.
65
65 – 2 Early Research on Air
In the field of chemistry, the understanding of the
word “air" has undergone radical change. Air for
John Mayow, a seventeenth-century chemist, was
essentially a receptacle for airborne particles, and
through them manifested a variety of chemical
properties. But although Mayow and a few other
chemists did detect specific chemical properties in
what we call gases (including our carbon dioxide),
most chemists left them unaccounted for until the
beginning of the eighteenth century. As chemists
became aware that the atmosphere itself (and not
just particles within it) had a role to play in
combustion, respiration, and other reactions, they
did not attribute this to the chemical properties of
air but rather to substances that air could absorb
and release according to circumstances. Thus, air
provided a physical environment in which some
reactions took place.
In the early 1700s, the air was widely seen as just
such an environment, and “air” and “the air” were
one and the same thing. Chemists were not in the
habit of regarding airs or gases as having different
chemical properties. There was simply air. One
obvious reason for this was practical. Chemists
could examine solids and liquids, exposing them to
a variety of tests and seeing how they contributed
to assorted reactions. Chemists had, however, no
comparable way of examining air, and they came to
view chemistry as the sum total of the reactions of
solids and liquids, excluding gases. Chemists
stressed chemical qualities over physical properties
like weight and let physicists deal with air.
Chemists generally did not examine air, and they
did not try to weigh it. That does not mean that
chemists did not weigh substances. They did a lot
of weighing, and pharmacists and metallurgists did
more. But weighing gases was outside their brief.
In the Encyclopedia of Diderot and d'Alembert,
published between 1751 and 1775, readers were
told that “the incoercibility of gases will remove
them from our researches for a long time to come.”
By the time of the Encyclopedia, however, this had
begun to change. One of the first and key sources
of change was the invention by the Reverend
Stephen Hales of a new instrument, the pneumatic
trough. This instrument is important for what it
made possible in the handling of air. The history of
its invention and early use illustrates the difference
there may be between the motives for inventing a
device and the ways in which that device is used.
Hales was a botanist and chemist as well as a
physiologist. He wrote a book in 1727 investigating
mechanical subjects like the pressure of sap in
plants. But Hales went further, addressing chemical
as well as physiological questions. He urged
chemists to consider air chemically. He described
an instrument for washing the air produced in the
course of a chemical reaction. He wanted to get rid
of impurities in the air by letting it pass through
water. Air passed from a reaction vessel through
water in a trough (or tube) and then into a second
vessel that was partly filled with water and that
could capture air.
In devising this apparatus, Hales had coincidentally
furnished an instrument for catching and holding
air, which could then be subjected to various tests.
Used in this way the apparatus became known as
the pneumatic trough half a century after its
invention, it became a staple of the chemical
laboratory. It also became one of the key
instruments in the reform of chemistry that we know
as the chemical revolution because it was essential
to incorporating a whole new state of matter, the
gaseous state, into chemistry, alongside the
already studied solid and liquid states. Once that
step had been taken, it was possible to speculate
and then to demonstrate that the gaseous state,
like the solid and liquid states, could contain a
variety of chemical substances. This was an
enormous step, and it did not happen overnight.
Hales had shown that air could be contained,
washed, and purified, and tested chemically as well
as physically. This, however, did not lead him to
think that there was more than one kind of air. Air
for him remained air, not one of a number of airs.
Other chemists would take that essential step.
66
69 – 2 Pacific Ecosystems
The Pacific Ocean accounts for one-third of Earth’s
surface and half of the world’s ocean area. It has
about 25,000 islands, of which about 7,500 are
oceanic, being relatively far from a continental
shore. The great majority of all Pacific islands were
born barren of life; hard, dense, volcanic rock
pimples on the sea’s surface. New Zealand is the
chief exception. It is among the continental islands
of the western Pacific, together with Fiji, the
Solomons, and others to the west.
Life arrived on most other islands by accident or by
drift. Some plants arrived by air transport; seeds
carried in the digestive tracts of birds account for
nearly 40 percent of Hawaii’s early plants. The first
invaders were either creatures that could float well
enough, in air or water to cross stretches of ocean,
or those whose seeds could survive a voyage in
some bird’s gut. At times of lower sea level, land
bridges linked, or nearly linked, many islands in the
far western Pacific, so some species colonized
these islands without being notably good floaters or
stowaways. In the eastern Pacific (Easter Island,
for example) only the best floaters and travelers
arrived and survived. Consequently, the western
islands have far more species and far greater
biodiversity than do the eastern islands of
Polynesia. Mammals found it hard to get anywhere
in the island Pacific, only bats and rats successfully
colonized eat of New Guinea. Almost all species
derive from Asia, the early Pacific was an Asian
lake, with only a tiny proportion of species from the
Americas. As a rule of thumb, the further from
Indonesia, the more impoverished the plant and
animal life and, in consequence, the less stable
and resilient in the face of disturbance. This
attenuation is strong for land species, less strong
for marine species, and nonexistent for oceanic
birds although fairly strong for land birds.
Pacific ecosystems evolved in relative (but
differential) isolation from the continental crucibles
of biological evolution. This meant opportunities for
speciation – the development of new species
occupying ecological niches elsewhere – were
already filled. The finches described by the
naturalist Charles Darwin on the Galapagos Islands
– birds that divided into different species, each
specialized for a narrow niche – are the classic
example. On islands that had no mammals, reptiles
and birds took their place. Thus the Galapagos
have giant tortoises, and New Zealand once had
giant birds that functioned more or less like
browsing or grazing mammals. Throughout most of
the Pacific, the paucity of grazing animals meant
that plants developed no defenses, such as spines,
poisonous chemicals, or bitterness. The remote
islands had a very high proportion of endemism –
that is, of species that existed only there. In the
case of Hawaii, as many as 99 percent of the
species were endemic. All this led to a certain
biological vulnerability among the terrestrial island
species, should they ever be obliged to compete
for niche space with the winders of the more
intense continental competitions for survival. This
vulnerability increased toward the east and toward
the remote corners of the Pacific along a gradient
defined chiefly by the degree of isolation.
A second source of vulnerability, perhaps more
decisive arose from the arrival of humankind in the
Pacific. Island animals evolved with no experience
of the ways of humankind or indeed of any large
terrestrial predators. As a result, they had to
immunities to the predators or the effects of human
action. Pacific animals were often unwary and easy
prey. At the extreme again the Galapagos, Darwin
found many birds almost tame, so naively trusting
that they would allow him to get within arm’s reach.
Pacific plants had little experience with fire,
because natural fires were very rare: except in a
few places. Thus few plants were well adapted to
fire and most proved vulnerable to it. In contrast,
continental species that had evolved in the
presence of humankind or in places where natural
fire is much more common, could recover easily
after burns, and some could flourish as a result of
fire. In short, Pacific ecosystems were different
from continental ones on account of their isolation.
They were well adapted to their circumstances but
very vulnerable to alien invasion and human
impact.

68 – 2 Predicting Volcanic Eruptions
Volcanoes are the landforms created when molten
rock, or magma, escapes from vents in the Earth's
surface and then solidifies around these vents. In
any given year, roughly 50 of Earth's active
volcanoes erupt - usually with some warning.
Before they blow, they typically shake,swell, warm
up and belch a variety of gases. Scientists from the
Volcano Disaster Assistance Program (VDAP)-part
of the US. Geological Survey and based at the US.
Geologicai Survey's Cascades Volcano
Observatory in Vancouver, Washington -are always
on call, ready when summoned to rush at a
moment's notice to an awakening volcano
anywhere in the worid; armed with the latest in
lasers, sesmometers, and other monitoring
devices, they can assess the volcano's potential for
violence and predict when it might ignite.
Geologists have enjoyed fair success in predicting
individual eruptive episodes when they concentrate
on a specific volcano after an eruptive phase has
begun. These monitoring efforts involve carefully
measuring changes in a volcano's surface
temperature, watching for the slightest expansion
in its slope, and keeping track of regional
earthquake activity. A laboratory at the University of
Washington in Seattle is staffed 24 hours a day to
monitor the rumblings of Mount St. Helens. Even
with the advances brought by today's technology,
however, the art of volcano prediction has not been
fully mastered. The US. Geological Survey missed
the call on Mount St. Helens' 1980 blast despite the
fact that the mountain was being watched closely
by a large team of scientists armed with the latest
in prediction technology. lt did successfully predict
the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines
evacuating virtually everyone within 25 kilometers
(15 miles) before the volcano's powerful blast on
May 17,1991.
Before a volcano erupts, hot magma rises toward
the surface, so any local manifestation of
increasing heat may signal an impending event.
Ongoing surveys can identify new surface hot
springs and take the temperature of the water and
steam in existing ones. lf the escaping steam isn't
much hotter than the boiling point of water, then
surface water is probably seeping into the
mountain and being heated by contact with hot
subsurface rocks, and all is well for the time being.
If the steam is superheated, with temperatures as
high as 500°C(900°F),then it probably derives from
shallow watern'ch magma, a sign that an eruption
may be brewing. As magma rises, the volcanic
cone itself begins to heat up.The overall temperatur
of a volcanic cone can be monitored from an
orbiting satellite equipped with infrared heat
sensors to detect the slightest change in surface
temperature. This high-altitude technology serves
as a simultaneous early-warning system for most of
Earths 600 or so active volcanoes. lmpending
eruptions may also be predicted by increased gas
emissions from rising magmas. For this reason,
volcanologists continuously monitor sulfur dioxide
and carbon dioxide emissions from potentially
active volcanoes.
Active volcanoes expand in volume as they acquire
new supplies of magma from below. As a result, an
increase in the steepness or bulging of a volcano's
slope may signal an impending eruption. To detect
the inflation of a volcanic cone, a tilt meter, a
device like a carpenter's level, is used. As magma
rises, it pushes aside fractured rock,enlarging the
fractures as it moves. Because this type of
fracturing causes earthquakes, eruptions are often
preceded by a distinctive pattern of earthquake
activity called harmonic tremors, a continuous
rhythmic rumbling. Sensitive equipment that
monitors the location where these tremors occur
can measure the increased height of rising magma.
The rate at which the magma rises provides an
estimate of when an eruption may occur. Indeed, it
served as the principal means by which scientists
accurately predicted recent eruptions of Mount St.
Helens.
Efforts to predict eruptions are thwarted, however,
when we are unaware of a site's volcanic potential.
Occasionally, a new volcano appears suddenly and
rather unexpectedly, as was the case in 1943,
when the volcano Paricutin developed literally
aovernight in the Mexican state of Michoacan, 320
kilometers (200 miles) west of Mexico City. The
surrounding area was known to be volcanic
because of its geologic zone, but it was not
possible to predict that the volcano would appear at
this particular site. Our ability to predict volcanic
eruptions continues to improve but is not yet as
accurate as we need it to be.

70 – 2 Nineteenth-Century Theories of Mountain
Formation
One of the central scientific questions of
nineteenth-century geology was the origin of
mountains. How were they formed? What process
squeezed and folded rocks like bread dough? What
made Earth’s surface move? Most theories invoked
terrestrial contraction as a causal force. It was
widely believed that Earth had formed as a hot,
incandescent body and had been steadily cooling
since the beginning of geological time. Because
most materials contract as they cool, it seemed
logical to assume that Earth had been contracting
as it cooled, too. As it did, its surface would have
deformed, producing mountains.
In Europe, Austrian geologist Eduard Suess (1831
– 1914) popularized the image of Earth as a drying
apple: as the planet contracted, its surface wrinkled
to accommodate the diminished surface area.
Suess assumed that Earth’s initial crust was
continuous but broke apart as the interior shrank.
The collapsed portions formed the ocean basins,
the remaining elevated portions formed the
continents. With continued cooling, the original
continents became unstable and collapsed to form
the next generation of ocean floor, and what had
formerly been ocean now became dry land. Over
the course of geological history, there would be a
continual interchange of land and sea, a periodic
rearrangement of the landmasses.
The interchangeability of continents and oceans
explained a number of other perplexing geological
observations, such as the presence of marine
fossils on land (which had long before puzzled
Leonardo da Vinci) and the extensive interleaving
of marine and terrestrial sediments in the
stratigraphic record. Suess’s theory also explained
the striking similarities of fossils in parts of Africa
and South America. Indeed, in some cases the
fossils seemed to be identical, even though they
were found thousands of miles apart. These
similarities had been recognized since the midnineteenth century, but they had been made newly
problematic by Darwin’s theory of evolution. If
plants and animals had evolved independently in
different places within diverse environments, then
why did they look so similar? Suess explained this
conundrum by attributing these similar species to
an early geological age when the continents were
contiguous in an ancient supercontinent called
Gondwanaland.
Suess’s theory was widely discussed and to
varying degrees accepted in Europe, but in North
America geologist James Dwight Dana (1813 –
1895) had developed a different version of
contraction theory. Dana suggested that the
continents had formed early in Earth history, when
low-temperature minerals such as quartz and
feldspar had solidified. Then the globe continued to
cool and contract, until the high-temperature
minerals such as olivine and pyroxene finally
solidified – on the Moon, to form the lunar craters;
on Earth, to form the ocean basins. As contraction
continued after Earth was solid, its surface began
to deform. The boundaries between continents and
oceans were most affected by the pressure, and so
mountains began to form along continental
margins. With continued contraction came
continued deformation, but with the continents and
oceans always in the same relative positions.
Although Dana’s theory was a version of
contraction, it came to be known as permanence
theory, because it viewed continents and oceans
as globally permanent features.
In North America permanence theory was linked to
the theory of subsidence (or sinking) of
sedimentary basins along continental margins. This
idea was developed primarily by paleontologist
James Hall (1811 – 1898), who noted that beneath
the forest cover, the Appalachian Mountains of
North America were built up of folded layers of
shallowwater sedimentary rocks, thousands of feet
thick. How did these sequences of shallow-water
deposits form? How were they folded and uplifted
into mountains? Hall suggested that materials
eroded off the continents accumulated in the
adjacent marginal basins, causing the basins to
subside.  Subsidence allowed more sediment to
accumulate, causing more subsidence, until finally
the weight of the pile caused the sediments to be
heated, converted to rock, and then uplifted into
mountains. Dana modified Hall’s view by arguing
that thick sedimentary piles were not the cause of
subsidence but the result of it.Either way, the
theory provided a concise explanation of how thick
sequences of shallow-water rocks could
accumulate, but was vague on the question of how
they were transformed into mountain belts.

SPACE
Astronomy
08 – 3 Running Water on Mars
Photographic evidence suggests that liquid water
once existed in great quantity on the surface of
Mars. Two types of flow features are seen: runoff
channels and outflow channels. Runoff channels
are found in the southern highlands. These flow
features are extensive systems—sometimes
hundreds of kilometers in total length—of
interconnecting, twisting channels that seem to
merge into larger, wider channels. They bear a
strong resemblance to river systems on Earth, and
geologists think that they are dried-up beds of longgone rivers that once carried rainfall on Mars from
the mountains down into the valleys. Runoff
channels on Mars speak of a time 4 billion years
ago (the age of the Martian highlands), when the
atmosphere was thicker, the surface warmer, and
liquid water widespread.
Outflow channels are probably relics of
catastrophic flooding on Mars long ago. They
appear only in equatorial regions and generally do
not form extensive interconnected networks.
Instead, they are probably the paths taken by huge
volumes of water draining from the southern
highlands into the northern plains. The onrushing
water arising from these flash floods likely also
formed the odd teardrop-shaped “islands”
(resembling the miniature versions seen in the wet
sand of our beaches at low tide) that have been
found on the plains close to the ends of the outflow
channels. Judging from the width and depth of the
channels, the flow rates must have been truly
enormous—perhaps as much as a hundred times
greater than the 105 tons per second carried by the
great Amazon River. Flooding shaped the outflow
channels approximately 3 billion years ago, about
the same times as the northern volcanic plains
formed.
Some scientists speculate that Mars may have
enjoyed an extended early Period during which
rivers, lakes, and perhaps even oceans adorned its
surface. A 2003 Mars Global Surveyor image
shows what mission specialists think may be a
delta—a fan-shaped network of channels and
sediments where a river once flowed into a larger
body of water, in this case a lake filling a crater in
the southern highlands. Other researchers go even
further, suggesting that the data provide evidence
for large open expanses of water on the early
Martian surface. A computer-generated view of the
Martian north polar region shows the extent of what
may have been an ancient ocean covering much of
the northern lowlands. The Hellas Basin, which
measures some 3,000 kilometers across and has a
floor that lies nearly 9 kilometers below the basin’s
rim, is another candidate for an ancient Martian
sea.
These ideas remain controversial. Proponents
point to features such as the terraced “beaches”
shown in one image, which could conceivably have
been left behind as a lake or ocean evaporated and
the shoreline receded. But detractors maintain that
the terraces could also have been created by
geological activity, perhaps related to the geologic
forces that depressed the Northern Hemisphere far
below the level of the south, in which case they
have nothing whatever to do with Martian water.
Furthermore, Mars Global Surveyor data released
in 2003 seem to indicate that the Martian surface
contains too few carbonate rock layers—layers
containing compounds of carbon and oxygen—that
should have been formed in abundance in an
ancient ocean. Their absence supports the picture
of a cold, dry Mars that never experienced the
extended mild period required to form lakes and
oceans. However, more recent data imply that at
least some parts of the planet did in fact
experience long periods in the past during which
liquid water existed on the surface.
Aside from some small-scale gullies (channels)
found since 2000, which are inconclusive,
astronomers have no direct evidence for liquid
water anywhere on the surface of Mars today, and
the amount of water vapor in the Martian
atmosphere is tiny. Yet even setting aside the
unproven hints of ancient oceans, the extent of the
outflow channels suggests that a huge total volume
of water existed on Mars in the past. Where did all
the water go? The answer may be that virtually all
the water on Mars is now locked in the permafrost
layer under the surface, with more contained in the
planet’s polar caps.

25 – 1 The surface of Mars
The surface of Mars shows a wide range of
geologic features, including huge volcanoes - the
largest known in the solar system - and extensive
impact cratering. Three very large volcanoes are
found on the Tharsis bulge, an enormous geologic
area near Mars's equator. Northwest of Tharsis is
the largest volcano of all: Olympus Mons, with a
height of 25 kilometers and measuring some 700
kilometers in diameter at its base. The three large
volcanoes on the Tharsis bulge are a little smaller -
"mere" 18 kilometers high.
None of these volcanoes was formed as a result of
collisions between plates of the Martian crust -
there is no plate motion on Mars. Instead, they are
shield volcanoes - volcanoes with broad, sloping
slides formed by molten rock. All four show
distinctive lava channels and other flow features
similar to those found on shield volcanoes on
Earth. Images of the Martian surface reveal many
hundreds of volcanoes. Most of the largest
volcanoes are associated with the Tharsis bulge,
but many smaller ones are found in the northern
plains.
The great height of Martian volcanoes is a direct
consequence of the planet's low surface gravity. As
lava flows and spreads to form a shield volcano,
the volcano's eventual height depends on the new
mountain's ability to support its own weight. The
lower the gravity, the lesser the weight and the
greater the height of the mountain. It is no accident
that Maxwell Mons on Venus and the Hawaiian
shield volcanoes on Earth rise to about the same
height (about 10 kilometers) above their respective
bases - Earth and Venus have similar surface
gravity. Mars's surface gravity is only 40 percent
that of Earth, so volcanoes rise roughly 2.5 times
as high. Are the Martian shield volcanoes still
active? Scientists have no direct evidence for
recent or ongoing eruptions, but if these volcanoes
were active as recently as 100 million years ago
(an estimate of the time of last eruption based on
the extent of impact cratering on their slopes),
some of them may still be at least intermittently
active. Millions of years, though, may pass between
eruptions.
Another prominent feature of Mars's surface is
cratering. The Mariner spacecraft found that the
surface of Mars, as well as that of its two moons, is
pitted with impact craters formed by meteoroids
falling in from space. As on our Moon, the smaller
craters are often filled with surface matter - mostly
dust - confirming that Mars is a dry desert world.
However, Martian craters get filled in considerably
faster than their lunar counterparts. On the Moon,
ancient craters less than 100 meters across
(corresponding to depths of about 20 meters) have
been obliterated, primarily by meteoritic erosion.
On Mars, there are relatively few craters less than
5 kilometers in diameter. The Martian atmosphere
is an efficient erosive agent, with Martian winds
transporting dust from place to place and erasing
surface features much faster than meteoritic
impacts alone can obliterate them.
As on the Moon, the extent of large impact
cratering (i.e. craters too big to have been filled in
by erosion since they were formed) serves as an
age indicator for the Martian surface. Age
estimates ranging from four billion years for Mars's
southern highlands to a few hundred million years
in the youngest volcanic areas were obtained in
this way.
The detailed appearance of Martian impact craters
provides an important piece of information about
conditions just below the planet's surface. Martian
craters are surrounded by ejecta (debris formed as
a result of an impact) that looks quite different from
its lunar counterparts. A comparison of the
Copernicus crater on the Moon with the (fairly
typical) crater Yuty on Mars demonstrates the
differences. The ejecta surrounding the lunar crater
is just what one would expect from an explosion
ejecting a large volume of dust, soil, and boulders.
However, the ejecta on Mars gives the distinct
impression of a liquid that has splashed or flowed
out of crater. Geologists think that this fluidized
ejecta crater indicates that a layer of permafrost, or
water ice, lies just a few meters under the surface.
Explosive impacts heated and liquefied the ice,
resulting in the fluid appearance of the ejecta.

72 – 2 The Impact Origin of Lunar Craters
From their discovery in 1609 until recently, lunar
craters were almost unanimously thought to have
volcanic origins, even though the topography of the
Moon and its craters had been studied minutely by
generations of observers. Dissenting voices, such
as that of Robert Hooke, who postulated in 1665
that they were formed by the impact of meteors, did
little to sway the majority opinion. The most serious
challenge to the volcanic-formation hypothesis was
made in 1893 by the geologist G. K. Gilbert. After
analyzing the depth-to-diameter ratios of craters,
Gilbert suggested that the craters could have been
formed only by the impact of meteors. The central
peaks that were commonly observed resulted from
rebound of rock, in a similar manner to liquids
(think of drops of water hitting a puddle). Bright
rays surrounded many craters that were formed
from material flung out during the impact---impact
ejecta.
Although impacts with a surface can occur at all
angles, from less than 5° to 90°, early experiments
suggested that only vertical (90°) impacts were
capable of producing circular craters. So the main
argument against an impact mechanism for lunar
crater formation was that only circular craters could
be seen on the Moon. However, Gilbert himself
showed that the average impact angle was 45° —
in fact, very few impacts were close to vertical.
In 1916 E J. Öpik published work that recognized
that the impact of meteors at very high velocities
would be fundamentally different from the impact at
low velocities created in early laboratory
experiments. Such high-velocity impacts would
have a similar effect to an explosion and craters
would be circular even at low impact angles.
Nevertheless, the volcanic hypothesis remained
intact, and there was significant unwillingness
amongst the scientific community about accepting
impact cratering. This began to change in the
1960s with the work of the American geologist
Gene Shoemaker, who made a lifetime study of
cratering.
Of the 170 known impact craters on the Earth,
Meteor Crater in Arizona was one of the first to be
recognized as being formed from an impact. In
1906 D. M. Barringer had provided good evidence
for impact formation. However, Meteor Crater was
not universally accepted as an impact crater until
the 1960s. lts impact origin was finally
demonstrated in papers published in 1960 and1963
by Shoemaker. Three lines of evidence show that
an impact, and not a volcanic eruption, formed
Meteor Crater.
First, as Barringer had recognized, many large
fragments from an impact have been found on the
desert plains surrounding Meteor Crater. Impact
structures that are larger than Meteor Crater do not
usually preserve fragments of the original
projectiles because they vaporize on impact.
In addition, most volcanic craters are formed by
sustained compression of volcanic gases which
blast out large volumes of fragments. Volcanic
ejecta form simple aprons around craters, the firsterupted materials at the bottom and the last at the
top. Shoemakers field studies showed that a
completely different situation exists at Meteor
Crater, where the ejecta form an inverted flap flung
out and overturned in a single blast. Thus, a drill
hole through the ejecta on the rim would pass
through layers of the same material twice. In
Shoemaker’s words, the strata appeared to “have
been peeled back from the area of the crater,
somewhat like petals of a flower blossoming.
Similar structures are observed in laboratory
experiments involving hypervelocity impacts.
The final piece of evidence comes from an
investigation of the effects of the intense pressures
involved in an impact. At Meteor Crater, shattered
target rocks are cemented together by glass at
depths of 200-400 meters. The glass is formed by
melting of the target during the impact. Melting
occurs principally as a result of the very high
pressures involved during an impact, and because
the pressure is applied almost instantaneously, it is
referred to as shock pressure. Unusual high
pressure minerals are often found in the rocks
affected by impact. These minerals are produced
by shock pressure during the impact.
In 1962 Shoemaker made a case for the impact
formation of Copernicus Crater, one of the most
prominent craters on the near side of the Moon.
Before the decade was out, most scientists had
come to accept that lunar craters were formed by
impact rather than volcanism.

73 – 3 Stellar Remnants
Eventually,all stars consume their nuclear fuel and
collapse into one of three final states-white
dwarf,neutron star,or black hole.
White dwarfs are extremely small stars with
densities greater than any known terrestrial
material.It is believed that white dwarfs began life
as low-mass or medium-mass stars.As the star
ages,it begins to collapse-become a "dwarfbecause it no longer produces sufficient radiant
heat to counteract the contracting force of its
gravity.Although some white dwarfs are no larger
than Earth,the mass of such a dwarf can equal 1.4
times that of the Sun.A spoonful of such matter
would weigh several tons.As a star contracts into a
white dwarf, its surface becomes very hot and very
bright.But,without a continuing source of energy,it
will slowly become cooler and dimmer.Although
none have been observed,the terminal stage of a
white dwarf must be a small,cold, nonluminous
body called a black dwarf.
A study of white dwarts produced what might at first
appear to be a surprising conclusion:the smallest
white dwarfs are the most massive,and the largest
white dwarfs are the least massive.The explanation
for this is that a more massive star has a greater
gravitational force,and that greater gravitational
force contracts the star into a smaller,more densely
packed object than one gets with a less massive
star.Thus,the smallest white dwarfs came from the
collapse of stars that were larger and more
massive than those the large white dwarfs came
from.
Extending this idea of larger stars collapsing to
smaller stars leads to the prediction that very large
stars would collapse to stars even smaller and
more massive than white dwarfs.Named neutron
stars,these objects are thought to be the remnants
of supernova events (the collapse of a large,very
massive star).If Earth were to collapse to the
density of a neutron star,it would have a diameter
equivalent to the length of a football field,and a
pea-sized sample of this matter would weigh 100
million tons.This is approximately the density of an
atomic nucleus;thus,neutron stars can be thought
of as large atomic nuclei.
Although neutron stars have high surface
temperatures,their small size would greatly limit
their luminosity.Consequently,locating one visually
would be extremely difficult.However,theory
predicts that a neutron star would have a very
strong magnetic field.Further,as a star collapses,it
will rotate faster,for the same reason ice-skaters
rotate faster as they pull in their arms.If the Sun
were to collapse to the size of a neutron star,it
would increase its rate of rotation from once every
25 days to nearly 1,000 times per second.The radio
waves generated by such rotating stars would be
concentrated into two narrow beams, like the
rotating light on a police car or ambulance.If Earth
happened to be in the path of this beacon,the star
would appear to blink on and off,or pulsate,as the
radio waves swept past.
In the early 1970s,a source that radiates short
pulses of radio energy,called a pulsar (pulsating
radio source),was discovered in the Crab
Nebula.Visual inspection of this radio source
revealed it to be a small star centered in the
nebula.The first neutron star had been
discovered.Are neutron stars made of the densest
matter possible?No.During a supernova
event,remnants of stars greater than three solar
masses apparently collapse into objects even
smaller and denser than neutron stars.Even though
these objects would be very hot, their gravity would
be so immense that even light could not escape the
surface. Consequently,they would literally
disappear from sight.These incredible bodies have
appropriately been named "black holes.Anything
that moved too near a black hole would be swept in
by its irresistible gravity and annihilated.
How can astronomers find an object whose
gravitational field prevents the escape of all matter
and energy? Theory predicts that as matter is
pulled into a black hole, it should become very hot
and emit a flood of x-rays before being engulfed.
The first black hole x-ray sources were discovered
in 1971 by detectors on satellites.
73
74 – 3 Lunar History
Much is still unknown about the Moon's origin.Until
recently,the most widely held hypothesis argued
that the formation of the Moon paralleled that of
Earth and the other planets.That is,the Moon
formed from minute rock fragments and gases that
composed a disk-shaped structure (the solar
nebula)that orbited the early Sun. Debris from this
disk collided and accumulated into larger masses
that,in turn, accreted into planetary-sized bodies.
A new hypothesis,which has recently gained
support from many scientists, suggests that a giant
body collided with Earth to produce the Moon.The
explosion caused by the impact of a Mars-sized
body with a semi-molten Earth is thought to have
ejected huge quantities of mantle rock from the
primordial Earth.A portion of this ejected material
remained in orbit around Earth,while the remainder
either escaped or impacted upon Earth's surface.In
a manner similar to that proposed in the earlier
hypothesis,the material orbiting Earth then began
to accumulate, eventually producing the
Moon.Though the giant impact hypothesis provides
a plausible mechanism for the Moon's
formation,many questions must be answered
before this proposal can be considered viable.
Despite the fact that the origin of the Moon is still
debated,planetary geologists have been able to
work out some of the basic details of the Moon's
history,using among other things variations in
crater density (quantity per unit area).Simply
stated,the higher the crater density,the longer the
topographic feature has existed. During its early
history,the Moon was continually impacted as it
swept up debris from the solar nebula.This
continuous bombardment and perhaps radioactive
decay generated enough heat to melt the Moon's
outer shell and quite possibly the rest of the Moon
as well.
When a large percentage of the debris had been
gathered,the outer layer of the Moon began to cool
and form a crystalline crust. From samples
obtained by Apollo astronauts, the rocks of the
primitive lunar crust are thought to be composed of
a high percentage of a calcium-rich feldspar
(anorthosite).This feldspar mineral crystallized early
and,because it was less dense than the remaining
melt,floated to the top and formed a surface
scum.While this process was taking place, iron and
other heavy metals probably sank to form a small
central core.Even after the crust had solidified, its
surface was continually bombarded. Remnants of
the original crust occupy the densely cratered
highlands,which have been estimated to be as
much as 4.5 billion years old.
The last period of heavy bombardment recorded in
the lunar highlands occurred almost 500 million
years after the crust had formed.It is not known
with certainty whether this final episode of
bombardment was simply a clean-up phase where
the remaining large particles in the Earth-Moon
orbit were swept up or whether it was an influx of
bodies from farther out in the solar system.
The next major event in the Moon's evolution was
the formation of maria basins, which are large
craters that filled with lava flowing up through
cracks in the Moon's surface. The meteoroids that
produced these huge pits ejected mountainous
quantities of lunar rock into piles rising 5 kilometers
or more.The Apennine mountain range, which
typifies such an accumulation,was produced in
conjunction with the formation of the Imbrium
Basin,the site explored by the Apollo 15 astronauts.
The crater density of the ejected material is greater
than that of the surface of the associated
basin,confirming that an appreciable time elapsed
between the formation and filling of these
basins.Radiometric dating of the maria basalts (a
type of rock)puts their age between 3.2 and 3.8
billion years,somewhat younger than the initial
crust. In places,the lava flows overlap the
highlands,another testimonial to the lesser age of
the maria deposits.
The last prominent features to form on the lunar
surface were the rayed craters as exemplified by
the crater Copernicus.Rays of material ejected from
these young"depressions are clearly seen
blanketing the surface of the maria and many older
rayless craters.By contrast,the older craters have
rounded rims,and their rays have been erased by
the impact of small debris.However,even a
relatively young crater like Copernicus must be
millions of years old.Had it formed on Earth,
erosional forces would have long since obliterated
it.
74
42 – 3 Callisto and Ganymede
From 1996 to 1999, the Galileo spacecraft passed
through the Jovian system, providing much
information about Jupiter's satellites. Callisto, the
outermost of Jupiter's four largest satellites, orbits
the planet in seventeen days at a distance from
Jupiter of two million kilometers. Like our own
Moon. Callisto rotates in the same period as it
revolves, so it always keeps the same face toward
Jupiter. Its noontime surface temperature is only
about -140°C, so water ice is stable on its surface
year-round. Callisto has a diameter of 4.820
kilometers, almost the same as that of Mercury. Its
mass is only one-third as great, which means its
density must be only one-third as great as well.
This tells us that Callisto has far less of the rocky
metallic materials found in the inner planets and
must instead be an icy body through much of its
interior.
Callisto has not fully differentiated, meaning
separated into layers of different density materials.
Astronomers can tell that it lacks a dense core from
the details of its gravitational pull on the Galileo
spacecraft during several very close flybys. This
fact surprised scientists, who expected that all the
big icy moons would be differentiated. It is much
easier for an icy body to differentiate than for a
rocky one, since the melting temperature of ice is
so low. Only a little heating will soften the ice and
get the process started, allowing the rock and
metal to sink to the center and the slushy ice to
float to the surface. Yet Callisto seems to have
frozen solid before the process of differentiation
was complete.
Like our Moon's highlands, the surface of Callisto is
covered with impact craters. The survival of these
craters tells us that an icy object can form and
retain impact craters in its surface. In thinking of ice
so far from the Sun, it is important not to judge its
behavior from that of the much warmer ice we
know on Earth; at the temperatures of the outer
solar system, ice on the surface is nearly as hard
as rock, and behaves similarly. Ice on Callisto does
not deform or flow like ice in glaciers on Earth.
Callisto is unique among the planet-sized objects of
the solar system in its absence of interior forces to
drive geological evolution. The satellite was born
dead and has remained geologically dead for more
than four billion years.
Ganymede, another of Jupiter's satellites and the
largest in our solar system, is also cratered, but
less so than Callisto. About one-quarter of its
surface seems to be as old and heavily cratered;
the rest formed more recently, as we can tell by the
sparse covering of impact craters as well as the
relative freshness of the craters. Ganymede is a
differentiated world, like the terrestrial planets.
Measurements of its gravity field tell us that the
rock and metal sank to form a core about the size
of our Moon, with a mantle and crust of ice floating
above it. In addition, the Galileo spacecraft
discovered that Ganymede has a magnetic field,
the signature of a partially molten interior.
Ganymede is not a dead world, but rather a place
of continuing geological activity powered by an
internal heat source. Much of its surface may be as
young as half a billion years.
The younger terrain is the result of tectonic and
volcanic forces.Some features formed when the
crust cracked, flooding many of the craters with
water from the interior. Extensive mountain ranges
were formed from compression of the crust,
forming long ridges with parallel valleys spaced
one to two kilometers apart. In some places older
impact craters were split and pulled apart. There
are even indications of large-scale crustal
movements that are similar to the plate tectonics of
Earth.
Why is Ganymede different from Callisto? Possibly
the small difference in size and internal heating
between the two led to this divergence in their
evolution. But more likely the gravity of Jupiter is to
blame for Ganymede's continuing geological
activity. Ganymede is close enough to Jupiter that
tidal forces from the giant planet may have
episodically heated its interior and triggered major
convulsions on its crust.
75
41 – 2 Climate of Venus
Earth has abundant water in its oceans but very
little carbon dioxide in its relatively thin atmosphere.
By contrast, Venus is very dry and its thick
atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide. The original
atmospheres of both Venus and Earth were
derived at least in part from gases spewed forth, or
outgassed, by volcanoes. The gases that emanate
from present-day volcanoes on Earth, such as
Mount Saint Helens, are predominantly water
vapor, carbon dioxide, and sulfur dioxide. These
gases should therefore have been important parts
of the original atmospheres of both Venus and
Earth. Much of the water on both planets is also
thought to have come from impacts from comets,
icy bodies formed in the outer solar system.
In fact, water probably once dominated the
Venusian atmosphere. Venus and Earth are similar
in size and mass, so Venusian volcanoes may well
have outgassed as much water vapor as on Earth,
and both planets would have had about the same
number of comets strike their surfaces. Studies of
how stars evolve suggest that the early Sun was
only about 70 percent as luminous as it is now, so
the temperature in Venus’ early atmosphere must
have been quite a bit lower. Thus water vapor
would have been able to liquefy and form oceans
on Venus. But if water vapor and carbon dioxide
were once so common in the atmospheres of both
Earth and Venus, what became of Earth’s carbon
dioxide? And what happened to the water on
Venus?
The answer to the first question is that carbon
dioxide is still found in abundance on Earth, but
now, instead of being in the form of atmospheric
carbon dioxide, it is either dissolved in the oceans
or chemically bound into carbonate rocks, such as
the limestone and marble that formed in the
oceans. If Earth became as hot as Venus, much of
its carbon dioxide would be boiled out of the
oceans and baked out of the crust. Our planet
would soon develop a thick, oppressive carbon
dioxide atmosphere much like that of Venus.
To answer the question about Venus’ lack of water,
we must return to the early history of the planet.
Just as on present-day Earth, the oceans of Venus
limited the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide
by dissolving it in the oceans and binding it up in
carbonate rocks. But being closer to the Sun than
Earth is, enough of the liquid water on Venus would
have vaporized to create a thick cover of water
vapor clouds. Since water vapor is a greenhouse
gas, this humid atmosphere—perhaps denser than
Earth’s present-day atmosphere, but far less dense
than the atmosphere that envelops Venus today—
would have efficiently trapped heat from the Sun.
At first, this would have had little effect on the
oceans of Venus. Although the temperature would
have climbed above 100° C, the boiling point of
water at sea level on Earth, the added atmospheric
pressure from water vapor would have kept the
water in Venus’ oceans in the liquid state.
This hot and humid state of affairs may have
persisted for several hundred million years. But as
the Sun’s energy output slowly increased over time,
the temperature at the surface would eventually
have risen above 374°C. Above this temperature,
no matter what the atmospheric pressure. Venus’
oceans would have begun to evaporate, and the
added water vapor in the atmosphere would have
increased the greenhouse effect. This would have
made the temperature even higher and caused the
oceans to evaporate faster, producing more water
vapor. That, in turn, would have further intensified
the greenhouse effect and made the temperature
climb higher still.
Once Venus’ oceans disappeared, so did the
mechanism for removing carbon dioxide from the
atmosphere. With no oceans to dissolve it,
outgassed carbon dioxide began to accumulate in
the atmosphere, intensifying the greenhouse effect
even more Temperatures eventually became high
enough to" bake out” any carbon dioxide that was
trapped in carbonate rocks. This liberated carbon
dioxide formed the thick atmosphere of present-day
Venus. Over time, the rising temperatures would
have leveled off, solar ultraviolet radiation having
broken down atmospheric water vapor molecules
into hydrogen and oxygen. With all the water vapor
gone, the greenhouse effect would no longer have
accelerated.
76
16 – 3 Planets in Our Solar System
The Sun is the hub of a huge rotating system
consisting of nine planets, their satellites, and
numerous small bodies, including asteroids,
comets, and meteoroids. An estimated 99.85
percent of the mass of our solar system is
contained within the Sun, while the planets
collectively make up most of the remaining 0.15
percent. The planets, in order of their distance from
the Sun, are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter,
Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. Under the
control of the Sun's gravitational force, each planet
maintains an elliptical orbit and all of them travel in
the same direction.
The planets in our solar system fall into two groups:
the terrestrial (Earth-like) planets (Mercury, Venus,
Earth, and Mars) and the Jovian (Jupiter-like)
planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune).
Pluto is not included in either category, because its
great distance from Earth and its small size make
this planet's true nature a mystery.
The most obvious difference between the terrestrial
and the Jovian planets is their size. The largest
terrestrial planet, Earth has a diameter only one
quarter as great as the diameter of the smallest
Jovian planet, Neptune, and its mass is only one
seventeenth as great. Hence, the Jovian planets
are often called giants. Also, because of their
relative locations, the four Jovian planets are
known as the outer planets, while the terrestrial
planets are known as the inner planets. There
appears to be a correlation between the positions
of these planets and their sizes.
Other dimensions along which the two groups differ
markedly are density and composition. The
densities of the terrestrial planets average about 5
times the density of water, whereas the Jovian
planets have densities that average only 1.5 times
the density of water. One of the outer planets,
Saturn, has a density of only 0.7 that of water,
which means that Saturn would float in water.
Variations in the composition of the planets are
largely responsible for the density differences. The
substances that make up both groups of planets
are divided into three groups—gases, rocks, and
ices—based on their melting points. The terrestrial
planets are mostly rocks: dense rocky and metallic
material, with minor amounts of gases. The Jovian
planets, on the other hand, contain a large
percentage of the gases hydrogen and helium, with
varying amounts of ices: mostly water, ammonia,
and methane ices.
The Jovian planets have very thick atmospheres
consisting of varying amounts of hydrogen, helium,
methane, and ammonia. By comparison, the
terrestrial planets have meager atmospheres at
best. A planet's ability to retain an atmosphere
depends on its temperature and mass. Simply
stated, a gas molecule can "evaporate" from a
planet if it reaches a speed known as the escape
velocity. For Earth, this velocity is 11 kilometers per
second. Any material, including a rocket, must
reach this speed before it can leave Earth and go
into space. The Jovian planets, because of their
greater masses and thus higher surface gravities,
have higher escape velocities (21-60 kilometers per
second) than the terrestrial planets. Consequently,
it is more difficult for gases to "evaporate" from
them. Also, because the molecular motion of a gas
depends on temperature, at the low temperatures
of the Jovian planets even the lightest gases are
unlikely to acquire the speed needed to escape. On
the other hand, a comparatively warm body with a
small surface gravity, like Earth's moon, is unable
to hold even the heaviest gas and thus lacks an
atmosphere. The slightly larger terrestrial planets
Earth, Venus, and Mars retain some heavy gases
like carbon dioxide, but even their atmospheres
make up only an infinitesimally small portion of their
total mass.
The orderly nature of our solar system leads most
astronomers to conclude that the planets formed at
essentially the same time and from the same
material as the Sun. It is hypothesized that the
primordial cloud of dust and gas from which all the
planets are thought to have condensed had a
composition somewhat similar to that of Jupiter.
However, unlike Jupiter, the terrestrial planets
today are nearly void of light gases and ices. The
explanation may be that the terrestrial planets were
once much larger and richer in these materials but
eventually lost them because of these bodies'
relative closeness to the Sun, which meant that
their temperatures were relatively high.
77
50 – 3 Star Death
Until the early- to mid-twentieth century, scientists
believed that stars generate energy by shrinking.
As stars contracted, it was thought, they would get
hotter and hotter, giving off light in the process.
This could not be the primary way that stars shine,
however. If it were, they would scarcely last a
million years, rather than the billions of years in age
that we know they are. We now know that stars are
fueled by nuclear fusion. Each time fusion takes
place, energy is released as a by-product. This
energy, expelled into space, is what we see as
starlight. The fusion process begins when two
hydrogen nuclei smash together to form a particle
called the deuteron (a combination of a positive
proton and a neutral neutron). Deuterons readily
combine with additional protons to form helium.
Helium, in turn, can fuse together to form heavier
elements, such as carbon. In a typical star, merger
after merger takes place until significant quantities
of heavy elements are built up.
We must distinguish, at this point, between two
different stellar types: Population I and Population
II, the latter being much older than the former.
These groups can also be distinguished by their
locations. Our galaxy, the Milky Way, is shaped like
a flat disk surrounding a central bulge. Whereas
Population I stars are found mainly in the galactic
disk, Population II stars mostly reside in the central
bulge of the galaxy and in the halo surrounding this
bulge.
Population II stars date to the early stages of the
universe. Formed when the cosmos was filled with
hydrogen and helium gases, they initially contained
virtually no heavy elements. They shine until their
fusible material is exhausted. When Population II
stars die, their material is spread out into space.
Some of this dust is eventually incorporated into
newly formed Population I stars. Though
Population I stars consist mostly of hydrogen and
helium gas, they also contain heavy elements
(heavier than helium), which comprise about 1 or 2
percent of their mass. These heavier materials are
fused from the lighter elements that the stars have
collected. Thus, Population I stars contain material
that once belonged to stars from previous
generations. The Sun is a good example of a
Population I star.
What will happen when the Sun dies? In several
billion years, our mother star will burn much
brighter. It will expend more and more of its nuclear
fuel, until little is left of its original hydrogen. Then,
at some point in the far future, all nuclear reactions
in the Sun's center will cease.
Once the Sun passes into its "postnuclear" phase,
it will separate effectively into two different regions:
an inner zone and an outer zone. While no more
hydrogen fuel will remain in the inner zone, there
will be a small amount left in the outer zone.
Rapidly, changes will begin to take place that will
serve to tear the Sun apart. The inner zone, its
nuclear fires no longer burning, will begin to
collapse under the influence of its own weight and
will contract into a tiny hot core, dense and dim. An
opposite fate will await the outer region, a loosely
held-together ball of gas. A shock wave caused by
the inner zone's contraction will send ripples
through the dying star, pushing the stellar exterior's
material farther and farther outward. The outer
envelope will then grow rapidly, increasing, in a
short interval, hundreds of times in size. As it
expands, it will cool down by thousands of degrees.
Eventually, the Sun will become a red giant star,
cool and bright. It will be so large that it will occupy
the whole space that used to be the Earth's orbit
and so brilliant that it would be able to be seen with
the naked eye thousands of light-years away. It will
exist that way for millions of years, gradually
releasing the material of its outer envelope into
space. Finally, nothing will be left of the gaseous
exterior of the Sun; all that will remain will be the
hot, white core. The Sun will have become a white
dwarf star. The core will shrink, giving off the last of
its energy, and the Sun will finally die.

51 – 2 Surface Fluids on Venus and Earth
A fluid is a substance, such as a liquid or gas, in
which the component particles (usually molecules)
can move past one another. Fluids flow easily and
conform to the shape of their containers. The
geologic processes related to the movement of
fluids on a planet's surface can completely
resurface a planet many times. These processes
derive their energy from the Sun and the
gravitational forces of the planet itself. As these
fluids interact with surface materials, they move
particles about or react chemically with them to
modify or produce materials. On a solid planet with
a hydrosphere and an atmosphere, only a tiny
fraction of the planetary mass flows as surface
fluids. Yet the movements of these fluids can
drastically alter a planet. Consider Venus and
Earth, both terrestrial planets with atmospheres.
Venus and Earth are commonly regarded as twin
planets but not identical twins. They are about the
same size, are composed of roughly the same mix
of materials, and may have been comparably
endowed at their beginning with carbon dioxide and
water. However, the twins evolved differently
largely because of differences in their distance from
the Sun. With a significant amount of internal heat,
Venus may continue to be geologically active with
volcanoes, rifting, and folding. However, it lacks
any sign of a hydrologic system (water circulation
and distribution): there are no streams, lakes
oceans or glaciers. Space probes suggest that
Venus may have started with as much water as
Earth, but it was unable to keep its water in liquid
form. Because Venus receives more heat from the
Sun, water released from the interior evaporated
and rose to the upper atmosphere where the Sun's
ultraviolet rays broke the molecules apart. Much of
the freed hydrogen escaped into space, and Venus
lost its water. Without water, Venus became less
and less like Earth and kept an atmosphere filled
with carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide acts as a
blanket, creating an intense greenhouse effect and
driving surface temperatures high enough to melt
lead and to prohibit the formation of carbonate
minerals. Volcanoes continually vented more
carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. On Earth,
liquid water removes carbon dioxide from the
atmosphere and combines it with calcium, from
rock weathering, to form carbonate sedimentary
rocks. Without liquid water to remove carbon from
the atmosphere, the level of carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere of Venus remains high.
Like Venus, Earth is large enough to be
geologically active and for its gravitational field to
hold an atmosphere. Unlike Venus, it is just the
right distance from the Sun so that temperature
ranges allow water to exist as a liquid, a solid, and
a gas. Water is thus extremely mobile and moves
rapidly over the planet in a continuous hydrologic
cycle. Heated by the Sun, the water moves in great
cycles from the oceans to the atmosphere, over the
landscape in river systems, and ultimately back to
the oceans. As a result, Earth's surface has been
continually changed and eroded into delicate
systems of river valleys-a remarkable contrast to
the surfaces of other planetary bodies where
impact craters dominate. Few areas on Earth have
been untouched by flowing water. As a result, river
valleys are the dominant feature of its landscape.
Similarly, wind action has scoured fine particles
away from large areas, depositing them elsewhere
as vast sand seas dominated by dunes or in sheets
of loess (fine-grained soil deposits). These fluid
movements are caused by gravity flow systems
energized by heat from the Sun. Other geologic
changes occur when the gases in the atmosphere
or water react with rocks at the surface to form new
chemical compounds with different properties. An
important example of this process was the removal
of most of Earths carbon dioxide from its
atmosphere to form carbonate rocks. However, if
Earth were a little closer to the Sun, its oceans
would evaporate; if it were farther from the Sun, the
oceans would freeze solid. Because liquid water
was present, self-replicating molecules of carbon,
hydrogen, and oxygen developed life early in
Earth's history and have radically modified its
surface, blanketing huge parts of the continents
with greenery. Life thrives on this planet, and it
helped create the planet's oxygen- and nitrogenrich atmosphere and moderate temperatures.

HYDROGRAPHY / HYDROGEOLOGY
05 – 1 Minerals and Plants
Research has shown that certain minerals are
required by plants for normal growth and
development. The soil is the source of these minerals,
which are absorbed by the plant with the water from
the soil. Even nitrogen, which is a gas in its elemental
state, is normally absorbed from the soil as nitrate
ions. Some soils are notoriously deficient in micro
nutrients and are therefore unable to support most
plant life. So-called serpentine soils, for example, are
deficient in calcium, and only plants able to tolerate
low levels of this mineral can survive. In modern
agriculture, mineral depletion of soils is a major
concern, since harvesting crops interrupts the
recycling of nutrients back to the soil.
Mineral deficiencies can often be detected by specific
symptoms such as chlorosis (loss of chlorophyll
resulting in yellow or white leaf tissue), necrosis
(isolated dead patches), anthocyanin formation
(development of deep red pigmentation of leaves or
stem), stunted growth, and development of woody
tissue in an herbaceous plant. Soils are most
commonly deficient in nitrogen and phosphorus.
Nitrogen-deficient plants exhibit many of the
symptoms just described. Leaves develop chlorosis;
stems are short and slender, and anthocyanin
discoloration occurs on stems, petioles, and lower
leaf surfaces. Phosphorus-deficient plants are often
stunted, with leaves turning a characteristic dark
green, often with the accumulation of anthocyanin.
Typically, older leaves are affected first as the
phosphorus is mobilized to young growing tissue. Iron
deficiency is characterized by chlorosis between
veins in young leaves.
Much of the research on nutrient deficiencies is based
on growing plants hydroponically, that is, in soilless
liquid nutrient solutions. This technique allows
researchers to create solutions that selectively omit
certain nutrients and then observe the resulting
effects on the plants. Hydroponics has applications
beyond basic research, since it facilitates the growing
of greenhouse vegetables during winter. Aeroponics,
a technique in which plants are suspended and the
roots misted with a nutrient solution, is another
method for growing plants without soil.
While mineral deficiencies can limit the growth of
plants, an over abundance of certain minerals can be
toxic and can also limit growth. Saline soils, which
have high concentrations of sodium chloride and
other salts, limit plant growth, and research continues
to focus on developing salt-tolerant varieties of
agricultural crops. Research has focused on the toxic
effects of heavy metals such as lead, cadmium,
mercury, and aluminum; however, even copper and
zinc, which are essential elements, can become toxic
in high concentrations. Although most plants cannot
survive in these soils, certain plants have the ability to
tolerate high levels of these minerals.
Scientists have known for some time that certain
plants, called hyper accumulators, can concentrate
minerals at levels a hundredfold or greater than
normal. A survey of known hyper accumulators
identified that 75 percent of them amassed nickel,
cobalt, copper, zinc, manganese, lead, and cadmium
are other minerals of choice. Hyper accumulators run
the entire range of the plant world. They may be
herbs, shrubs, or trees. Many members of the
mustard family, spurge family, legume family, and
grass family are top hyper accumulators. Many are
found in tropical and subtropical areas of the world,
where accumulation of high concentrations of metals
may afford some protection against plant-eating
insects and microbial pathogens.
Only recently have investigators considered using
these plants to clean up soil and waste sites that have
been contaminated by toxic levels of heavy metals-an
environmentally friendly approach known as
phytoremediation. This scenario begins with the
planting of hyper accumulating species in the target
area, such as an abandoned mine or an irrigation
pond contaminated by runoff. Toxic minerals would
first be absorbed by roots but later relocated to the
stem and leaves. A harvest of the shoots would
remove the toxic compounds off site to be burned or
composted to recover the metal for industrial uses.
After several years of cultivation and harvest, the site
would be restored at a cost much lower than the price
of excavation and reburial, the standard practice for
remediation of contaminated soils. For examples, in
field trials, the plant alpine penny cress removed zinc
and cadmium from soils near a zinc smelter, and
Indian mustard, native to Pakistan and India, has
been effective in reducing levels of selenium salts by
50 percent in contaminated soils.

09 – 3 The Arrival of Plant Life in Hawaii
When the Hawaiian Islands emerged from the sea
as volcanoes, starting about five million years ago,
they were far removed from other landmasses.
Then, as blazing sunshine alternated with
drenching rains, the harsh, barren surfaces of the
black rocks slowly began to soften. Winds brought
a variety of life-forms.
Spores light enough to float on the breezes were
carried thousands of miles from more ancient lands
and deposited at random across the bare mountain
flanks. A few of these spores found a toehold on
the dark, forbidding rocks and grew and began to
work their transformation upon the land. Lichens
were probably the first successful flora. These are
not single individual plants; each one is a symbiotic
combination of an alga and a fungus. The algae
capture the sun's energy by photosynthesis and
store it in organic molecules. The fungi absorb
moisture and mineral salts from the rocks, passing
these on in waste products that nourish algae. It is
significant that the earliest living things that built
communities on these islands are examples of
symbiosis, a phenomenon that depends upon the
close cooperation of two or more forms of life and a
principle that is very important in island
communities.
Lichens helped to speed the decomposition of the
hard rock surfaces, preparing a soft bed of soil that
was abundantly supplied with minerals that had
been carried in the molten rock from the bowels of
Earth. Now, other forms of life could take hold:
ferns and mosses (two of the most ancient types of
land plants) that flourish even in rock crevices.
These plants propagate by producing spores—tiny
fertilized cells that contain all the instructions for
making a new plant—but the spore are unprotected
by any outer coating and carry no supply of
nutrient. Vast numbers of them fall on the ground
beneath the mother plants. Sometimes they are
carried farther afield by water or by wind. But only
those few spores that settle down in very favorable
locations can start new life; the vast majority fall on
barren ground. By force of sheer numbers,
however, the mosses and ferns reached Hawaii,
survived, and multiplied. Some species developed
great size, becoming tree ferns that even now grow
in the Hawaiian forests.
Many millions of years after ferns evolved (but long
before the Hawaiian Islands were born from the
sea), another kind of flora evolved on Earth: the
seed-bearing plants. This was a wonderful
biological invention. The seed has an outer coating
that surrounds the genetic material of the new
plant, and inside this covering is a concentrated
supply of nutrients. Thus the seed’s chances of
survival are greatly enhanced over those of the
naked spore. One type of seed-bearing plant, the
angiosperm, includes all forms of blooming
vegetation. In the angiosperm the seeds are
wrapped in an additional layer of covering. Some of
these coats are hard—like the shell of a nut—for
extra protection. Some are soft and tempting, like a
peach or a cherry. In some angiosperms the seeds
are equipped with gossamer wings, like the
dandelion and milkweed seeds. These new
characteristics offered better ways for the seed to
move to new habitats. They could travel through
the air, float in water, and lie dormant for many
months.
Plants with large, buoyant seeds—like coconuts—
drift on ocean currents and are washed up on the
shores. Remarkably resistant to the vicissitudes of
ocean travel, they can survive prolonged immersion
in saltwater when they come to rest on warm
beaches and the conditions are favorable, the seed
coats soften. Nourished by their imported supply of
nutrients, the young plants push out their roots and
establish their place in the sun.
By means of these seeds, plants spread more
widely to new locations, even to isolated islands
like the Hawaiian archipelago, which lies more than
2,000 miles west of California and 3,500 miles east
of Japan. The seeds of grasses, flowers, and
blooming trees made the long trips to these
islands. (Grasses are simple forms of angiosperms
that bear their encapsulated seeds on long stalks.)
In a surprisingly short time, angiosperms filled
many of the land areas on Hawaii that had been
bare.

19 – 2 Succession, Climax, and Ecosystems
In the late nineteenth century, ecology began to
grow into an independent science from its roots in
natural history and plant geography. The emphasis
of this new “community ecology” was on the
composition and structure of communities
consisting of different species. In the early
twentieth century, the American ecologist Frederic
Clements pointed out that a succession of plant
communities would develop after a disturbance
such as a volcanic eruption, heavy flood, or forest
fire. An abandoned field, for instance, will be
invaded successively by herbaceous plants (plants
with little or no woody tissue), shrubs, and trees,
eventually becoming a forest. Light-loving species
are always among the first invaders, while shadetolerant species appear later in the succession.
Clements and other early ecologists saw almost
lawlike regularity in the order of succession, but
that has not been substantiated. A general trend
can be recognized, but the details are usually
unpredictable. Succession is influenced by many
factors: the nature of the soil, exposure to sun and
wind, regularity of precipitation, chance
colonizations, and many other random processes.
The final stage of a succession, called the climax
by Clements and early ecologists, is likewise not
predictable or of uniform composition. There is
usually a good deal of turnover in species
composition, even in a mature community. The
nature of the climax is influenced by the same
factors that influenced succession. Nevertheless,
mature natural environments are usually in
equilibrium. They change relatively little through
time unless the environment itself changes.
For Clements, the climax was a “superorganism”,
an organic entity. Even some authors who
accepted the climax concept rejected Clements’
characterization of it as a superorganism, and it is
indeed a misleading metaphor. An ant colony may
be legitimately called a superorganism because its
communication system is so highly organized that
the colony always works as a whole and
appropriately according to the circumstances. But
there is no evidence for such an interacting
communicative network in a climax plant formation.
Many authors prefer the term “association” to the
term “community” in order to stress the looseness
of the interaction.
Even less fortunate was the extension of this type
of thinking to include animals as well as plants.
This resulted in the “biome”, a combination of
coexisting flora and fauna. Though it is true that
many animals are strictly associated with certain
plants, it is misleading to speak of a “spruce-moose
biome”, for example, because there is no internal
cohesion to their association as in an organism.
The spruce community is not substantially affected
by either the presence or absence of moose.
Indeed, there are vast areas of spruce forest
without moose. The opposition to the Clementsian
concept of plant ecology was initiated by Herbert
Gleason, soon joined by various other ecologists.
Their major point was that the distribution of a
given species was controlled by the habitat
requirements of that species and that therefore the
vegetation types were a simple consequence of the
ecologies of individual plant species.
With “climax”, “biome”, “superorganism”, and
various other technical terms for the association of
animals and plants at a given locality being
criticized, the term “ecosystem” was more and
more widely adopted for the whole system of
associated organisms together with the physical
factors of their environment. Eventually, the
energy-transforming role of such a system was
emphasized. Ecosystems thus involve the
circulation, transformation, and accumulation of
energy and matter through the medium of living
things and their activities. The ecologist is
concerned primarily with the quantities of matter
and energy that pass through a given ecosystem,
and with the rates at which they do so.
Although the ecosystem concept was very popular
in the 1950s and 1960s, it is no longer the
dominant paradigm. Gleason’s arguments against
climax and biome are largely valid against
ecosystems as well. Furthermore, the number of
interactions is so great that they are difficult to
analyze, even with the help of large computers.
Finally, younger ecologists have found ecological
problems involving behavior and life-history
adaptations more attractive than measuring
physical constants. Nevertheless, one still speaks
of the ecosystem when referring to a local
association of animals and plants, usually without
paying much attention to the energy aspects.

22 – 1 Spartina
Spartina alterniflora, known as cordgrass, is a
deciduous, perennial flowering plant native to the
Atlantic coast and the Gulf Coast of the United
States. It is the dominant native species of the
lower salt marshes along these coasts, where it
grows in the intertidal zone (the area covered by
water some parts of the day and exposed others).
These natural salt marshes are among the most
productive habitats in the marine environment.
Nutrient-rich water is brought to the wetlands
during each high tide, making a high rate of food
production possible. As the seaweed and marsh
grass leaves die, bacteria break down the plant
material, and insects, small shrimplike organisms,
fiddler crabs, and marsh snails eat the decaying
plant tissue, digest it, and excrete wastes high in
nutrients. Numerous insects occupy the marsh,
feeding on living or dead cordgrass tissue, and
redwing blackbirds, sparrows, rodents, rabbits, and
deer feed directly on the cordgrass. Each tidal
cycle carries plant material into the offshore water
to be used by the subtidal organisms.
Spartina is an exceedingly competitive plant. It
spreads primarily by underground stems; colonies
form when pieces of the root system or whole
plants float into an area and take root or when
seeds float into a suitable area and germinate.
Spartina establishes itself on substrates ranging
from sand and silt to gravel and cobble and is
tolerant of salinities ranging from that of near
freshwater (0.05 percent) to that of salt water (3.5
percent). Because they lack oxygen, marsh
sediments are high in sulfides that are toxic to most
plants. Spartina has the ability to take up sulfides
and convert them to sulfate, a form of sulfur that
the plant can use; this ability makes it easier for the
grass to colonize marsh environments. Another
adaptive advantage is Spartina’s ability to use
carbon dioxide more efficiently than most other
plants.
These characteristics make Spartina a valuable
component of the estuaries where it occurs
naturally. The plant functions as a stabilizer and a
sediment trap and as a nursery area for estuarine
fish and shellfish. Once established, a stand of
Spartina begins to trap sediment, changing the
substrate elevation, and eventually the stand
evolves into a high marsh system where Spartina is
gradually displaced by higher-elevation, brackishwater species. As elevation increases, narrow,
deep channels of water form throughout the marsh.
Along the east coast Spartina is considered
valuable for its ability to prevent erosion and
marshland deterioration; it is also used for coastal
restoration projects and the creation of new
wetland sites.
Spartina was transported to Washington State in
packing materials for oysters transplanted from the
east coast in 1894. Leaving its insect predators
behind, the cordgrass has been spreading slowly
and steadily along Washington’s tidal estuaries on
the west coast, crowding out the native plants and
drastically altering the landscape by trapping
sediment. Spartina modifies tidal mudflats, turning
them into high marshes inhospitable to the many
fish and waterfowl that depend on the mudflats. It is
already hampering the oyster harvest and the
Dungeness crab fishery, and it interferes with the
recreational use of beaches and waterfronts.
Spartina has been transplanted to England and to
New Zealand for land reclamation and shoreline
stabilization. In New Zealand the plant has spread
rapidly, changing mudflats with marshy fringes to
extensive salt meadows and reducing the number
and kinds of birds and animals that use the marsh.
Efforts to control Spartina outside its natural
environment have included burning, flooding,
shading plants with black canvas or plastic,
smothering the plants with dredged materials or
clay, applying herbicide, and mowing repeatedly.
Little success has been reported in New Zealand
and England; Washington State’s management
program has tried many of these methods and is
presently using the herbicide glyphosphate to
control its spread. Work has begun to determine
the feasibility of using insects as biological controls,
but effective biological controls are considered
years away. Even with a massive effort, it is
doubtful that complete eradication of Spartina from
nonnative habitats is possible, for it has become an
integral part of these shorelines and estuaries
during the last 100 to 200 years.
83
25 – 3 The Evolutionary Origin of Plants
The evolutionary history of plants has been marked
by a series of adaptations. The ancestors of plants
were photosynthetic single-celled organisms that
gave rise to plants presumably lacked true roots,
stems, leaves, and complex reproductive structures
such as flowers. All of these features appeared
later in the evolutionary history of plants. Of today’s
different groups of algae, green algae are probably
the most similar to ancestral plants. This
supposition stems from the close phylogenetic
(natural evolutionary) relationship between the two
groups. DNA comparisons have shown that green
algae are plants’ closest living relatives. In addition,
other lines of evidence support the hypothesis that
land plants evolved from ancestral green algae
used the same type of chlorophyll and accessory
pigments in photosynthesis as do land plants. This
would not be true of red and brown algae. Green
algae store food as starch, as do land plants and
have cell walls made of cellulose, similar in
composition to those of land plants. Again, the
good storage and cell wall molecules of red and
brown algae are different.
Today green algae live mainly in freshwater,
suggesting that their early evolutionary history may
have occurred in freshwater habitats. If so, the
green algae would have been subjected to
environmental pressures that resulted in
adaptations that enhanced their potential to give
rise to land-dwelling or organisms.
The environmental conditions of freshwater
habitats, unlike those of ocean habitats, are highly
variable. Water temperature can fluctuate
seasonally or even daily and changing level of
rainfall can lead to fluctuations in the concentration
of chemical in the water or even to period in which
the aquatic habitat dries up. Ancient fresh water
green algae must have evolved features that
enable them to withstand extremes of temperature
and periods of dryness. These adaptations served
their descendant well as they invaded land.
The terrestrial world is green now, but it did not
start out that way. When plants first made the
transition ashore more than 400 million years ago,
the land was barren and desolate, inhospitable to
life. From a plant’s evolutionary view point,
however, it was also a land of opportunity, free of
competitors and predators and full of carbon
dioxide and sunlight (the raw materials for
photosynthesis, which are present in far higher
concentrations in air than in water).So once natural
selection had shaped the adaptations that helped
plants overcome the obstacles to terrestrial living,
plants prospered and diversified.
When plants pioneered the land, they faced a
range of challenges posed by terrestrial
environments. On land, the supportive buoyancy of
water is missing, the plant is no longer bathed in a
nutrient solution, and air tends to dry things out.
These conditions favored the evolution of the
structures that support the body, vessels that
transport water and nutrients to all parts of plant,
and structures that conserve water. The resulting
adaptations to dry land include some structural
features that arose early in plant evolution; now
these features are common to virtually all land
plant. They include roots or root like structures, a
waxy cuticle that covers the surfaces of leaves and
stems and limits the evaporation of water, and
pores called stomata in leaves and stems that allow
gas exchange but close when water is scarce, thus
reducing water loss. Other adaptations occurred
later in the transition to terrestrial life and now wide
spread but not universal among plants. These
include conducting vessels that transport water and
minerals upward from the roots and that move the
photosynthetic products from the leaves to the rest
of the plant body and the stiffening substance
lignin, which support the plant body, helping it
expose maximum surface area to sunlight.
These adaptations allowed an increasing diversity
of plant forms to exploit dry land. Life on land,
however, also required new methods of
transporting sperm to eggs. Unlike aquatic and
marine forms, land plants cannot always rely on
water currents to carry their sex cells and disperse
their fertilized eggs. So the most successful groups
of land plants are those that evolved methods of
fertilized sex cell dispersal that are independent of
water and structures that protect developing
embryos from drying out. Protected embryos and
waterless dispersal of sex cells were achieved with
the origin of seed plants and the key evolutionary
innovations that they introduced: pollen, seeds, and
later, flowers and fruits.
84
31 – 3 Savanna Formation
Located in tropical areas at low altitudes, savannas
are stable ecosystems, some wet and some dry
consisting of vast grasslands with scattered trees
and shrubs. They occur on a wide range of soil
types and in extremes of climate. There is no
simple or single factor that determines if a given
site will be a savanna, but some factors seem to
play important roles in their formation.
Savannas typically experience a rather prolonged
dry season. One theory behind savanna formation
is that wet forest species are unable to withstand
the dry season, and thus savanna, rather than rain
forest, is favored on the site. Savannas experience
an annual rainfall of between 1,000 and 2,000
millimeters, most of it falling in a five- to eightmonth wet season. Though plenty of rain may fall
on a savanna during the year, for at least part of
the year little does, creating the drought stress
ultimately favoring grasses. Such conditions prevail
throughout much of northern South America and
Cuba, but many Central American savannas as
well as coastal areas of Brazil and the island of
Trinidad do not fit this pattern. In these areas,
rainfall per month exceeds that in the above
definition, so other factors must contribute to
savanna formation.
In many characteristics, savanna soils are similar to
those of some rain forests, though more extreme.
For example, savanna soils, like many rain forest
soils, are typically oxisols (dominated by certain
oxide minerals) and ultisols (soils containing no
calcium carbonate), with a high acidity and notably
low concentrations of such minerals as
phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and potassium,
while aluminum levels are high. Some savannas
occur on wet, waterlogged soils; others on dry,
sandy, well-drained soils. This may seem
contradictory, but it only means that extreme soil
conditions, either too wet or too dry for forests, are
satisfactory for savannas. More moderate
conditions support moist forests.
Waterlogged soils occur in areas that are flat or
have poor drainage. These soils usually contain
large amounts of clay and easily become water
saturated. Air cannot penetrate between the soil
particles, making the soil oxygen-poor. By contrast,
dry soils are sandy and porous, their coarse
textures permitting water to drain rapidly. Sandy
soils are prone to the leaching of nutrients and
minerals and so tend to be nutritionally poor.
Though most savannas are found on sites with
poor soils (because of either moisture conditions or
nutrient levels of both), poor soils can and do
support lush rain forest.
Most savannas probably experience mild fires
frequently and major burns every two years or so.
Many savanna and dry-forest plant species are
called pyrophytes, meaning they are adapted in
various ways to withstand occasional burning.
Frequent fire is a factor to which rain forest species
seem unable to adapt, although ancient charcoal
remains from Amazon forest soils dating prior to
the arrival of humans suggest that moist forests
also occasionally burn. Experiments suggest that if
fire did not occur in savannas in the Americas,
species composition would change significantly.
When burning occurs, it prevents competition
among plant species from progressing to the point
where some species exclude others, reducing the
overall diversity of the ecosystem. But in
experimental areas protected from fire, a few
perennial grass species eventually come to
dominate, outcompeting all others. Evidence from
other studies suggests that exclusion of fire results
in markedly decreased plant-species richness,
often with an increase in tree density. There is
generally little doubt that fire is a significant factor
in maintaining savanna, certainly in most regions.
On certain sites, particularly in South America,
savanna formation seems related to frequent
cutting and burning of moist forests for pastureland.
Increase in pastureland and subsequent
overgrazing have resulted in an expansion of
savanna. The thin upper layer of humus (decayed
organic matter) is destroyed by cutting and burning.
Humus is necessary for rapid decomposition of
leaves by bacteria and fungi and for recycling by
surface roots. Once the humus layer disappears,
nutrients cannot be recycled and leach from the
soil, converting soil from fertile to infertile and
making it suitable only for savanna vegetation.
Forests on white, sandy soil are most susceptible
to permanent alteration.
85
32 – 1 Plant Colonization
Colonization is one way in which plants can change
the ecology of a site. Colonization is a process with
two components: invasion and survival. The rate at
which a site is colonized by plants depends on both
the rate at which individual organisms (seeds,
spores, immature or mature individuals) arrive at
the site and their success at becoming established
and surviving. Success in colonization depends to
a great extent on there being a site available for
colonization – a safe site where disturbance by
fire or by cutting down of trees has either removed
competing species or reduced levels of competition
and other negative interactions to a level at which
the invading species can become established. For
a given rate of invasion, colonization of a moist,
fertile site is likely to be much more rapid than that
of a dry, infertile site because of poor survival on
the latter. A fertile, plowed field is rapidly invaded
by a large variety of weeds, whereas a neighboring
construction site from which the soil has been
compacted or removed to expose a coarse, infertile
parent material may remain virtually free of
vegetation for many months or even years despite
receiving the same input of seeds as the plowed
field.
Both the rate of invasion and the rate of extinction
vary greatly among different plant species. Pioneer
species – those that occur only in the earliest
stages of colonization – tend to have high rates of
invasion because they produce very large numbers
of reproductive propagules (seeds, spores, and so
on) and because they have an efficient means of
dispersal (normally, wind).
If colonizers produce short-lived reproductive
propagules, then they must produce very large
numbers unless they have an efficient means of
dispersal to suitable new habitats. Many plants
depend on wind for dispersal and produce
abundant quantities of small, relatively short-lived
seeds to compensate for the fact that wind is not
always a reliable means of reaching the
appropriate type of habitat. Alternative strategies
have evolved in some plants, such as those that
produce fewer but larger seeds that are dispersed
to suitable sites by birds or small mammals or
those that produce long-lived seeds. Many forest
plants seem to exhibit the latter adaptation, and
viable seeds of pioneer species can be found in
large numbers on some forest floors. For example,
as many as 1,125 viable seeds per square meter
were found in a 100-year-old Douglas fir/western
hemlock forest in coastal British Columbia. Nearly
all the seeds that had germinated from this seed
bank were from pioneer species. The rapid
colonization of such sites after disturbance is
undoubtedly in part a reflection of the large seed
bank on the forest floor.
An adaptation that is well developed in colonizing
species is a high degree of variation in germination
(the beginning of a seed’s growth). Seeds of a
given species exhibit a wide range of germination
dates, increasing the probability that at least some
of the seeds will germinate during a period of
favorable environmental conditions. This is
particularly important for species that colonize an
environment where there is no existing vegetation
to ameliorate climatic extremes and in which there
may be great climatic diversity.
Species succession in plant communities, i.e., the
temporal sequence of appearance and
disappearance of species is dependent on events
occurring at different stages in the life history of a
species. Variation in rates of invasion and growth
plays an important role in determining patterns of
succession, especially secondary succession. The
species that are first to colonize a site are those
that produce abundant seeds that are distributed
successfully to new sites. Such species generally
grow rapidly and quickly dominate new sites,
excluding other species with lower invasion and
growth rates. The first community that occupies a
disturbed area therefore may be composed of
species with the highest rate of invasion, whereas
the community of the subsequent stage may
consist of plants with similar survival rates but
lower invasion rates.

34 – 3 Protection of Plants by Insects
Many plants – one or more species of at least 68
different families – can secrete nectar even when
they have no blossoms, because they bear
extrafloral nectaries (structures that produce
nectar) on stems, leaves, leaf stems, or other
structures. These plants usually occur where ants
are abundant, most in the tropics but some in
temperate areas. Among those of northeastern
North America are various plums, cherries, roses,
hawthorns, poplars, and oaks. Like floral nectar,
extrafloral nectar consists mainly of water with a
high content of dissolved sugars and, in some
plants, small amounts of amino acids. The
extrafloral nectaries of some plants are known to
attract ants and other insects, but the evolutionary
history of most plants with these nectaries is
unknown. Nevertheless, most ecologists believe
that all extrafloral nectaries attract insects that will
defend the plant.
Ants are portably the most frequent and certainly
the most persistent defenders of plants. Since the
highly active worker ants require a great deal of
energy, plants exploit this need by providing
extrafloral nectar that supplies ants with abundant
energy. To return this favor, ants guard the
nectaries, driving away or killing intruding insects
that might compete with ants for nectar. Many of
these intruders are herbivorous and would eat the
leaves of the plants.
Biologists once thought that secretion of extrafloral
nectar has some purely internal physiological
function, and that ants provide no benefit
whatsoever to the plants that secrete it. This view
and the opposing “protectionist” hypothesis that
ants defend plants had been disputed for over a
hundred years when, in 1910, a skeptical William
Morton Wheeler commented on the controversy.
He called for proof of the protectionist view: that
visitations of the ants confer protection on the
plants and that in the absence of the insects a
much greater number would perish or fail to
produce flowers or seeds than when the insects
are present. That we now have an abundance of
the proof that was called for was established when
Barbara Bentley reviewed the relevant evidence in
1977, and since then many more observations and
experiments have provided still further proof that
ants benefit plants.
One example shows how ants attracted to
extrafloral nectaries protect morning glories against
attacking insects. The principal insect enemies of
the North American morning glory feed mainly on
its flowers or fruits rather than its leaves.
Grasshoppers feeding on flowers indirectly block
pollination and the production of seeds by
destroying the corolla or the stigma, which receives
the pollen grains and on which the pollen
germinates. Without their colorful corolla, flowers
do not attract pollinators and are not fertilized. An
adult grasshopper can consume a large corolla,
about 2.5 inches long, in an hour. Caterpillars and
seed beetles affect seed production directly.
Caterpillars devour the ovaries, where the seeds
are produced, and seed beetle larvae eat seeds as
they burrow in developing fruits.
Extrafloral nectaries at the base of each sepal
attract several kinds of insects, but 96 percent of
them are ants, several different species of them.
When buds are still small, less than a quarter of an
inch long, the sepal nectaries are already present
and producing nectar. They continue to do so as
the flower develops and while the fruit matures.
Observations leave little doubt that ants protect
morning glory flowers and fruits from the combined
enemy force of grasshoppers, caterpillars, and
seed beetles. Bentley compares the seed
production of six plants that grew where there were
no ants with that of seventeen plants that were
occupied by ants. Unprotected plants bore only 45
seeds per plant, but plants occupied by ants bore
211 seeds per plant. Although ants are not big
enough to kill or seriously injure grasshoppers, they
drive them away by nipping at their feet. Seed
beetles are more vulnerable because they are
much smaller than grasshoppers. The ants prey on
the adult beetles, disturb females as they lay their
eggs on developing fruits, and eat many of the
eggs they do manage to lay.
87
38 – 3 Transgenic Plants
Genes from virtually any organism, from viruses to
humans, can now be inserted into plants, creating
what are known as transgenic plants. Now used in
agriculture, there are approximately 109 million
acres of transgenic crops grown worldwide, 68
percent of which are in the United States. The most
common transgenic crops are soybeans, corn,
cotton, and canola. Most often, these plants either
contain a gene making them resistant to the
herbicide glyphosate or they contain an insectresistant gene that produces a protein called Bt
toxin.
On the positive side, proponents of transgenic
crops argue that these crops are environmentally
friendly because they allow farmers to use fewer
and less noxious chemicals for crop production. For
example, a 21 percent reduction in the use of
insecticide has been reported on Bt cotton
(transgenic cotton that produces Bt toxin). In
addition, when glyphosate is used to control
weeds, other more persistent herbicides do not
need to be applied.
On the negative side, opponents of transgenic
crops suggest that there are many questions that
need to be answered before transgenic crops are
grown on a large scale. One question deals with
the effects that Bt plants have on nontarget
organisms such as beneficial insects, worms, and
birds that consume the genetically engineered
crop. For example, monarch caterpillars feeding on
milkweed plants near Bt cornfields will eat some
corn pollen that has fallen on the milkweed leaves.
Laboratory studies indicate that caterpillars can die
from eating Bt pollen. However, field tests indicate
that Bt corn is not likely to harm monarchs.
Furthermore, the application of pesticides (the
alternative to growing Bt plants) has been
demonstrated to cause widespread harm to
nontarget insects.
Another unanswered question is whether herbicideresistant genes will move into the populations of
weeds. Crop plants are sometimes grown in areas
where weedy relatives also live. If the crop plants
hybridize and reproduce with weedy relatives, then
this herbicide-resistant gene will be perpetuated in
the offspring. In this way, the resistant gene can
make its way into the weed population. If this
happens, a farmer can no longer use glyphosate,
for example, to kill those weeds. This scenario is
not likely to occur in many instances because there
are no weedy relatives growing near the crop plant.
However, in some cases, it may become a serious
problem. For example, canola readily hybridizes
with mustard weed species and could transfer its
herbicide-resistant genes to those weeds.
We know that evolution will occur when transgenic
plants grown on a large scale over a period of time.
Of special concern is the development of insect
populations resistant to the Bt toxin. This pesticide
has been applied to plants for decades without the
development of insect-resistant populations.
However, transgenic Bt plants express the toxin in
all tissues throughout growing season. Therefore,
all insects carrying genes that make them
susceptible to the toxin will die. That leaves only
the genetically resistant insects alive to perpetuate
the population. When these resistant insects mate,
they will produce a high proportion of offspring
capable of surviving in the presence of the Bt toxin.
Farmers are attempting to slow the development of
insect resistance in Bt crops by, for example,
planting nontransgenic border rows to provide a
refuge for susceptible insects. These insects may
allow Bt susceptibility to remain in the population.
Perhaps the most serious concern about the
transgenic crop plants currently in use is that they
encourage farmers to move farther away from
sustainable agricultural farming practices, meaning
ones that allow natural resources to continually
regenerate over the long run. Transgenics, at least
superficially, simplify farming by reducing the
choices made by the manager. Planting a
glyphosate-resistant crop commits a farmer to
using that herbicide for the reason, probably to the
exclusion of all other herbicides and other weedcontrol practices. Farmers who use Bt transgenics
may not feel that they need to follow through with
integrated pest-management practices that use
beneficial insects and timely applications of
pesticides to control insect pests. A more
sustainable approach would be to plant
nontransgenic corn, monitor the fields throughout
the growing season, and then apply a pesticide
only if and when needed.

72 – 1 Invading Algae
Biological invasions by exotic species are an
escalating threat to biodiversity around the globe.
Invasive species can displace native ones and
irrevocably alter ecosystems. Most imported
species either die or have limited growth in their
new home, but a small percentage of the
newcomers are opportunists whose growth is
dangerously out of control. The story of how
Caulerpa taxifolia became famous as one of these
species began in 1989, when Dr. Alexandre
Meinesz, a marine biologist at the University of
Nice in France, learned that this exotic alga, which
is native to the Caribbean and other tropical seas,
was thriving in the Mediterranean waters off the
coast of Monaco. Upon investigation, Meinesz
discovered that a mutant variety of C. taxifolia was
dumped into the Mediterranean with other
aquarium refuse by the prestigious Oceanographic
Institute of Monaco. Eventually, the C. taxifolia was
traced back to a stock developed at the Wilhelma
Zoological and Botanical Gardens in Stuttgart,
Germany. This stock of C. taxifolia had caught the
attention of amateur and professional aquarists for
its exceptional beauty and hardiness and had been
widely distributed in public and private aquaria in
the 1980s.
Instead of dying in the cold winter waters of the
Mediterranean Sea as the tropical variety of C.
taxifolia does, the mutant variety can withstand
several months at temperatures that range
between 10° and 13° C. In addition, the alga grows
equally well on a variety of ocean substrates---
sand, mud, or rocks--and from near the surface to
depths of 50 meters. When temperatures exceed
18°C, the mutant Caulerpa grows at a remarkable
rate, capable of elongating by 2 centimeters in a
single day and forming a new frond every 2 days. A
single square meter of seafloor can be matted with
5,500 leafy fronds. All of this growth is asexual.
Unlike the tropical form, the mutated form of C.
taxifolia produces only male gametes in the
Mediterranean and thus replicates only by
fragmentation. Just a small piece can regenerate
and colonize an area. In fact, it is believed that
fishing nets and boat anchors as well as the ripping
action of storms have helped the alga spread to
new areas.
With such a rapid rate of growth, the Mediterranean
Caulerpa grows quickly over the sea bottom,
blanketing all other sea life such as marine
angiosperms, native algae, corals, and sea fans. lt
cuts off vital essentials such as sunlight for
photosynthesis and currents for filter feeding of
nutrients. The area becomes a Caulerpa lawn while
species diversity is lost. In addition, C, taxifolia is
inedible to most marine herbivores because of the
presence of toxic compounds, primarily
caulerpenyne. With no predator to inhibit its
phenomenal growth, the alga had encompassed
the Mediterranean coasts of Monaco, France, Italy,
Spain, and the Croatian coast on the Adriatic Sea
covering 30,000 hectares by 2002. Caulerpa
infestations have also been found in southern
Australia, in estuaries near Sydney and Adelaide.
Various methods have been tried to eradicate this
deadly invader. Divers have been employed to rip
the alga out by hand, but care must be taken
because even a small fragment is capable of
colonizing new areas. Black plastic tarps have
been placed over the alga in an attempt to deprive
it of life-giving sunlight. Chemicals such as copper,
a conventional algicide, and toxic levels of salt
have also been applied to Caulerpa fields. There
has been limited success but only if the area of
invasion is small.
One hopeful avenue is biological control. In
biological control, a disease or predator of the
invasive organism is introduced and allowed to
destroy it. In the native range of the tropical C.
taxiolie, two species of sea slug are immune to its
poisons and feed on the alga exclusively. They
suck the cytoplasm out of the leaves and
incorporate the algal chloroplasts, the part of the
plant that contains green photosynthetic pigment,
into their skin. The chloroplasts provide camouflage
as the snails feed in the Caulerpa fields and,
surprisingly, continue to photosynthesize, providing
additional nutrition for the slugs. Dr. Meinesz is
suggesting the importation of these slugs to the
Mediterranean as the only way to eliminate the
immense area that Caulerpa now covers. But many
experts fear that another exotic importation may
lead to more environmental damage.

73 – 1 How Effective Are Structural Plant
Defenses?
Some of the least costly defenses,in terms of
energy use,available to plants are structures that
make penetration by predators difficult,if not
impossible. These include tough leaves,spines,and
epidermal hairs on leaves,which may trap,impale,or
fence out insects and discourage browsing by
vertebrate herbivores,as well as hard-coated
seeds.These structures may have evolved early in
the history of the plants,when they might have
been subject to even greater predatory
pressures.Because they represent little
investment,plants still retain them.
Many seeds have thick, hard seed coats that
provide protection from seed-eating animals. The
problem with such seed defense is that the seeds
need to be scarified-the hard seed needs
scratching or scoring of the seed coat to weaken itso the seedling itself can escape. If the seed is not
scarified, the seedling embryo is sealed in, never to
germinate. Many plants, however, have turned
seed predation into a mechanism for seed
dispersal, such as the transport and caching of
seeds by squirrels, jays, mice, and ants.
The role of structural defenses in plants was largely
presumed until experimental evidence was sought
to demonstrate the effectiveness of such apparent
defensive structures against grazing herbivores.
Researchers investigated experimentally the
effects of plant spinescence on the feeding habits
of three large browsing mammalian herbivores of
Africa. These were the kudu,a large African
antelope attaining a female body weight of 180
kilograms; the impala,a medium-sized African
antelope attaining a female body weight of 50
kg;and the Boer goat,a domestic ungulate weighing
about 35 kg.The experimenters hand reared the
antelope from calves to allow observation of
feeding habits from very close range,1 to 5
meters,under natural conditions,to determine biting
rates the animals employed.They converted the
bites to dry biomass by collecting samples of
leaves and shoots of a size similar to those eaten
and drying them to a constant weight.They
calculated eating rate as the product of bite size
(dry mass)and biting rate.
Another one of their experiments involved a
detailed study to examine the influence of
spinescence.They selected ten plants each of five
species of trees at a height accessible to impalas
outside the enclosure.The woody plants exhibited
three basic types of spinescence:paired prickles or
thorns situated in or close to the leaf
axils;short,sharp-tipped branchlets or
spines,sometimes carrying small leaves;and
prickles of various kinds on leaves.Thorns were
either straight and long,up to 70 millimeters,or short
and sharply curved (hooked). On each tree,two
branches were matched for size,shape,density of
leaf cover,and ease of access to impalas.These
paired branches were labeled and the thorns were
removed from one of the branches in each pair.
Two months later,researchers visually estimated
the relative loss of foliage from browsing.
Results clearly showed that thorns and spines
affected the feeding behavior of the three
ungulates.These structures restricted bite sizes to
mostly single leaves or leaf clusters,and hooked
thorns retarded biting rates.Acceptability of leaves
of those plant species offering small leaf size along
with prickles was lower,at least for kudu,than those
of other palatable plant species.The inhibitory
effect of prickles was greater for impalas and goats
than for kudu, which bit off the shoot ends in spite
of the prickles.For certain straight-thorned
species,kudu compensated partially for their slow
eating rates by spending more time gathering the
leaves.Most spinescent species were similar to
unarmed palatable species in their acceptability to
the ungulates,even though the armed species had
a higher crude protein to their foliage.Probably
these spinescent species,especially species of
Acacia plants,would be preferred over unarmed
species but for the thorns.
The main effect of these armed structural defense
features is to restrict bite size,thus increasing
handling time.Thorns,spines,and prickles restrict
foliage losses to large herbivores.In addition,the
animals may incur scar tissue in the esophagus
and scratches in the mouth and throat.These
experiments show that at least in some cases
structural plant defenses are effective at protecting
plants.

44 – 3 Seagrasses
Many areas of the shallow sea bottom are covered
with a lush growth of aquatic flowering plants
adapted to live submerged in seawater. These
plants are collectively called seagrasses. Seagrass
beds are strongly influenced by several physical
factors. The most significant is water motion:
currents and waves. Since seagrass systems exist
in both sheltered and relatively open areas, they
are subject to differing amounts of water motion.
For any given seagrass system, however, the water
motion is relatively constant. Seagrass meadows in
relatively turbulent waters tend to form a mosaic of
individual mounds, whereas meadows in relatively
calm waters tend to form flat, extensive carpets.
The seagrass beds, in turn, dampen wave action,
particularly if the blades reach the water surface.
This damping effect can be significant to the point
where just one meter into a seagrass bed the wave
motion can be reduced to zero. Currents are also
slowed as they move into the bed.
The slowing of wave action and currents means
that seagrass beds tend to accumulate sediment.
However, this is not universal and depends on the
currents under which the bed exists. Seagrass
beds under the influence of strong currents tend to
have many of the lighter particles, including
seagrass debris, moved out, whereas beds in weak
current areas accumulate lighter detrital material. It
is interesting that temperate seagrass beds
accumulate sediments from sources outside the
beds, whereas tropical seagrass beds derive most
of their sediments from within.
Since most seagrass systems are depositional
environments, they eventually accumulate organic
material that leads to the creation of fine-grained
sediments with a much higher organic content than
that of the surrounding unvegetated areas. This
accumulation, in turn, reduces the water movement
and the oxygen supply. The high rate of
metabolism (the processing of energy for survival)
of the microorganisms in the sediments causes
sediments to be anaerobic (without oxygen) below
the first few millimeters. According to ecologist J.
W. Kenworthy, anaerobic processes of the
microorganisms in the sediment are an important
mechanism for regenerating and recycling nutrients
and carbon, ensuring the high rates of
productivity—that is, the amount of organic material
produced—that are measured in those beds. In
contrast to other productivity in the ocean, which is
confined to various species of algae and bacteria
dependent on nutrient concentrations in the water
column, seagrasses are rooted plants that absorb
nutrients from the sediment or substrate. They are,
therefore, capable of recycling nutrients into the
ecosystem that would otherwise be trapped in the
bottom and rendered unavailable.
Other physical factors that have an effect on
seagrass beds include light, temperature, and
desiccation (drying out). For example, water depth
and turbidity (density of particles in the water)
together or separately control the amount of light
available to the plants and the depth to which the
seagrasses may extend. Although marine botanist
W. A. Setchell suggested early on that temperature
was critical to the growth and reproduction of
eelgrass, it has since been shown that this
particularly widespread seagrass grows and
reproduces at temperatures between 2 and 4
degrees Celsius in the Arctic and at temperatures
up to 28 degrees Celsius on the northeastern coast
of the United States. Still, extreme temperatures, in
combination with other factors, may have dramatic
detrimental effects. For example, in areas of the
cold North Atlantic, ice may form in winter.
Researchers Robertson and Mann note that when
the ice begins to break up, the wind and tides may
move the ice around, scouring the bottom and
uprooting the eelgrass. In contrast, at the southern
end of the eelgrass range, on the southeastern
coast of the United States, temperatures over 30
degrees Celsius in summer cause excessive
mortality. Seagrass beds also decline if they are
subjected to too much exposure to the air. The
effect of desiccation is often difficult to separate
from the effect of temperature. Most seagrass beds
seem tolerant of considerable changes in salinity
(salt levels) and can be found in brackish
(somewhat salty) waters as well as in full-strength
seawater.
91
44 – 4 What is a Community?
The Black Hills forest, the prairie riparian forest,
and other forests of the western United States can
be separated by the distinctly different
combinations of species they comprise. It is easy to
distinguish between prairie riparian forest and
Black Hills forest—one is a broad-leaved forest of
ash and cottonwood trees, the other is a coniferous
forest of ponderosa pine and white spruce trees.
One has kingbirds; the other juncos (birds with
white outer tail feathers). The fact that ecological
communities are indeed, recognizable clusters of
species led some early ecologists, particularly
those living in the beginning of the twentieth
century, to claim that communities are highly
integrated, precisely balanced assemblages. This
claim harkens back to even earlier arguments
about the existence of a balance of nature, where
every species is there for a specific purpose, like a
vital part in a complex machine. Such a belief
would suggest that to remove any species, whether
it be plant, bird, or insect, would somehow disrupt
the balance, and the habitat would begin to
deteriorate. Likewise, to add a species may be
equally disruptive.
One of these pioneer ecologists was Frederick
Clements, who studied ecology extensively
throughout the Midwest and other areas in North
America. He held that within any given region of
climate, ecological communities tended to slowly
converge toward a single endpoint, which he called
the "climatic climax". This "climax" community was,
in Clements's mind, the most well-balanced,
integrated grouping of species that could occur
within that particular region. Clements even thought
that the process of ecological succession—the
replacement of some species by others over time—
was somewhat akin to the development of an
organism, from embryo to adult. Clements thought
that succession represented discrete stages in the
development of the community (rather like infancy,
childhood, and adolescence), terminating in the
climatic "adult" stage, when the community became
self-reproducing and succession ceased.
Clements's view of the ecological community
reflected the notion of a precise balance of nature.
Clements was challenged by another pioneer
ecologist, Henry Gleason, who took the opposite
view. Gleason viewed the community as largely a
group of species with similar tolerances to the
stresses imposed by climate and other factors
typical of the region. Gleason saw the element of
chance as important in influencing where species
occurred. His concept of the community suggests
that nature is not highly integrated. Gleason
thought succession could take numerous
directions, depending upon local circumstances.
Who was right? Many ecologists have made
precise measurements, designed to test the
assumptions of both the Clements and Gleason
models. For instance, along mountain slopes, does
one life zone, or habitat type, grade sharply or
gradually into another? If the divisions are sharp,
perhaps the reason is that the community is so well
integrated, so holistic, so like Clements viewed it,
that whole clusters of species must remain
together. If the divisions are gradual, perhaps, as
Gleason suggested, each species is responding
individually to its environment, and clusters of
species are not so integrated that they must always
occur together.
It now appears that Gleason was far closer to the
truth than Clements. The ecological community is
largely an accidental assemblage of species with
similar responses to a particular climate. Green ash
trees are found in association with plains
cottonwood trees because both can survive well on
floodplains and the competition between them is
not so strong that only one can persevere. One
ecological community often flows into another so
gradually that it is next to impossible to say where
one leaves off and the other begins. Communities
are individualistic.
This is not to say that precise harmonies are not
present within communities. Most flowering plants
could not exist were it not for their pollinators—and
vice versa. Predators, disease organisms, and
competitors all influence the abundance and
distribution of everything from oak trees to field
mice. But if we see a precise balance of nature, it is
largely an artifact of our perception, due to the
illusion that nature, especially a complex system
like a forest, seems so unchanging from one day to
the next.
92
47 – 3 Coral Reefs
An important environment that is more or less
totally restricted to the intertropical zone is the coral
reef. Coral reefs are found where the ocean water
temperature is not less than 21 °C, where there is a
firm substratum, and where the seawater is not
rendered too dark by excessive amounts of riverborne sediment. They will not grow in very deep
water, so a platform within 30 to 40 meters of the
surface is a necessary prerequisite for their
development. Their physical structure is dominated
by the skeletons of corals, which are carnivorous
animals living off zooplankton. However, in addition
to corals there are enormous quantities of algae,
some calcareous, which help to build the reefs. The
size of reefs is variable. Some atolls are very
large—Kwajelein in the Marshall Islands of the
South Pacific is 120 kilometers long and as much
as 24 kilometers across-but most are very much
smaller, and rise only a few meters above the
water. The 2,000 kilometer complex of reefs known
as the Great Barrier Reef, which forms a gigantic
natural breakwater off the northeast coast of
Australia, is by far the greatest coral structure on
Earth.
Coral reefs have fascinated scientists for almost
200 years, and some of the most pertinent
observations of them were made in the 1830s by
Charles Darwin on the voyage of the Beagle. He
recognized that there were three major kinds:
fringing reefs, barrier reefs, and atolls; and he saw
that they were related to each other in a logical and
gradational sequence. A fringing reef is one that
lies close to the shore of some continent or island.
Its surface forms an uneven and rather rough
platform around the coast, about the level of low
water, and its outer edge slopes downwards into
the sea. Between the fringing reef and the land
there is sometimes a small channel or lagoon.
When the lagoon is wide and deep and the reef lies
at some distance from the shore and rises from
deep water it is called a barrier reef. An atoll is a
reef in the form of a ring or horseshoe with a
lagoon in the center.
Darwin s theory was that the succession from one
coral reef type to another could be achieved by the
upward growth of coral from a sinking platform, and
that there would be a progression from a fringing
reef, through the barrier reef stage until, with the
disappearance through subsidence (sinking) of the
central island, only a reef-enclosed lagoon or atoll
would survive. A long time after Darwin put forward
this theory, some deep boreholes were drilled in
the Pacific atolls in the 1950s. The drill holes
passed through more than a thousand meters of
coral before reaching the rock substratum of the
ocean floor, and indicated that the coral had been
growing upward for tens of millions of years as
Earth's crust subsided at a rate of between 15 and
51 meters per million years. Darwin s theory was
therefore proved basically correct. There are some
submarine islands called guyots and seamounts, in
which subsidence associated with sea-floor
spreading has been too speedy for coral growth to
keep up.
Like mangrove swamps, coral reefs are extremely
important habitats. Their diversity of coral genera is
greatest in the warm waters of the Indian Ocean
and the western Pacific. Indeed, they have been
called the marine version of the tropical rain forest,
rivaling their terrestrial counterparts in both
richness of species and biological productivity.
They also have significance because they provide
coastal protection, opportunities for recreation, and
are potential sources of substances like medicinal
drugs. At present they are coming under a variety
of threats, of which two of the most important are
dredging and the effects of increased siltation
brought about by accelerated erosion from
neighboring land areas.
93
50 – 4 Forest Succession
Succession is a continuous change in the species
composition, structure, and function of a forest
through time following disturbance. Each stage of
succession is referred to as a successional sere.
The final stage of succession, which is generally
self-replacing, is referred to as the climax sere.
There are two major types of succession: primary
and secondary. Primary succession is the
establishment of vegetation on bare rocks or
radically disturbed soil. Secondary succession is
the reestablishment of vegetation following a
disturbance that killed or removed the vegetation
but did not greatly affect the soil. Volcanic
eruptions, retreating glaciers, and bare sand dunes
are examples of sites subject to primary
succession, while clear-cutting of forests, wild fires,
and hurricanes are examples of sites subject to
secondary succession. Hundreds to thousands of
years are required for primary succession to reach
the climax sere, compared to decades to hundreds
of years for it to occur in secondary succession. A
longer time is needed to reach the climax sere for
primary than secondary succession because soil
development must first take place in primary
succession. The rate of succession is dependent
upon the extent of the disturbance and the
availability of appropriate seeds for recolonization.
What morphological (structural) and
ecophysiological characteristics determine the
species composition and abundance in
succession? In general, nitrogen fixing
plants(plants that can make use of atmospheric
nitrogen) are important early succession species in
primary succession because nitrogen is not derived
from the weathering of rock and little or no organic
matter is present in the soil. Weedy plants are
common early successional species because of
their rapid growth and high reproductive rates,
while stress-tolerant species are common late
successional species.
The structure of a forest changes as well in
secondary succession. Depending on the type and
the severity of the disturbance, a moderate to large
amount of dead organic matter from the previous
forest remains on the site immediately from the
disturbance. The leaf area of the forest is at a
minimum and slowly increases as new vegetation
occupies the site. Following a disturbance, such as
a fire, the new canopy (the uppermost spreading
and branching layer of a forest) is largely
composed of similar-aged, or even-aged, trees.
Light, nutrient, and water availability are highest
during the early successional sere because the
vegetation has not completely occupied the site.
Canopy closure, or maximum leaf area, can occur
within several years after disturbance in some
tropical forests, but may take three to fifty years in
evergreen forests.
In the second stage of forest development there is
tree mortality caused by competition for light,
nutrients and water. The intense intraspecies
(within a species) and interspecies (between
species) competition for light, nutrients and water
induces the mortality of plants that are shaded or
have one or more life-history characteristics that
are not well adapted to the changing environment.
The third stage of forest development is
characterized by openings in the overstory canopy,
caused by tree mortality, and the renewed growth
of understory in response to increased light
reaching the forest floor. Consequently, the forest
canopy becomes more complex, or multilayered.
The final stage of forest development, the climax or
old growth stage, is characterized by a species
composition that in theory can continue to replace
itself unless a catastrophic disturbance occurs.
Unique characteristics of old growth forests include
large accumulation of standing and fallen dead
trees--referred to as coarse woody debris. Also, the
annual input of forest litter is dominated by coarse
woody debris compared to the earlier stages of
forest development, when leaf and fine root debris
were the dominant sources of nutrients and organic
matter input into the soil.
Some ecosystems may never reach the latter
stages of succession if natural disturbances (fire,
flooding, hurricanes, etc.) are frequent. A pyric
climax refers to an ecosystem that never reaches
the potential climax vegetation defined by climate
because of frequent fires. The ecotone, a
boundary, between grassland and forest is a pyric
climax, and only with fire suppression have
woodlands and forests began to advance into
these regions.

53 – 2 Rain Forest Soils
On viewing the lush plant growth of a tropical rain
forest, most people would conclude that the soil
beneath it is rich in nutrients. However, although
rain forest soils are highly variable, they have in
common the fact that abundant rainfall washes
mineral nutrients out of them and into streams. This
process is known as leaching. Because of rain
leaching, most tropical rain forest soils have low to
very low mineral nutrient content, in dramatic
contrast to mineral-rich grassland soils. Tropical
forest soils also often contain particular types of
clays that, unlike the mineral-binding clays of
temperate forest soils, do not bind mineral ions
well. Aluminum is the dominant cation (positively
charged ion) present in tropical soils; but plants do
not require this element, and it is moderately toxic
to a wide range of plants. Aluminum also reduces
the availability of phosphorus, an element in high
demand by plants.
High moisture and temperatures speed the growth
of soil microbes that decompose organic
compounds, so tropical soils typically contain far
lower amounts of organic materials (humus) than
do other forest or grassland soils. Because organic
compounds help loosen compact clay soils, hold
water, and bind mineral nutrients, the relative lack
of organic materials in tropical soils is deleterious to
plants. Plant roots cannot penetrate far into hard
clay soils, and during dry periods, the soil cannot
hold enough water to supply plant needs. Because
the concentration of dark-colored organic materials
is low in tropical soils, they are often colored red or
yellow by the presence of iron, aluminum, and
manganese oxides; when dry, these soils become
rock hard. The famous Cambodian temples of
Angkor Wat, which have survived for many
centuries, were constructed from blocks of such
hard rain forest soils.
Given such poor soils, how can lush tropical forests
exist? The answer is that the forest's minerals are
held in its living biomass—the trees and other
plants and the animals. In contrast to grasslands,
where a large proportion of plant biomass is
produced underground, that of tropical forests is
nearly all aboveground. Dead leaves, branches,
and other plant parts, as well as the wastes and
bodies of rain forest animals, barely reach the
forest floor before they are rapidly decayed by
abundant decomposers—bacterial and fungal.
Minerals released by decay are quickly absorbed
by multitudinous shallow, fine tree feeder roots and
stored in plant tissues. Many tropical rain forest
plants (like those in other forests) have mycorrhizal
(fungus-root) partners whose delicate hyphae
spread through great volumes of soil, from which
they release and absorb minerals and ferry them
back to the host plant in exchange for needed
organic compounds. The fungal hyphae are able to
absorb phosphorus that plant roots could not
themselves obtain from the very dilute soil
solutions, and fungal hyphae can transfer mineral
nutrients from one forest plant to another.
Consequently, tropical rain forests typically have
what are known as closed nutrient systems, in
which minerals are handed off from one organism
to another with little leaking through to the soil.
When mineral nutrients do not spend much time in
the soil, they cannot be leached into streams.
Closed nutrient systems have evolved in response
to the leaching effects of heavy tropical rainfall.
Evidence for this conclusion is that nutrient
systems are more open in the richest tropical soils
and tightest in the poorest soils.
The growth of organisms is dependent on the
availability of nutrients, none of which is more
important than nitrogen. Although there is an
abundant supply of nitrogen in Earth’s atmosphere,
it cannot be absorbed by plants unless it is “fixed,”
or combined chemically with other elements to form
nitrogen compounds. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria help
tropical rain forest plants cope with the poor soils
there by supplying them with needed nitrogen.
Many species of tropical rain forest trees belong to
the legume family, which is known for associations
of nitrogen-fixing bacteria within root nodules. Also,
cycads (a type of tropical plant that resembles a
palm tree) produce special aboveground roots that
harbor nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria. By growing
above the ground, the roots are exposed to
sunlight, which the cyanobacteria require for
growth. Nitrogen fixation by free-living bacteria in
tropical soils is also beneficial.

55 – 2 Evolution of the Flowering Plants
Many aspects of the history of flowering plants
(angiosperms) remain mysterious. Evidence of the
earliest angiosperms comes from fossilized leaves,
stems, fruits, pollen, and, very rarely, flowers. In
addition, there has been much study of modern
plant morphology (structure) and genetics in order
to determine which living species might be most
closely related to the ancient ancestors of
angiosperms. Despite intensive efforts for over 200
years, scientists have still not reached consensus
on which type of plant was the ancestor to the
angiosperms, and when and where the
angiosperms first evolved. Indeed, Charles Darwin
himself called the origin of the flowering plants an
"abominable mystery."
What type of plant was the ancestor to the
angiosperms? Most botanists now agree that the
flowering plants are monophyletic in origin,
meaning that they evolved from a common
ancestor. Some paleontologists have suggested
that the common ancestor may have been a type of
cycad (palmlike tropical plants). Other
paleontologists maintain that the angiosperms may
have evolved from seed-bearing ferns. Finally,
analysis of the morphological traits of some
primitive living plants suggests that the ancestor
may have been related to the modern pines. The
question of angiosperm ancestry remains
unresolved.
The time and place of the first appearance of
flowering plants have long been a topic of great
interest. There is good fossil evidence that early
angiosperms, including a number resembling
modern magnolias, were present in the Early
Cretaceous geologic period (more than 100 million
years ago). Angiosperms became increasingly
abundant during this period. Between 100 million
and 65 million years ago, a period known as the
Late Cretaceous, angiosperms increased from less
than 1 percent of flora (plant life) to well over 50
percent. Many of the modern plant families
appeared during this time period. In the Early
Tertiary period which followed: angiosperms
increased to comprise 90 percent or more of
Earth's total flora. Where did these successful
plants first originate and spread from?
Analysis of the fossil leaf structure and geographic
distribution of the earliest Cretaceous angiosperms
has led many biogeographers to conclude that they
evolved in the tropics and then migrated poleward.
It is known that angiosperms did not become
dominant in the high latitudes until the Late
Cretaceous. Paleontologists have recovered fossil
angiosperm leaves, stems, and pollen from Early
Cretaceous deposits in eastern South America and
western Africa. These two continents were joined
together as part of Gondwanaland, one of two
supercontinents that existed at that time. The
locations of these early angiosperm finds would
have been close to the equator during the Early
Cretaceous and are conformable with a model by
which angiosperms spread from the tropics
poleward.
Not all botanists agree with an African-South
American center for the evolution and dispersal of
the angiosperms, pointing out that many of the
most primitive forms of flowering plants are found in
the South Pacific, including portions of Fiji, New
Caledonia, New Guinea, eastern Australia, and the
Malay Archipelago. Recent genetic research has
identified the rare tropical shrub Amborella as
being the living plant most closely related to the
ancient ancestor of all the angiosperms. This small
shrub, which has tiny yellow-white flowers and red
fruit; is found only on New Caledonia, a group of
islands in the South Pacific. Many botanists
conclude that the best explanation for the large
numbers of primitive living angiosperms in the
South Pacific region is that this is where the
flowering plants first evolved and these modern
species are relics of this early evolution.
Comparisons of the DNA of Amborella and many
hundreds of species of flowering plants suggest
that the first angiosperm arose and the
development of separate species occurred about
135 million years ago.
Recently discovered fossils complicate our
understanding of the origin of the angiosperms
even further. Paleontologists from China have
found beautifully preserved fossils of an
angiosperm plant, including flowers and seeds, in
Jurassic period deposits from China. The site,
which is about 130 million years old, is near
modern Beijing. The new fossil plant found at the
site is now the oldest known angiosperm. The age
of the fossils and the very primitive features of the
flowers have led the discoverers to suggest that the
earliest flowering plants may have evolved in
northern Asia.

61 – 3 Grasses of the Prairie
Around 140 species of grasses naturally occur in
the arid Great Plains grasslands of North America
One key to the prairie grasses’ success is their
ability to conserve water in a dry environment. Like
most plants, grasses take in water through their
roots and lose it as water vapor through tiny mouthshaped valves, or stomata, in their leaves. The
larger the surface of the leaf and the more stomata
it bears, the greater the risk that the plant will lose
too much moisture through evaporation and
collapse. Grasses are protected from this trauma
by having a reduced number of stomata and by the
design of their leaves, which take the form of
narrow blades. What’s more, the surfaces of these
reduced leaves are often modified—corrugated
with ridges or covered in hairs-so that the wind
can’t sweep across the surface and draw out
moisture. The roughened surface holds a thin layer
of humid air next to the leaf and thus helps to
reduce the “evaporative demand,” or drying power,
of the atmosphere. Some grasses, including
western wheatgrass, June grass, and blue grama,
roil up the edges of their leaves during times of
drought to help keep their tissues from drying out.
Why aren’t the stomata kept tightly closed to seal
moisture inside the leaf? The reason is that the
stomata also supply plants with fresh air for
photosynthesis. If plants sealed their stomata, this
life-sustaining process would come to a halt for lack
of carbon dioxide. But if the stomata are thrown
wide open, the plants risk death due to the loss of
moisture through their gaping valves. Prairie
grasses resolve this dilemma by strategic
scheduling. In the fierce blaze of the midday sun,
the stomata close so that water vapor is held in and
carbon dioxide is kept out. In this state, the leaf can
capture solar energy and store it in energy-rich
molecules (a process that requires sunlight but not
carbon dioxide). Then, in the cool of the evening,
when the evaporative demand drops off, the
stomata snap open, letting water vapor trickle out
but also permitting carbon dioxide to flood into the
leaf By mobilizing the energy that was stockpiled
earlier in the day, the leaf uses this carbon dioxide
to manufacture the sugars and other molecules
that it needs for growth (a process that can be
accomplished in total darkness). The result is that
prairie grasses are partially nocturnal: they do most
of their growing at night or in the early hours of the
morning.
Prairie grasses also have another ingenious way of
evading the demands of the sun. Like many
grassland creatures (prairie dogs, ground squirrels,
cottontails, badgers, and so on), they take refuge
underground What we think of as “grass’’-the
aboveground leaves and stems-actually constitutes
less than half of the organism Between 60 and 80
percent of the plant, by weight, typically grows
below ground. A 3-meter stand of big bluestem is
anchored underground by a mass of coarse,
fibrous roots that reaches as much as 3 6 meters
into the earth Blue grama, for its part, seldom lifts
its seed heads very far above the ground, but its
network of fine, branching roots can sometimes
probe the soil for water almost two meters down.
These extensive systems of roots push thirstily
through the soil, intent on sucking up every
available drop of water. But if the soil is very dry, as
it is during periods of drought, the roots can’t draw
in enough moisture to keep pace with losses from
the stomata. Grasses respond by transferring their
most valuable resources (including sugars and
proteins) from their leaves into their roots and,
especially, into their rhizomes (underground
stems). Dead to the world above ground-withered
and crisp-the plants live frugally below the surface,
drawing on their cached supplies and biding their
time until the weather improves When the rains
eventually return, as they inevitably do, the grasses
explode into action, sending out fresh rhizomes,
which in turn put out fresh leaves and roots, to
produce a burgeoning network of tender growth.
The amazingly resilient blue grama can revive from
dormancy, become green, and grow on as little as
five millimeters of rainfall.
97
62 – 4 What Controls Flowering
The timing of flowering and seed production is
precisely tuned to a plant's physiology and the
rigors of its environment. In temperate climate
plants lost flower early enough so that their seeds
can mature before the deadly winds of autumn.
Depending on how quickly the seed and food
develop flowering may occur in spring as it does in
oaks; in summer as in lettuces; or even in autumn
as in asters.
What environmental cues do plants use to
determine the seasons? Most cues such as
temperature or water availability are quite variable:
autumn can be warm; a late snow could fall in
spring; also summer might be unusually cool and
wet. So the only reliable cue is day length: longer
days always mean that spring and summer are
coming; shorter days foretell the onset of autumn
and winter.
With respect to flowering botanists classify plants
as day neutral, long day or short day. A day neutral
plant flowers as soon as it has sufficiently grown
and developed regardless of the length of day. The
neutral plants include tomatoes, corn, snapdragons
and roses. Although the naming is traditional, long
day and short day plants are better described as
short night and long night plants because their
flowering actually depends on the duration of
continuous darkness rather than on day length.
Short night plants (which include lettuces, spinach,
iris, clover and petunias) flower when the length of
darkness is shorter than a species' specific critical
period. Long night plants(including asters,
potatoes, soy beans, goldenrod and cockleburs)
flower when the length of uninterrupted darkness is
longer than the species' specific critical period.
Thus spinach is classified as a short night plant
because it flowers only if the night is shorter than
eleven hours (its critical period), and the cocklebur
is a long night plant because it flowers only if an
uninterrupted darkness lasts more than 8.5 hours.
Both of these plants will flower with ten-hour nights.
Plant scientists can induce flowering. Plant
scientists can induce flowering in the cocklebur by
exposing leaves to long nights (longer than its 8.5
hour critical period) in a special chamber, while the
rest of the plant continues to experience short
nights. Clearly, a signal that induces flowering
transmitted from the leave to the flowering bud.
Plant physiologists have been attempting for
decades to isolate these elusive signaling molecule
often called florigen (literally, flowering maker).
Some researchers believe they are close to
demonstrating a flower's stimulating substance for
specific type of plant. Using genetic manipulation, it
is likely, however, that interactions among multiple
and yet unidentified planthormones stimulate or
inhibit flowering, and that these chemicals may
differ among plant species. Researchers have had
more success in determining how plants measure
the length of uninterrupted darkness, which is a
crucial stimulus for producing whatever substance
control flowering.
To measure continuous darkness, a plant needs
two things: some sort of metabolic clock to
measure time (the duration of darkness) and a light
detecting system to set the clock. Virtually all
organisms have an internal biological clock that
measures the time even without environmental
cues. In most organisms including plants, the
biological clock is poorly understood, but we know
that the environmental cues, particularly light, can
reset the clock. How do plants detect light? The
light detecting system of plants is a pigment in
leaves called phytochrome (literally, plant color).
Plants seem to use the phytochrome system in
combination with their internal biological clocks to
detect the duration of continuous darkness.
Cockleburs, for example, flower under the schedule
of sixteen hours of darkness and eight hours of
light. However, interrupting the middle of the dark
period with just a minute or two of lights prevents
flowering. Thus their flowering is controlled by the
length of continuous darkness. It is evident that
even brief exposure to sunlight or white light will
reset their biological clocks. The color of the light
used for the light exposure is also important. A
nighttime flash of pure red light inhibits flowering,
while flash of light at the far-red end of the
spectrum has no effect on flowering, as if no light
were detected.
98
62 – 1 Plant Adaptations to Cool Environments
There are many interesting adaptations that allow
plants to survive in cool environments. One obvious
strategy is dormancy (a suspension of activity)
during the cold season. Most of the common trees
in the forests of northeastern North America,
western Europe, and eastern Asia, such as the
maples, oaks, beech, birches, and ashes, are
deciduous trees that lose their frost-sensitive
leaves during the cold winter season. In most of
these trees, the leaves suffer damage at
temperatures of freezing or just below. The new
leaves arise in the spring from winter buds that can
remain viable at colder temperatures.
Most of the needle-leaved conifers of the northern
and alpine forests, such as pines, spruces, and firs,
do not lose their leaves during the winter. How do
such evergreen plants escape intracellular freezing
(freezing within cells) and tissue destruction when
temperatures may drop to -40° C or colder? In
these plants, the onset of cool temperatures
causes physiological changes that allow plant
tissue to either avoid freezing or restrict freezing to
extracellular areas (those outside of cells). For
plants to avoid freezing, they must chemically alter
their liquids into a form that is analogous to
antifreeze in automobiles. The liquids in these
plants can be cooled far below 0° C and will not
freeze. This process is called supercooling and is
achieved by the metabolic synthesis of sugars and
other molecules which, when in solution in the
plant’s tissue, lower the temperature for ice
formation to far below 0° C. Supercooling seems to
be the prevalent mechanism of frost resistance in
herbs. For woody plants, supercooling is
augmented by declines of cellular water content,
greater cellular accommodation to deformation,
and processes that allow water to accumulate and
freeze in extracellular spaces. The loss of water
from the cells to extracellular areas increases the
solute content (the quantity of dissolved
substances) of the remaining cell water, making it
more resistant to freezing. The cell walls can
accommodate the deformations caused by water
freezing on the exterior of the cell. For northern and
alpine evergreens such as pines and spruces, both
supercooling and extracellular ice formation play a
part in allowing the plants to withstand extremely
cold temperatures. One interesting facet of these
physiological adaptations to freezing is that most of
these plants will still be damaged by cold
temperatures if they do not have a period of cooling
in which to adjust to the onset of winter. This
process of physiological preparation for the onset
of winter cold is called frost hardening.
Some members of the cactus family appear to
resist freezing during cool nights by radiating heat
stored during the day in their thick, moist tissue.
The greater the mass of the cactus, the more heat
it can store and the less prone it will be to freezing
damage during the night. How is it then that these
cacti can survive cold temperatures when they are
young and small? The giant saguaro cactus is
perhaps the best-known symbol of the
southwestern desert of North America. In the
popular lore of North America, the distinctive shape
of the multi-stemmed saguaro is a universally
recognized icon that is used to represent deserts in
movies, television, and comics. Yet, this distinctive
and widely recognized plant is actually found only
in the Sonoran Desert of California, Arizona, and
adjacent Mexico. The saguaro cactus is damaged
or killed if exposed to prolonged freezing
temperatures. Desert climates in the northern
Sonoran Desert are typified by warm days but
sometimes experience nighttime temperatures that
are below freezing in the winter. Young saguaros
that survive are found sheltered beneath more
frost-tolerant desert shrubs. The cover of these
shrubs acts as a thermal blanket, capturing heat
radiated from the ground and keeping the
microclimate of the small saguaro warm at night.
As the cactus grows, it eventually rises above the
cover of the protective shrub. The radiation of heat
from the stalk of the large mature cactus prevents
freezing. This strategy works up to a point. The
range of the saguaro is restricted to areas that do
not experience more than about 12 to 24
continuous hours of air temperatures below 0° C. It
appears that after 24 hours of freezing air
temperatures, not enough heat reserve is left in the
saguaro to keep the tissue from freezing.

67 – 3 Taxonomy of Organisms
Classification schemes are used by biologists to
place the huge number of organisms on Earth into
natural groupings. Ideally, these groupings are
made by taxonomists on the basis of shared
distinguishing features. Today taxonomists use
such features as anatomy, developmental stages,
and biochemical similarities to categorize
organisms. Early classification schemes placed all
organisms into either the plant or animal kingdom.
Later, close examination of the unique structure of
fungi and the diversity of single-celled organisms
made it necessary to propose additional kingdoms
that recognized the fundamental differences among
plants, animals, fungi, and unicellular prokaryotes
(organisms whose cells do not have a distinct
membrane- bound nucleus) and eukaryotes
(organisms whose cells have a distinct membranebound nucleus). The current scheme consisting of
five kingdoms-Monera, Protista, Apimalia, Fungi,
and Plantae-was devised in response to this need.
Scientists do not know how many species share
our world Each year 7000 to10,000 new species
are named. The total number of named species is
currently around 1.4 million. However, many
scientists believe that 7 million to 10 million species
may exist, and estimates range as high as 30
million. Of all of the species that have been
identified, about 5 percent are in the Monera and
Protista kingdoms. An additional 22 percent are
plants and fungi, and the rest are animals. This
distribution has little to do with the actual
abundance of these organisms and a lot to do with
the size of the organisms, how easy they are to
classify, and the number of scientists studying
them.
The kingdom Protista, defined as comprising all
single- celled eukaryotic organisms, is not a natural
grouping and scientists disagree about which
organisms it should include Plants, animals, and
fungi all have close protistan relatives and the
separation of single-celled organisms from
multicellular organisms is sometimes problematic. It
is especially so for the algae, which have both
single-celled and multicellular representatives
within most smaller taxonomic groupings. Can
closely related organisms be placed into separate
kingdoms, Protista and Plantae, simply on the
basis of multicellula? If you look at different
textbooks, you will see that the algae,
photosynthetic organisms with simple reproduction,
are sometimes placed entirely into Protista, and
sometimes they are split between Protista and
Plantae depending on whether they are single
celled or multicellular. Some taxonomists split the
multicellular algae into two kingdoms, placing the
multicellular brown and red algae with the protists
and the multicellular green algae into the plant
kingdom. These different attempts to classify
closely related organisms are good examples of
how difficult it is to develop standard criteria for
grouping organisms, even at the kingdom level.
One approach to this problem, enthusiastically
endorsed by Lynn Margulis, a biologist at the
University of Massachusetts, is the creation of the
kingdom Protoctista. This taxonomic category
would include single-celled organisms and their
close descendants(for example, the multicellular
algae but not the animals, fungi, and plants).
Margulis describes the kingdom Protoctista as "the
entire motley and unruly group of nonplant,
nonanimal, nonfungal organisms representative of
lineages of the earliest descendants of the
eukaryotes.
It is conceptually difficult to group one of the largest
multicellular organisms in the world, the brown
algae called giant kelps, with simple microscopic
single-celled organisms. Kelps, some of which are
up to 60 meters long, possess a tissuelike level of
organization that is relatively complex and can
transport materials over long distances, as can the
tissues of higher plants. The cells in kelps and
some other algae are specialized and show
division of labor. However, kelps reproduce like
other algae and differently from plants. Thomas
Cavalier-Smith of the University of British Columbia
has proposed that brown algae merit their own
kingdom (kingdom Chromista) based on
ultrastructural features and molecular comparisons
of all algae.so, even among the algae, there are
clear differences that some scientists believe are
sufficient to justify the status of separate kingdom.
As we learn more about the relationships between
organisms and refine the criteria used to classify
them, classification schemes will change. As the
superficially simple question "In which kingdom
should we place the algae?" illustrates, the
taxonomic categories in textbooks are tentative and
subject to revision as we continue to discover more
about life on Earth.

ANIMALS / SPECIES / ZOOLOGY
02 – 3 The Origins of Cetaceans
It should be obvious that cetaceans-whales,
porpoises, and dolphins-are mammals. They
breathe through lungs, not through gills, and give
birth to live young. Their streamlined bodies, the
absence of hind legs, and the presence of a fluke
and blowhole cannot disguise their affinities with
land dwelling mammals. However, unlike the cases
of sea otters and pinnipeds (seals, sea lions, and
walruses, whose limbs are functional both on land
and at sea), it is not easy to envision what the first
whales looked like. Extinct but already fully marine
cetaceans are known from the fossil record. How
was the gap between a walking mammal and a
swimming whale bridged? Missing until recently
were fossils clearly intermediate, or transitional,
between land mammals and cetaceans.
Very exciting discoveries have finally allowed
scientists to reconstruct the most likely origins of
cetaceans. In 1979, a team looking for fossils in
northern Pakistan found what proved to be the
oldest fossil whale. The fossil was officially named
Pakicetus in honor of the country where the
discovery was made. Pakicetus was found
embedded in rocks formed from river deposits that
were 52 million years old. The river that formed
these deposits was actually not far from an ancient
ocean known as the Tethys Sea.
The fossil consists of a complete skull of an
archaeocyte, an extinct group of ancestors of
modern cetaceans. Although limited to a skull, the
Pakicetus fossil provides precious details on the
origins of cetaceans. The skull is cetacean-like but
its jawbones lack the enlarged space that is filled
with fat or oil and used for receiving underwater
sound in modern whales. Pakicetus probably
detected sound through the ear opening as in land
mammals. The skull also lacks a blowhole, another
cetacean adaptation for diving. Other features,
however, show experts that Pakicetus is a
transitional form between a group of extinct flesheating mammals, the mesonychids, and cetaceans.
It has been suggested that Pakicetus fed on fish in
shallow water and was not yet adapted for life in
the open ocean. It probably bred and gave birth on
land.
Another major discovery was made in Egypt in
1989. Several skeletons of another early whale,
Basilosaurus, were found in sediments left by the
Tethys Sea and now exposed in the Sahara desert.
This whale lived around 40 million years ago, 12
million years after Pakicetus. Many incomplete
skeletons were found but they included, for the first
time in an archaeocyte, a complete hind leg that
features a foot with three tiny toes. Such legs
would have been far too small to have supported
the 50-foot-long Basilosaurus on land.
Basilosaurus was undoubtedly a fully marine whale
with possibly nonfunctional, or vestigial, hind legs.
An even more exciting find was reported in 1994,
also from Pakistan. The now extinct whale
Ambulocetus natans ("the walking whale that
swam") lived in the Tethys Sea 49 million years
ago. It lived around 3 million years after Pakicetus
but 9 million before Basilosaurus. The fossil luckily
includes a good portion of the hind legs. The legs
were strong and ended in long feet very much like
those of a modern pinniped. The legs were
certainly functional both on land and at sea. The
whale retained a tail and lacked a fluke, the major
means of locomotion in modern cetaceans. The
structure of the backbone shows, however, that
Ambulocetus swam like modern whales by moving
the rear portion of its body up and down, even
though a fluke was missing. The large hind legs
were used for propulsion in water. On land, where it
probably bred and gave birth, Ambulocetus may
have moved around very much like a modern sea
lion. It was undoubtedly a whale that linked life on
land with life at sea.

04 – 1 Deer Populations of the Puget Sound
Two species of deer have been prevalent in the
Puget Sound area of Washington State in the
Pacific Northwest of the United States. The blacktailed deer, a lowland, west-side cousin of the mule
deer of eastern Washington, is now the most
common. The other species, the Columbian whitetailed deer, in earlier times was common in the
open prairie country; it is now restricted to the low,
marshy islands and flood plains along the lower
Columbia River.
Nearly any kind of plant of the forest understory
can be part of a deer's diet. Where the forest
inhibits the growth of grass and other meadow
plants, the black-tailed deer browses on
huckleberry, salal, dogwood, and almost any other
shrub or herb. But this is fair-weather feeding. What
keeps the black-tailed deer alive in the harsher
seasons of plant decay and dormancy? One
compensation for not hibernating is the built-in urge
to migrate. Deer may move from high-elevation
browse areas in summer down to the lowland areas
in late fall. Even with snow on the ground, the high
bushy understory is exposed; also snow and wind
bring down leafy branches of cedar, hemlock, red
alder, and other arboreal fodder.
The numbers of deer have fluctuated markedly
since the entry of Europeans into Puget Sound
country. The early explorers and settlers told of
abundant deer in the early 1800s and yet almost in
the same breath bemoaned the lack of this
succulent game animal. Famous explorers of the
north American frontier, Lewis and Clark arrived at
the mouth of the Columbia River on November 14,
1805, in nearly starved circumstances. They had
experienced great difficulty finding game west of
the Rockies and not until the second of December
did they kill their first elk. To keep 40 people alive
that winter, they consumed approximately 150 elk
and 20 deer. And when game moved out of the
lowlands in early spring, the expedition decided to
return east rather than face possible starvation.
Later on in the early years of the nineteenth
century, when Fort Vancouver became the
headquarters of the Hudson's Bay Company, deer
populations continued to fluctuate. David Douglas,
Scottish botanical explorer of the 1830s, found a
disturbing change in the animal life around the fort
during the period between his first visit in 1825 and
his final contact with the fort in 1832. A recent
Douglas biographer states:" The deer which once
picturesquely dotted the meadows around the fort
were gone [in 1832], hunted to extermination in
order to protect the crops."
Reduction in numbers of game should have boded
ill for their survival in later times. A worsening of the
plight of deer was to be expected as settlers
encroached on the land, logging, burning, and
clearing, eventually replacing a wilderness
landscape with roads, cities, towns, and factories.
No doubt the numbers of deer declined still further.
Recall the fate of the Columbian white-tailed deer,
now in a protected status. But for the black-tailed
deer, human pressure has had just the opposite
effect. Wildlife zoologist Helmut Buechner (1953),
in reviewing the nature of biotic changes in
Washington through recorded time, says that
"since the early 1940s, the state has had more
deer than at any other time in its history, the winter
population fluctuating around approximately
320,000 deer (mule and black-tailed deer), which
will yield about 65,000 of either sex and any age
annually for an indefinite period."
The causes of this population rebound are
consequences of other human actions. First, the
major predators of deer-wolves, cougar, and lynxhave been greatly reduced in numbers. Second,
conservation has been insured by limiting times for
and types of hunting. But the most profound reason
for the restoration of high population numbers has
been the fate of the forests. Great tracts of lowland
country deforested by logging, fire, or both have
become ideal feeding grounds of deer. In addition
to finding an increase of suitable browse, like
huckleberry and vine maple, Arthur Einarsen,
longtime game biologist in the Pacific Northwest,
found quality of browse in the open areas to be
substantially more nutritive. The protein content of
shade-grown vegetation, for example, was much
lower than that for plants grown in clearings.

05 – 3 The Cambrian Explosion
The geologic timescale is marked by significant
geologic and biological events, including the origin
of Earth about 4.6 billion years ago, the origin of life
about 3.5 billion years ago, the origin of eukaryotic
life-forms (living things that have cells with true
nuclei) about 1.5 billion years ago, and the origin of
animals about 0.6 billion years ago. The last event
marks the beginning of the Cambrian period.
Animals originated relatively late in the history of
Earth—in only the last 10 percent of Earth's history.
During a geologically brief 100-million-year period,
all modern animal groups (along with other animals
that are now extinct) evolved. This rapid origin and
diversification of animals is often referred to as "the
Cambrian explosion."
Scientists have asked important questions about
this explosion for more than a century. Why did it
occur so late in the history of Earth? The origin of
multicellular forms of life seems a relatively simple
step compared to the origin of life itself. Why does
the fossil record not document the series of
evolutionary changes during the evolution of
animals? Why did animal life evolve so quickly?
Paleontologists continue to search the fossil record
for answers to these questions.
One interpretation regarding the absence of fossils
during this important 100-million-year period is that
early animals were soft bodied and simply did not
fossilize. Fossilization of soft-bodied animals is less
likely than fossilization of hard-bodied animals, but
it does occur. Conditions that promote fossilization
of soft-bodied animals include very rapid covering
by sediments that create an environment that
discourages decomposition. In fact, fossil beds
containing soft-bodied animals have been known
for many years.
The Ediacara fossil formation, which contains the
oldest known animal fossils, consists exclusively of
soft-bodied forms. Although named after a site in
Australia, the Ediacara formation is worldwide in
distribution and dates to Precambrian times. This
700-million-year-old formation gives few clues to
the origins of modern animals, however, because
paleontologists believe it represents an
evolutionary experiment that failed. It contains no
ancestors of modern animal groups.
A slightly younger fossil formation containing
animal remains is the Tommotian formation, named
after a locale in Russia. It dates to the very early
Cambrian period, and it also contains only softbodied forms. At one time, the animals present in
these fossil beds were assigned to various modern
animal groups, but most paleontologists now agree
that all Tommotian fossils represent unique body
forms that arose in the early Cambrian period and
disappeared before the end of the period, leaving
no descendants in modern animal groups.
A third fossil formation containing both soft-bodied
and hard-bodied animals provides evidence of the
result of the Cambrian explosion. This fossil
formation, called the Burgess Shale, is in Yoho
National Park in the Canadian Rocky Mountains of
British Columbia. Shortly after the Cambrian
explosion, mud slides rapidly buried thousands of
marine animals under conditions that favored
fossilization. These fossil beds provide evidence of
about 32 modern animal groups, plus about 20
other animal body forms that are so different from
any modern animals that they cannot be assigned
to any one of the modern groups. These
unassignable animals include a large swimming
predator called Anomalocaris and a soft-bodied
animal called Wiwaxia, which ate detritus or algae.
The Burgess Shale formation also has fossils of
many extinct representatives of modern animal
groups. For example, a well-known Burgess Shale
animal called Sidneyia is a representative of a
previously unknown group of arthropods (a
category of animals that includes insects, spiders,
mites, and crabs).
Fossil formations like the Burgess Shale show that
evolution cannot always be thought of as a slow
progression. The Cambrian explosion involved
rapid evolutionary diversification, followed by the
extinction of many unique animals. Why was this
evolution so rapid? No one really knows. Many
zoologists believe that it was because so many
ecological niches were available with virtually no
competition from existing species. Will zoologists
ever know the evolutionary sequences in the
Cambrian explosion? Perhaps another ancient
fossil bed of soft-bodied animals from 600-millionyear-old seas is awaiting discovery.
103
08 – 2 Extinction of the Dinosaurs
Paleontologists have argued for a long time that
the demise of the dinosaurs was caused by climatic
alterations associated with slow changes in the
positions of continents and seas resulting from
plate tectonics. Off and on throughout the
Cretaceous (the last period of the Mesozoic era,
during which dinosaurs flourished), large shallow
seas covered extensive areas of the continents.
Data from diverse sources, including geochemical
evidence preserved in seafloor sediments, indicate
that the Late Cretaceous climate was milder than
today’s. The days were not too hot, nor the nights
too cold. The summers were not too warm, nor the
winters too frigid. The shallow seas on the
continents probably buffered the temperature of the
nearby air, keeping it relatively constant.
At the end of the Cretaceous, the geological record
shows that these seaways retreated from the
continents back into the major ocean basins. No
one knows why. Over a period of about 100,000
years, while the seas pulled back, climates around
the world became dramatically more extreme:
warmer days, cooler nights; hotter summers, colder
winters. Perhaps dinosaurs could not tolerate these
extreme temperature changes and became extinct.
If true, though, why did cold-blooded animals such
as snakes, lizards, turtles, and crocodiles survive
the freezing winters and torrid summers? These
animals are at the mercy of the climate to maintain
a livable body temperature. It’s hard to understand
why they would not be affected, whereas dinosaurs
were left too crippled to cope, especially if, as some
scientists believe, dinosaurs were warm-blooded.
Critics also point out that the shallow seaways had
retreated from and advanced on the continents
numerous times during the Mesozoic, so why did
the dinosaurs survive the climatic changes
associated with the earlier fluctuations but not with
this one? Although initially appealing, the
hypothesis of a simple climatic change related to
sea levels is insufficient to explain all the data.
Dissatisfaction with conventional explanations for
dinosaur extinctions led to a surprising observation
that, in turn, has suggested a new hypothesis.
Many plants and animals disappear abruptly from
the fossil record as one moves from layers of rock
documenting the end of the Cretaceous up into
rocks representing the beginning of the Cenozoic
(the era after the Mesozoic). Between the last layer
of Cretaceous rock and the first layer of Cenozoic
rock, there is often a thin layer of clay. Scientists
felt that they could get an idea of how long the
extinctions took by determining how long it took to
deposit this one centimeter of clay and they
thought they could determine the time it took to
deposit the clay by determining the amount of the
element iridium (Ir) it contained.
It has not been common at Earth’s since the very
beginning of the planet’s history. Because it usually
exists in a metallic state, it was preferentially
incorporated in Earth’s core as the planet cooled
and consolidated. Ir is found in high concentrations
in some meteorites, in which the solar system’s
original chemical composition is preserved. Even
today, microscopic meteorites continually bombard
Earth, falling on both land and sea. By measuring
how many of these meteorites fall to Earth over a
given period of time, scientists can estimate how
long it might have taken to deposit the observed
amount of Ir in the boundary clay. These
calculations suggest that a period of about one
million years would have been required. However,
other reliable evidence suggests that the deposition
of the boundary clay could not have taken one
million years. So the unusually high concentration
of Ir seems to require a special explanation.
In view of these facts, scientists hypothesized that
a single large asteroid, about 10 to 15 kilometers
across, collided with Earth, and the resulting fallout
created the boundary clay. Their calculations show
that the impact kicked up a dust cloud that cut off
sunlight for several months, inhibiting
photosynthesis in plants; decreased surface
temperatures on continents to below freezing;
caused extreme episodes of acid rain; and
significantly raised long-term global temperatures
through the greenhouse effect. This disruption of
food chain and climate would have eradicated the
dinosaurs and other organisms in less than fifty
years.
104
15 – 2 Mass Extinctions
Cases in which many species become extinct
within a geologically short interval of time are called
mass extinctions. There was one such event at the
end of the Cretaceous period (around 70 million
years ago). There was another, even larger, mass
extinction at the end of the Permian period (around
250 million years ago). The Permian event has
attracted much less attention than other mass
extinctions because mostly unfamiliar species
perished at that time.
The fossil record shows at least five mass
extinctions in which many families of marine
organisms died out. The rates of extinction
happening today are as great as the rates during
these mass extinctions. Many scientists have
therefore concluded that a sixth great mass
extinction is currently in progress.
What could cause such high rates of extinction?
There are several hypotheses, including warming
or cooling of Earth, changes in seasonal
fluctuations or ocean currents, and changing
positions of the continents. Biological hypotheses
include ecological changes brought about by the
evolution of cooperation between insects and
flowering plants or of bottom-feeding predators in
the oceans. Some of the proposed mechanisms
required a very brief period during which all
extinctions suddenly took place; other mechanisms
would be more likely to have taken place more
gradually, over an extended period, or at different
times on different continents. Some hypotheses fail
to account for simultaneous extinctions on land and
in the seas. Each mass extinction may have had a
different cause. Evidence points to hunting by
humans and habitat destruction as the likely
causes for the current mass extinction.
American paleontologists David Raup and John
Sepkoski, who have studied extinction rates in a
number of fossil groups, suggest that episodes of
increased extinction have recurred periodically,
approximately every 26 million years since the midCretaceous period. The late Cretaceous extinction
of the dinosaurs and ammonoids was just one of
the more drastic in a whole series of such recurrent
extinction episodes. The possibility that mass
extinctions may recur periodically has given rise to
such hypotheses as that of a companion star with a
long-period orbit deflecting other bodies from their
normal orbits, making some of them fall to Earth as
meteors and causing widespread devastation upon
impact.
Of the various hypotheses attempting to account
for the late Cretaceous extinctions, the one that
has attracted the most attention in recent years is
the asteroid-impact hypothesis first suggested by
Luis and Walter Alvarez. According to this
hypothesis, Earth collided with an asteroid with an
estimated diameter of 10 kilometers, or with several
asteroids, the combined mass of which was
comparable. The force of collision spewed large
amounts of debris into the atmosphere, darkening
the skies for several years before the finer particles
settled. The reduced level of photosynthesis led to
a massive decline in plant life of all kinds, and this
caused massive starvation first of herbivores and
subsequently of carnivores. The mass extinction
would have occurred very suddenly under this
hypothesis.
One interesting test of the Alvarez hypothesis is
based on the presence of the rare-earth element
iridium (Ir). Earth’s crust contains very little of this
element, but most asteroids contain a lot more.
Debris thrown into the atmosphere by an asteroid
collision would presumably contain large amounts
of iridium, and atmospheric currents would carry
this material all over the globe. A search of
sedimentary deposits that span the boundary
between the Cretaceous and Tertiary periods
shows that there is a dramatic increase in the
abundance of iridium briefly and precisely at this
boundary. This iridium anomaly offers strong
support for the Alvarez hypothesis even though no
asteroid itself has ever been recovered.
An asteroid of this size would be expected to leave
an immense crater, even if the asteroid itself was
disintegrated by the impact. The intense heat of the
impact would produce heat-shocked quartz in
many types of rock. Also, large blocks thrown aside
by the impact would form secondary craters
surrounding the main crater. To date, several such
secondary craters have been found along Mexico’s
Yucatan Peninsula, and heat-shocked quartz has
been found both in Mexico and in Haiti. A location
called Chicxulub, along the Yucatan coast, has
been suggested as the primary impact site.
105
11 – 2 Orientation and Navigation
To South Americans, robins are birds that fly north
every spring. To North Americans, the robins
simply vacation in the south each winter.
Furthermore, they fly to very specific places in
South America and will often come back to the
same trees in North American yards the following
spring. The question is not why they would leave
the cold of winter so much as how they find their
way around. The question perplexed people for
years, until, in the 1950s, a German scientist
named Gustave Kramer provided some answers
and, in the process, raised new questions.
Kramer initiated important new kinds of research
regarding how animals orient and navigate.
Orientation is simply facing in the right direction;
navigation involves finding ones way from point A
to point B.
Early in his research, Kramer found that caged
migratory birds became very restless at about the
time they would normally have begun migration in
the wild. Furthermore, he noticed that as they
fluttered around in the cage, they often launched
themselves in the direction of their normal
migratory route. He then set up experiments with
caged starlings and found that their orientation
was, in fact, in the proper migratory direction
except when the sky was overcast, at which times
there was no clear direction to their restless
movements. Kramer surmised, therefore, that they
were orienting according to the position of the Sun.
To test this idea, he blocked their view of the Sun
and used mirrors to change its apparent position.
He found that under these circumstances, the birds
oriented with respect to the new "Sun." They
seemed to be using the Sun as a compass to
determine direction. At the time, this idea seemed
preposterous. How could a bird navigate by the
Sun when some of us lose our way with road
maps? Obviously, more testing was in order.
So, in another set of experiments, Kramer put
identical food boxes around the cage, with food in
only one of the boxes. The boxes were stationary,
and the one containing food was always at the
same point of the compass. However, its position
with respect to the surroundings could be changed
by revolving either the inner cage containing the
birds or the outer walls, which served as the
background. As long as the birds could see the
Sun, no matter how their surroundings were
altered, they went directly to the correct food box.
Whether the box appeared in front of the right wall
or the left wall, they showed no signs of confusion.
On overcast days, however, the birds were
disoriented and had trouble locating their food box.
In experimenting with artificial suns, Kramer made
another interesting discovery. If the artificial Sun
remained stationary, the birds would shift their
direction with respect to it at a rate of about 15
degrees per hour, the Sun's rate of movement
across the sky. Apparently, the birds were
assuming that the "Sun" they saw was moving at
that rate. When the real Sun was visible, however,
the birds maintained a constant direction as it
moved across the sky. In other words, they were
able to compensate for the Sun's movement. This
meant that some sort of biological clock was
operating-and a very precise clock at that.
What about birds that migrate at night? Perhaps
they navigate by the night sky. To test the idea,
caged night-migrating birds were placed on the
floor of a planetarium during their migratory period.
A planetarium is essentially a theater with a
domelike ceiling onto which a night sky can be
projected for any night of the year. When the
planetarium sky matched the sky outside, the birds
fluttered in the direction of their normal migration.
But when the dome was rotated, the birds changed
their direction to match the artificial sky. The results
clearly indicated that the birds were orienting
according to the stars.
There is accumulating evidence indicating that
birds navigate by using a wide variety of
environmental cues. Other areas under
investigation include magnetism, landmarks,
coastlines, sonar, and even smells. The studies are
complicated by the fact that the data are
sometimes contradictory and the mechanisms
apparently change from time to time. Furthermore,
one sensory ability may back up another.
106
11 – 3 Begging by Nestlings
Many signals that animals make seem to impose
on the signalers costs that are overly damaging. A
classic example is noisy begging by nestling
songbirds when a parent returns to the nest with
food. These loud cheeps and peeps might give the
location of the nest away to a listening hawk or
raccoon, resulting in the death of the defenseless
nestlings. In fact, when tapes of begging tree
swallows were played at an artificial swallow nest
containing an egg, the egg in that “noisy” nest was
taken or destroyed by predators before the egg in a
nearby quiet nest in 29 of 37 trials.
Further evidence for the costs of begging comes
from a study of differences in the begging calls of
warbler species that nest on the ground versus
those that nest in the relative safety of trees. The
young of ground-nesting warblers produce begging
cheeps of higher frequencies than do their treenesting relatives. These higher-frequency sounds
do not travel as far, and so may better conceal the
individuals producing them, who are especially
vulnerable to predators in their ground nests. David
Haskell created artificial nests with clay eggs and
placed them on the ground beside a tape recorder
that played the begging calls of either tree-nesting
or of ground-nesting warblers. The eggs
“advertised” by the tree-nesters’ begging calls were
found bitten significantly more often than the eggs
associated with the ground-nesters’ calls.
The hypothesis that begging calls have evolved
properties that reduce their potential for attracting
predators yields a prediction: baby birds of species
that experience high rates of nest predation should
produce softer begging signals of higher frequency
than nestlings of other species less often victimized
by nest predators. This prediction was supported
by data collected in one survey of 24 species from
an Arizona forest, and more evidence that predator
pressure favors the evolution of begging calls that
are hard to detect and pinpoint.
Given that predators can make it costly to beg for
food, what benefit do begging nestlings derive from
their communications? One possibility is that a
noisy baby bird provides accurate signals of its real
hunger and good health, making it worthwhile for
the listening parent to give it food in a nest where
several other offspring are usually available to be
fed. If this hypothesis is true, then it follows that
nestlings should adjust the intensity of their signals
in relation to the signals produced by their
nestmates, who are competing for parental
attention. When experimentally deprived baby
robins are placed in a nest with normally fed
siblings, the hungry nestlings beg more loudly than
usual—but so do their better-fed siblings, though
not as loudly as the hungrier birds.
If parent birds use begging intensity to direct food
to healthy offspring capable of vigorous begging,
then parents should make food delivery decisions
on the basis of their offsprings’ calls. Indeed, if you
take baby tree swallows out of a nest for an hour
feeding half the set and starving the other half,
when the birds are replaced in the nest, the starved
youngsters beg more loudly than the fed birds, and
the parent birds feed the active beggars more than
those who beg less vigorously.
As these experiments show, begging apparently
provides a signal of need that parents use to make
judgments about which offspring can benefit most
from a feeding. But the question arises, why don’t
nestlings beg loudly when they aren’t all that
hungry? By doing so, they could possibly secure
more food, which should result in more rapid
growth or larger size, either of which is
advantageous. The answer lies apparently not in
the increased energy costs of exaggerated
begging—such energy costs are small relative to
the potential gain in calories—but rather in the
damage that any successful cheater would do to its
siblings, which share genes with one another. An
individual’s success in propagating his or her
genes can be affected by more than just his or her
own personal reproductive success. Because close
relatives have many of the same genes, animals
that harm their close relatives may in effect be
destroying some of their own genes. Therefore, a
begging nestling that secures food at the expense
of its siblings might actually leave behind fewer
copies of its genes overall than it might otherwise.
107
13 – 2 Biological Clocks
Survival and successful reproduction usually
require the activities of animals to be coordinated
with predictable events around them.
Consequently, the timing and rhythms of biological
functions must closely match periodic events like
the solar day, the tides, the lunar cycle, and the
seasons. The relations between animal activity and
these periods, particularly for the daily rhythms,
have been of such interest and importance that a
huge amount of work has been done on them and
the special research field of chronobiology has
emerged. Normally, the constantly changing levels
of an animal’s activity – sleeping, feeding, moving,
reproducing, metabolizing, and producing enzymes
and hormones, for example – are well coordinated
with environmental rhythms, but the key question is
whether the animal’s schedule is driven by external
cues, such as sunrise or sunset, or is instead
dependent somehow on internal timers that
themselves generate the observed biological
rhythms. Almost universally, biologists accept the
idea that all eukaryotes (a category that includes
most organisms except bacteria and certain algae)
have internal clocks. By isolating organisms
completely from external periodic cues, biologists
learned that organisms have internal clocks. For
instance, apparently normal daily periods of
biological activity were maintained for about a week
by the fungus Neurospora when it was intentionally
isolated from all geophysical timing cues while
orbiting in a space shuttle. The continuation of
biological rhythms in an organism without external
cues attests to its having an internal clock.
When crayfish are kept continuously in the dark,
even for four to five months, their compound eyes
continue to adjust on a daily schedule for daytime
and nighttime vision. Horseshoe crabs kept in the
dark continuously for a year were found to maintain
a persistent rhythm of brain activity that similarly
adapts their eyes on a daily schedule for bright or
for weak light. Like almost all daily cycles of
animals deprived of environmental cues, those
measured for the horseshoe crabs in these
conditions were not exactly 24 hours. Such a
rhythm whose period is approximately—but not
exactly – a day is called circadian. For different
individual horseshoe crabs, the circadian period
ranged from 22.2 to 25.5 hours. A particular animal
typically maintains its own characteristic cycle
duration with great precision for many days.
Indeed, stability of the biological clock’s period is
one of its major features, even when the
organism’s environment is subjected to
considerable changes in factors, such as
temperature, that would be expected to affect
biological activity strongly. Further evidence for
persistent internal rhythms appears when the usual
external cycles are shifted – either experimentally
or by rapid east-west travel over great distances.
Typically, the animal’s daily internally generated
cycle of activity continues without change. As a
result, its activities are shifted relative to the
external cycle of the new environment. The
disorienting effects of this mismatch between
external time cues and internal schedules may
persist, like our jet lag, for several days or weeks
until certain cues such as the daylight/darkness
cycle reset the organism’s clock to synchronize
with the daily rhythm of the new environment.
Animals need natural periodic signals like sunrise
to maintain a cycle whose period is precisely 24
hours. Such an external cue not only coordinates
an animal’s daily rhythms with particular features of
the local solar day but also—because it normally
does so day after day—seems to keep the internal
clock’s period close to that of Earth’s rotation. Yet
despite this synchronization of the period of the
internal cycle, the animal’s timer itself continues to
have its own genetically built-in period close to, but
different from, 24 hours. Without the external cue,
the difference accumulates and so the internally
regulated activities of the biological day drift
continuously, like the tides, in relation to the solar
day. This drift has been studied extensively in
many animals and in biological activities ranging
from the hatching of fruit fly eggs to wheel running
by squirrels. Light has a predominating influence in
setting the clock. Even a fifteen-minute burst of
light in otherwise sustained darkness can reset an
animal’s circadian rhythm. Normally, internal
rhythms are kept in step by regular environmental
cycles. For instance, if a homing pigeon is to
navigate with its Sun compass, its clock must be
properly set by cues provided by the
daylight/darkness cycle.
108
15 – 1 A Warm-Blooded Turtle
When it comes to physiology, the leatherback turtle
is, in some ways, more like a reptilian whale than a
turtle. It swims farther into the cold of the northern
and southern oceans than any other sea turtle, and
it deals with the chilly waters in a way unique
among reptiles.
A warm-blooded turtle may seem to be a
contradiction in terms. Nonetheless, an adult
leatherback can maintain a body temperature of
between 25 and 26°C (77-79°F) in seawater that is
only 8°C (46.4°F). Accomplishing this feat requires
adaptations both to generate heat in the turtle’s
body and to keep it from escaping into the
surrounding waters. Leatherbacks apparently do
not generate internal heat the way we do, or the
way birds do, as a by-product of cellular
metabolism. A leatherback may be able to pick up
some body heat by basking at the surface; its dark,
almost black body color may help it to absorb solar
radiation. However, most of its internal heat comes
from the action of its muscles.
Leatherbacks keep their body heat in three
different ways. The first, and simplest, is size. The
bigger the animal is, the lower its surface-to-volume
ratio; for every ounce of body mass, there is
proportionately less surface through which heat
can escape. An adult leather back is twice the size
of the biggest cheloniid sea turtles and will
therefore take longer to cool off. Maintaining a high
body temperature through sheer bulk is called
gigantothermy. It works for elephants, for whales,
and, perhaps, it worked for many of the larger
dinosaurs. It apparently works, in a smaller way, for
some other sea turtles. Large loggerhead and
green turtles can maintain their body temperature
at a degree or two above that of the surrounding
water, and gigantothermy is probably the way they
do it. Muscular activity helps, too, and an actively
swimming green turtle may be 7°C (12.6°F) warmer
than the waters it swims through.
Gigantothermy, though, would not be enough to
keep a leatherback warm in cold northern waters. It
is not enough for whales, which supplement it with
a thick layer of insulating blubber (fat).
Leatherbacks do not have blubber, but they do
have a reptilian equivalent: thick, oil-saturated skin,
with a layer of fibrous, fatty tissue just beneath it.
Insulation protects the leatherback everywhere but
on its head and flippers. Because the flippers are
comparatively thin and blade-like, they are the one
part of the leatherback that is likely to become
chilled. There is not much that the turtle can do
about this without compromising the aerodynamic
shape of the flipper. The problem is that as blood
flows through the turtle’s flippers, it risks losing
enough heat to lower the animal’s central body
temperature when it returns. The solution is to
allow the flippers to cool down without drawing heat
away from the rest of the turtle’s body. The
leatherback accomplishes this by arranging the
blood vessels in the base of its flipper into a
countercurrent exchange system.
In a countercurrent exchange system, the blood
vessels carrying cooled blood from the flippers run
close enough to the blood vessels carrying warm
blood from the body to pick up some heat from the
warmer blood vessels; thus, the heat is transferred
from the outgoing to the ingoing vessels before it
reaches the flipper itself. This is the same
arrangement found in an old-fashioned steam
radiator, in which the coiled pipes pass heat back
and forth as water courses through them. The
leatherback is certainly not the only animal with
such an arrangement; gulls have a countercurrent
exchange in their legs. That is why a gull can stand
on an ice floe without freezing.
All this applies, of course, only to an adult
leatherback. Hatchlings are simply too small to
conserve body heat, even with insulation and
countercurrent exchange systems. We do not know
how old, or how large, a leatherback has to be
before it can switch from a cold-blooded to a warmblooded mode of life. Leatherbacks reach their
immense size in a much shorter time than it takes
other sea turtles to grow. Perhaps their rush to
adulthood is driven by a simple need to keep warm.

17 – 2 Animal Signals in the Rain Forest
The daytime quality of light in forests varies with
the density of the vegetation, the angle of the Sun,
and the amount of cloud in the sky. Both animals
and plants have different appearances in these
various lighting conditions. A color or pattern that is
relatively indistinct in one kind of light may be quite
conspicuous in another.
In the varied and constantly changing light
environment of the forest, an animal must be able
to send visual signals to members of its own
species and at the same time avoid being detected
by predators. An animal can hide from predators by
choosing the light environment in which its pattern
is least visible. This may require moving to different
parts of the forest at different times of the day or
under different weather conditions, or it may be
achieved by changing color according to the
changing light conditions. Many species of
amphibians (frogs and toads) and reptiles (lizards
and snakes) are able to change their color patterns
to camouflage themselves. Some also signal by
changing color. The chameleon lizard has the most
striking ability to do this. Some chameleon species
can change from a rather dull appearance to a full
riot of carnival colors in seconds. By this means,
they signal their level of aggression or readiness to
mate.
Other species take into account the changing
conditions of light by performing their visual
displays only when the light is favorable. A male
bird of paradise may put himself in the limelight by
displaying his spectacular plumage in the best
stage setting to attract a female. Certain butterflies
move into spots of sunlight that have penetrated to
the forest floor and display by opening and closing
their beautifully patterned wings in the bright
spotlights. They also compete with each other for
the best spot of sunlight.
Very little light filters through the canopy of leaves
and branches in a rain forest to reach ground
level—or close to the ground—and at those levels
the yellow-to-green wavelengths predominate. A
signal might be most easily seen if it is maximally
bright. In the green-to-yellow lighting conditions of
the lowest levels of the forest, yellow and green
would be the brightest colors, but when an animal
is signaling, these colors would not be very visible if
the animal was sitting in an area with a yellowish or
greenish background. The best signal depends not
only on its brightness but also on how well it
contrasts with the background against which it must
be seen. In this part of the rain forest, therefore,
red and orange are the best colors for signaling,
and they are the colors used in signals by the
ground-walking Australian brush turkey. This
species, which lives in the rain forests and
scrublands of the east coast of Australia, has a
brown-to-black plumage with bare, bright-red skin
on the head and neck and a neck collar of orangeyellow loosely hanging skin. During courtship and
aggressive displays, the turkey enlarges its colored
neck collar by inflating sacs in the neck region and
then flings about a pendulous part of the colored
signaling apparatus as it utters calls designed to
attract or repel. This impressive display is clearly
visible in the light spectrum illuminating the forest
floor.
Less colorful birds and animals that inhabit the rain
forest tend to rely on other forms of signaling other
than the visual, particularly over long distances.
The piercing cries of the rhinoceros and hornbill
characterize the Southeast Asian rain forest, as do
the unmistakable calls of the gibbons. In densely
wooded environments, sound is the best means of
communication over distance because in
comparison with light, it travels with little
impediment from trees and other vegetation. In
forests, visual signals can be seen only at short
distances, where they are not obstructed by trees.
The male riflebird exploits both of these modes of
signaling simultaneously in his courtship display.
The sounds made as each wing is opened carry
extremely well over distance and advertise his
presence widely. The ritualized visual display
communicates in close quarters when a female has
approached.

17 – 3 Symbiotic Relationships
A symbiotic relationship is an interaction between
two or more species in which one species lives in
or on another species. There are three main types
of symbiotic relationships: parasitism,
commensalism, and mutualism. The first and the
third can be key factors in the structure of a
biological community; that is, all the populations of
organisms living together and potentially interacting
in a particular area.
Parasitism is a kind of predator-prey relationship in
which one organism, the parasite, derives its food
at the expense of its symbiotic associate, the host.
Parasites are usually smaller than their hosts. An
example of a parasite is a tapeworm that lives
inside the intestines of a larger animal and absorbs
nutrients from its host. Natural selection favors the
parasites that are best able to find and feed on
hosts. At the same time, defensive abilities of hosts
are also selected for. As an example, plants make
chemicals toxic to fungal and bacterial parasites,
along with ones toxic to predatory animals
(sometimes they are the same chemicals). In
vertebrates, the immune system provides a multiple
defense against internal parasites.
At times, it is actually possible to watch the effects
of natural selection in host-parasite relationships.
For example, Australia during the 1940 s was
overrun by hundreds of millions of European
rabbits. The rabbits destroyed huge expanses of
Australia and threatened the sheep and cattle
industries. In 1950, myxoma virus, a parasite that
affects rabbits, was deliberately introduced into
Australia to control the rabbit population. Spread
rapidly by mosquitoes, the virus devastated the
rabbit population. The virus was less deadly to the
offspring of surviving rabbits, however, and it
caused less and less harm over the years.
Apparently, genotypes (the genetic make-up of an
organism) in the rabbit population were selected
that were better able to resist the parasite.
Meanwhile, the deadliest strains of the virus
perished with their hosts as natural selection
favored strains that could infect hosts but not kill
them. Thus, natural selection stabilized this hostparasite relationship.
In contrast to parasitism, in commensalism, one
partner benefits without significantly affecting the
other. Few cases of absolute commensalism
probably exist, because it is unlikely that one of the
partners will be completely unaffected. Commensal
associations sometimes involve one species'
obtaining food that is inadvertently exposed by
another. For instance, several kinds of birds feed
on insects flushed out of the grass by grazing
cattle. It is difficult to imagine how this could affect
the cattle, but the relationship may help or hinder
them in some way not yet recognized.
The third type of symbiosis, mutualism, benefits
both partners in the relationship. Legume plants
and their nitrogen-fixing bacteria, and the
interactions between flowering plants and their
pollinators, are examples of mutualistic association.
In the first case, the plants provide the bacteria with
carbohydrates and other organic compounds, and
the bacteria have enzymes that act as catalysts
that eventually add nitrogen to the soil, enriching it.
In the second case, pollinators (insects, birds)
obtain food from the flowering plant, and the plant
has its pollen distributed and seeds dispersed
much more efficiently than they would be if they
were carried by the wind only. Another example of
mutualism would be the bull's horn acacia tree,
which grows in Central and South America. The
tree provides a place to live for ants of the genus
Pseudomyrmex. The ants live in large, hollow
thorns and eat sugar secreted by the tree. The ants
also eat yellow structures at the tip of leaflets:
these are protein rich and seem to have no function
for the tree except to attract ants. The ants benefit
the host tree by attacking virtually anything that
touches it. They sting other insects and large
herbivores (animals that eat only plants) and even
clip surrounding vegetation that grows near the
tree. When the ants are removed, the trees usually
die, probably because herbivores damage them so
much that they are unable to compete with
surrounding vegetation for light and growing space.
The complex interplay of species in symbiotic
relationships highlights an important point about
communities: Their structure depends on a web of
diverse connections among organisms.

20 – 3 Fossil Preservation
When one considers the many ways by which
organisms are completely destroyed after death, it
is remarkable that fossils are as common as they
are. Attack by scavengers and bacteria, chemical
decay, and destruction by erosion and other
geologic agencies make the odds against
preservation very high. However, the chances of
escaping complete destruction are vastly improved
if the organism happens to have a mineralized
skeleton and dies in a place where it can be quickly
buried by sediment. Both of these conditions are
often found on the ocean floors, where shelled
invertebrates (organisms without spines) flourish
and are covered by the continuous rain of
sedimentary particles. Although most fossils are
found in marine sedimentary rocks, they also are
found in terrestrial deposits left by streams and
lakes. On occasion, animals and plants have been
preserved after becoming immersed in tar or
quicksand, trapped in ice or lava flows, or engulfed
by rapid falls of volcanic ash.
The term "fossil" often implies petrifaction, literally a
transformation into stone. After the death of an
organism, the soft tissue is ordinarily consumed by
scavengers and bacteria. The empty shell of a snail
or clam may be left behind, and if it is sufficiently
durable and resistant to dissolution, it may remain
basically unchanged for a long period of time.
Indeed, unaltered shells of marine invertebrates
are known from deposits over 100 million years old.
In many marine creatures, however, the skeleton is
composed of a mineral variety of calcium carbonate
called aragonite. Although aragonite has the same
composition as the more familiar mineral known as
calcite, it has a different crystal form, is relatively
unstable, and in time changes to the more stable
calcite.
Many other processes may alter the shell of a clam
or snail and enhance its chances for preservation.
Water containing dissolved silica, calcium
carbonate, or iron may circulate through the
enclosing sediment and be deposited in cavities
such as marrow cavities and canals in bone once
occupied by blood vessels and nerves. In such
cases, the original composition of the bone or shell
remains, but the fossil is made harder and more
durable. This addition of a chemically precipitated
substance into pore spaces is termed
"permineralization."
Petrifaction may also involve a simultaneous
exchange of the original substance of a dead plant
or animal with mineral matter of a different
composition. This process is termed “replacement”
because solutions have dissolved the original
material and replaced it with an equal volume of
the new substance. Replacement can be a
marvelously precise process, so that details of shell
ornamentation, tree rings in wood, and delicate
structures in bone are accurately preserved.
Another type of fossilization, known as
carbonization, occurs when soft tissues are
preserved as thin films of carbon. Leaves and
tissue of soft-bodied organisms such as jellyfish or
worms may accumulate, become buried and
compressed, and lose their volatile constituents.
The carbon often remains behind as a blackened
silhouette.
Although it is certainly true that the possession of
hard parts enhances the prospect of preservation,
organisms having soft tissues and organs are also
occasionally preserved. Insects and even small
invertebrates have been found preserved in the
hardened resins of conifers and certain other trees.
X-ray examination of thin slabs of rock sometimes
reveals the ghostly outlines of tentacles, digestive
tracts, and visual organs of a variety of marine
creatures. Soft parts, including skin, hair, and
viscera of ice age mammoths, have been
preserved in frozen soil or in the oozing tar of oil
seeps.
The probability that actual remains of soft tissue will
be preserved is improved if the organism dies in an
environment of rapid deposition and oxygen
deprivation. Under such conditions, the destructive
effects of bacteria are diminished. The Middle
Eocene Messel Shale (from about 48 million years
ago) of Germany accumulated in such an
environment. The shale was deposited in an
oxygen-deficient lake where lethal gases
sometimes bubbled up and killed animals. Their
remains accumulated on the floor of the lake and
were then covered by clay and silt. Among the
superbly preserved Messel fossils are insects with
iridescent exoskeletons (hard outer coverings),
frogs with skin and blood vessels intact, and even
entire small mammals with preserved fur and soft
tissue.

26 – 2 Survival of Plants and Animals in Desert
Conditions
The harsh conditions in deserts are intolerable for
most plants and animals. Despite these conditions,
however, many varieties of plants and animals
have adapted to deserts in a number of ways. Most
plant tissues die if their water content falls too low:
the nutrients that feed plants are transmitted by
water; water is a raw material in the vital process of
photosynthesis; and water regulates the
temperature of a plant by its ability to absorb heat
and because water vapor lost to the atmosphere
through the leaves helps to lower plant
temperatures. Water controls the volume of plant
matter produced. The distribution of plants within
different areas of desert is also controlled by water.
Some areas, because of their soil texture,
topographical position, or distance from rivers or
groundwater, have virtually no water available to
plants, whereas others do.
The nature of plant life in deserts is also highly
dependent on the fact that they have to adapt to
the prevailing aridity. There are two general classes
of vegetation: long-lived perennials, which may be
succulent (water-storing) and are often dwarfed
and woody, and annuals or ephemerals, which
have a short life cycle and may form a fairly dense
stand immediately after rain.
The ephemeral plants evade drought. Given a year
of favorable precipitation, such plants will develop
vigorously and produce large numbers of flowers
and fruit. This replenishes the seed content of the
desert soil. The seeds then lie dormant until the
next wet year, when the desert blooms again.
The perennial vegetation adjusts to the aridity by
means of various avoidance mechanisms. Most
desert plants are probably best classified as
xerophytes. They possess drought-resisting
adaptations: loss of water through the leaves is
reduced by means of dense hairs covering waxy
leaf surfaces, by the closure of pores during the
hottest times to reduce water loss, and by the
rolling up or shedding of leaves at the beginning of
the dry season. Some xerophytes, the succulents
(including cacti), store water in their structures.
Another way of countering drought is to have a
limited amount of mass above ground and to have
extensive root networks below ground. It is not
unusual for the roots of some desert perennials to
extend downward more than ten meters. Some
plants are woody in type — an adaptation designed
to prevent collapse of the plant tissue when water
stress produces wilting. Another class of desert
plant is the phreatophyte. These have adapted to
the environment by the development of long
taproots that penetrate downward until they
approach the assured water supply provided by
groundwater. Among these plants are the date
palm, tamarisk, and mesquite. They commonly
grow near stream channels, springs, or on the
margins of lakes.
Animals also have to adapt to desert conditions,
and they may do it through two forms of behavioral
adaptation: they either escape or retreat. Escape
involves such actions as aestivation, a condition of
prolonged dormancy, or torpor, during which
animals reduce their metabolic rate and body
temperature during the hot season or during very
dry spells.
Seasonal migration is another form of escape,
especially for large mammals or birds. The term
retreat is applied to the short-term escape behavior
of desert animals, and it usually assumes the
pattern of a daily rhythm. Birds shelter in nests,
rock overhangs, trees, and dense shrubs to avoid
the hottest hours of the day, while mammals like
the kangaroo rat burrow underground.
Some animals have behavioral, physiological, and
morphological (structural) adaptations that enable
them to withstand extreme conditions. For
example, the ostrich has plumage that is so
constructed that the feathers are long but not too
dense. When conditions are hot, the ostrich erects
them on its back, thus increasing the thickness of
the barrier between solar radiation and the skin.
The sparse distribution of the feathers, however,
also allows considerable lateral air movement over
the skin surface, thereby permitting further heat
loss by convection. Furthermore, the birds orient
themselves carefully with regard to the Sun and
gently flap their wings to increase convection
cooling.
113
27 – 3 Predator-Prey Cycles
How do predators affect populations of the prey
animals? The answer is not as simple as might be
thought. Moose reached Isle Royale in Lake
Superior by crossing over winter ice and multiplied
freely there in isolation without predators. When
wolves later reached the island, naturalists widely
assumed that the wolves would play a key role in
controlling the moose population. Careful studies
have demonstrated, however, that this is not the
case. The wolves eat mostly old or diseased
animals that would not survive long anyway. In
general, the moose population is controlled by food
availability, disease and other factors rather than
by wolves.
When experimental populations are set up under
simple laboratory conditions, the predator often
exterminates its prey and then becomes extinct
itself, having nothing left to eat. However, if safe
areas like those prey animals have in the wild are
provided, the prey population drops to low level but
not extinction. Low prey population levels then
provide inadequate food for the predators, causing
the predator population to decrease. When this
occurs, the prey population can rebound. In this
situation the predator and prey population may
continue in this cyclical pattern for some time.
Population cycles are characteristic of small
mammals, and they sometimes appear to be
brought about by predators. Ecologists studying
hare populations have found that the North
American snow shoe hare follows a roughly tenyear cycle. Its numbers fall tenfold to thirty in a
typical cycle, and a hundredfold change can occur.
Two factors appear to be generating the cycle: food
plants and predators.
The preferred foods of snowshoe hares are willow
and birch twigs. As hare density increases, the
quantity of these twigs decreases, forcing the hares
to feed on low-quality high-fiber food. Lower birth
rates, low juvenile survivorship, and low growth
rates follow, so there is a corresponding decline in
hare abundance. Once the hare population has
declined, it takes two to three year for the quantity
of twigs to recover.
A key predator of the snowshoe hare is the Canada
lynx. The Canada lynx shows a ten-year cycle of
abundance that parallels the abundance cycle of
hares. As hare numbers fall, so do lynx numbers,
as their food supply depleted.
What causes the predator-prey oscillations? Do
increasing number of hares lead to overharvesting
of plants, which in turn results in reduced hare
populations, or do increasing numbers of lynx lead
to overharvesting hares? Field experiments carried
out by Charles Krebs and coworkers in 1992
provide an answer. Krebs investigated
experimental plots in Canada's Yukon territory that
contained hare populations. When food was added
to those plots (no food effect) and predators were
excluded (no predator effect) from an experimental
area, hare numbers increased tenfold and stayed
there - the cycle was lost. However, the cycle was
retained if either of the factors was allowed to
operate alone: if predators were excluded but food
was not added (food effect alone), or if food was
added in the presence of predators (predator effect
alone). Thus both factors can affect the cycle,
which, in practice, seems to be generated by
conjunction of the two factors.
Predators are an essential factor in maintaining
communities that are rich and diverse in species.
Without predators, the species that is the best
competitor for food, shelter, nesting sites, and other
environmental resources tends to dominate and
exclude the species with which it competes. This
phenomenon is known as "competitor exclusion".
However, if the community contains a predator of
the strongest competitor species, then the
population of that competitor is controlled. Thus
even the less competitive species are able to
survive. For example, sea stars prey on a variety of
bivalve mollusks and prevent these bivalves from
monopolizing habitats on the sea floor. This opens
up space for many other organisms. When sea
stars are removed, species diversity falls sharply.
Therefore, from the stand point of diversity, it is
usually a mistake to eliminate a major predator
from a community.
114
28 – 3 Buck Rubs and Buck Scrapes
A conspicuous sign indicating the presence of
white-tailed deer in a woodlot is a buck rub. A male
deer makes a buck rub by striping the bark (outer
layer) of a small tree with its antlers. When
completed, the buck rub is an obvious visual signal
to us and presumable to other deer in the area. A
rub is usually located at the shoulder height of a
deer (one meter or less above the ground) on a
smooth-barked, small-diameter (16-25 millimeters)
tree. The smooth bark of small red maples makes
this species ideal for buck rubs in the forests of the
mid-eastern United States.
Adult male deer usually produce rubs in late
summer or early autumn when the outer velvet
layer is being shed from their antlers. Rubs are
created about one to two months before the
breeding season (the rut). Hence for a long time
biologists believed that male deer used buck rubs
not only to clean and polish antlers but also to
provide practice for the ensuing male-to-male
combat during the rut. However, biologists also
noted deer sniff and lick an unfamiliar rub, which
suggests that this visual mark on a small tree plays
an important communication purpose in the social
life of deer.
Buck rubs also have a scent produced by glands in
the foreheads of deer that is transferred to the tree
when the rub is made. These odors make buck
rubs an important means of olfactory
communication between deer. The importance of
olfactory communication (using odors to
communicate) in the way of life of deer was
documented by a study of captive adult male deer
a few decades ago, which noted that males rubbed
their foreheads on branches and twigs, especially
as autumn approached. A decade later another
study reported that adult male white-tailed deer
exhibited forehead rubbing just before and during
the rut. It was found that when a white-tailed buck
makes a rub, it moves both antlers and forehead
glands along the small tree in a vertical direction.
This forehead rubbing behavior coincides with a
high level of glandular activity in the modified scent
glands found on the foreheads of male deer; the
glandular activity causes the forehead pelage
(hairy covering) of adult males to be distinctly
darker than in females or younger males.
Forehead rubbing by male deer on buck rubs
presumably sends a great deal of information to
other members of the same species. First, the
chemicals deposited on the rub provide information
on the individual identity of an animal; no two
mammals produce the same scent. For instance,
as we all know, dogs recognize each other via
smell. Second, because only male deer rub, the
buck rub and its associated chemicals indicate the
sex of the deer producing the rub. Third, older,
more dominant bucks produce more buck rubs and
probably deposit more glandular secretions on a
given rub. Thus the presence of many well-marked
rubs is indicative of older, higher-status males
being in the general vicinity rather than simply
being a crude measure of relative deer abundance
in a given area. The information conveyed by the
olfactory signals on a buck rub make it the social
equivalent of some auditory signals in other deer
species, such as trumpeting by bull elk.
Because both sexes of white-tailed respond to
buck rubs by smelling and licking them, rubs may
serve a very important additional function. Fresher
buck rubs (less than two days old), in particular, are
visited more frequently by adult females than older
rubs. In view of this behavior it has been suggested
that chemicals present in fresh buck rubs may help
physiologically induce and synchronize fertility in
females that visit these rubs. This would be an
obvious advantage to wide-ranging deer, especially
to a socially dominant buck when courting several
adult females during the autumn rut. Another visual
signal produced by white-tailed deer is termed a
buck scrape. Scrapes consist of a clearing (about
0.5 meter in diameter) and shallow depression
made by pushing aside the leaves covering the
ground; after making the scrape, the deer typically
urinates in the depression. Thus, like a buck rub, a
scrape is both a visual and an olfactory signal.
Buck scrapes are generally created after leaf-fall in
autumn, which is just before or during the rut.
Scrapes are usually placed in open or conspicuous
places, such as along a deer trail. Most are made
by older males, although females and younger
males (2.5 years old or less) occasionally make
scrapes.
115
29 – 2 Competition
When several individuals of the same species or of
several different species depend on the same
limited resource, a situation may arise that is
referred to as competition. The existence of
competition has been long known to naturalists; its
effects were described by Darwin in considerable
detail. Competition among individuals of the same
species (intraspecies competition), one of the major
mechanisms of natural selection, is the concern of
evolutionary biology. Competition among the
individuals of different species (interspecies
competition) is a major concern of ecology. It is one
of the factors controlling the size of competing
populations, and extreme cases it may lead to the
extinction of one of the competing species. This
was described by Darwin for indigenous New
Zealand species of animals and plants, which died
out when competing species from Europe were
introduced.
No serious competition exists when the major
needed resource is in superabundant supply, as in
most cases of the coexistence of herbivores (plant
eaters). Furthermore, most species do not depend
entirely on a single resource, if the major resource
for a species becomes scarce, the species can
usually shift to alternative resources. If more than
one species is competing for a scarce resource, the
competing species usually switch to different
alternative resources. Competition is usually most
severe among close relatives with similar demands
on the environment. But it may also occur among
totally unrelated forms that compete for the same
resource, such as seed-eating rodents and ants.
The effects of such competition are graphically
demonstrated when all the animals or all the plants
in an ecosystem come into competition, as
happened 2 million years ago at the end of
Pliocene, when North and South America became
joined by the Isthmus of Panama. North and South
American species migrating across the Isthmus
now came into competition with each other. The
result was the extermination of a large fraction of
the South American mammals, which were
apparently unable to withstand the competition
from invading North American species - although
added predation was also an important factor.
To what extent competition determines the
composition of a community and the density of
particular species has been the source of
considerable controversy. The problem is that
competition ordinarily cannot be observed directly
but must be inferred from the spread or increase of
one species and the concurrent reduction or
disappearance of another species. The Russian
biologist G. F. Gause performed numerous twospecies experiments in the laboratory, in which one
of the species became extinct when only a single
kind of resource was available. On the basis of
these experiments and of field observations, the
so-called law of competitive exclusion was
formulated, according to which no two species can
occupy the same niche. Numerous seeming
exceptions to this law have since been found, but
they can usually be explained as cases in which
the two species, even though competing for a
major joint resource, did not really occupy exactly
the same niche.
Competition among species is of considerable
evolutionary importance. The physical structure of
species competing for resources in the same
ecological niche tends to gradually evolve in ways
that allow them to occupy different niches.
Competing species also tend to change their
ranges so that their territories no longer overlap.
The evolutionary effect of competition on species
has been referred to as "species selection";
however, this description is potentially misleading.
Only the individuals of a species are subject to the
pressures of natural selection. The effect on the
well-being and existence of a species is just the
result of the effects of selection on all the
individuals of the species. Thus species selection is
actually a result of individual selection.
Competition may occur for any needed resource. In
the case of animals it is usually food; in the case of
forest plants it may be light; in the case of substrate
inhabitants it may be space, as in many shallowwater bottom-dwelling marine organisms. Indeed, it
may be for any of the factors, physical as well as
biotic, that are essential for organisms. Competition
is usually the more severe the denser the
population. Together with predation, it is the most
important density-dependent factor in regulating
population growth.
116
30 – 2 The Pace of Evolutionary Change
A heated debate has enlivened recent studies of
evolution. Darwin’s original thesis, and the
viewpoint supported by evolutionary gradualists, is
that species change continuously but slowly and in
small increments. Such changes are all but
invisible over the short time scale of modern
observations, and, it is argued, they are usually
obscured by innumerable gaps in the imperfect
fossil record. Gradualism, with its stress on the
slow pace of change, is a comforting position,
repeated over and over again in generations of
textbooks. By the early twentieth century, the
question about the rate of evolution had been
answered in favor of gradualism to most biologists’
satisfaction.
Sometimes a closed question must be reopened as
new evidence or new arguments based on old
evidence come to light. In 1972 paleontologists
Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge challenged
conventional wisdom with an opposing viewpoint,
the punctuated equilibrium hypothesis, which posits
that species give rise to new species in relatively
sudden bursts, without a lengthy transition period.
These episodes of rapid evolution are separated by
relatively long static spans during which a species
may hardly change at all.
The punctuated equilibrium hypothesis attempts to
explain a curious feature of the fossil record — one
that has been familiar to paleontologists for more
than a century but has usually been ignored. Many
species appear to remain unchanged in the fossil
record for millions of years — a situation that
seems to be at odds with Darwin’s model of
continuous change. Intermediate fossil forms,
predicted by gradualism, are typically lacking. In
most localities a given species of clam or coral
persists essentially unchanged throughout a thick
formation of rock, only to be replaced suddenly by
a new and different species.
The evolution of North American horse, which was
once presented as a classic textbook example of
gradual evolution, is now providing equally
compelling evidence for punctuated equilibrium. A
convincing 50-million-year sequence of modern
horse ancestors — each slightly larger, with more
complex teeth, a longer face, and a more
prominent central toe — seemed to provide strong
support for Darwin’s contention that species evolve
gradually. But close examination of those fossil
deposits now reveals a somewhat different story.
Horses evolved in discrete steps, each of which
persisted almost unchanged for millions of years
and was eventually replaced by a distinctive newer
model. The four-toed Eohippus preceded the threetoed Miohippus, for example, but North American
fossil evidence suggests a jerky, uneven transition
between the two. If evolution had been a
continuous, gradual process, one might expect that
almost every fossil specimen would be slightly
different from every year.
If it seems difficult to conceive how major changes
could occur rapidly, consider this: an alteration of a
single gene in files is enough to turn a normal fly
with a single pair of wings into one that has two
pairs of wings.
The question about the rate of evolution must now
be turned around: does evolution ever proceed
gradually, or does it always occur in short bursts?
Detailed field studies of thick rock formations
containing fossils provide the best potential tests of
the competing theories.
Occasionally, a sequence of fossil-rich layers of
rock permits a comprehensive look at one type of
organism over a long period of time. For example,
Peter Sheldon’s studies of trilobites, a now extinct
marine animal with a segmented body, offer a
detailed glimpse into three million years of
evolution in one marine environment. In that study,
each of eight different trilobite species was
observed to undergo a gradual change in the
number of segments — typically an increase of one
or two segments over the whole time interval. No
significant discontinuous were observed, leading
Sheldon to conclude that environmental conditions
were quite stable during the period he examined.
Similar exhaustive studies are required for many
different kinds of organisms from many different
periods. Most researchers expect to find that both
modes of transition from one species to another
are at work in evolution. Slow, continuous change
may be the norm during periods of environmental
stability, while rapid evolution of new species
occurs during periods of environment stress. But a
lot more studies like Sheldon’s are needed before
we can say for sure.
117
32 – 3 Distributions of Tropical Bee Colonies
In 1977 ecologists Stephen Hubbell and Leslie
Johnson recorded a dramatic example of how
social interactions can produce and enforce regular
spacing in a population. They studied competition
and nest spacing in populations of stingless bees in
tropical dry forests in Costa Rica. Though these
bees do no sting, rival colonies of some species
fight fiercely over potential nesting sites.
Stingless bees are abundant in tropical and
subtropical environments, where they gather nectar
and pollen from a wide variety of flowers. They
generally nest in trees and live in colonies made up
of hundreds to thousands of workers. Hubbell and
Johnson observed that some species of stingless
bees are highly aggressive to members of their
species from other colonies, while other species
are not. Aggressive species usually forage in
groups and feed mainly on flowers that occur in
high-density clumps. Nonaggressive species feed
singly or in small groups and on more widely
distributed flowers.
Hubbell and Johnson studied several species of
stingless bees to determine whether there is a
relationship between aggressiveness and patterns
of colony distribution. They predicted that the
colonies of aggressive species would show regular
distributions, while those of nonaggressive species
would show random or closely grouped (clumped)
distribution. They concentrated their studies on a
thirteen-hectare tract of tropical dry forest that
contained numerous nests of nine species of
stingless bees.
Though Hubbell and Johnson were interested in
how bee behavior might affect colony distributions,
they recognized that the availability of potential
nest sites for colonies could also affect
distributions. So as one of the first steps in their
study, they mapped the distributions of trees
suitable for nesting. They found that potential nest
trees were distributed randomly through the study
area. They also found that the number of potential
nest sites was much greater than the number of
bee colonies. What did these measurements show
the researchers? The number of colonies in the
study area was not limited by availability of suitable
trees, and a clumped or regular distribution of
colonies was not due to an underlying clumped or
regular distribution of potential nest sites.
Hubbell and Johnson mapped the nests of five of
the nine species of stingless bees accurately, and
the nests of four of these species were distributed
regularly. All four species with regular nest
distributions were highly aggressive to bees from
other colonies of their own species. The fifth
species was not aggressive, and its nests were
randomly distributed over the study area.
The researchers also studied the process by which
the aggressive species establish new colonies.
Their observations provide insights into the
mechanisms that establish and maintain the
regular nest distribution of these species.
Aggressive species apparently mark prospective
nest sites with pheromones, chemical substances
secreted by some animals for communication with
other members of their species. The pheromone
secreted by these stingless bees attracts and
aggregates members of their colony to the
prospective nest site; however, it also attracts
workers from other nests.
If workers from two different colonies arrive at the
prospective nest at the same time, they may fight
for possession. Fights may be escalated into
protracted battles. The researchers observed
battles over a nest tree that lasted for two weeks.
Each dawn, fifteen to thirty workers from two
competing colonies arrived at the contested nest
site. The workers from the two colonies faced off in
two swarms and displayed and fought with each
other. In the displays, pairs of bees faced each
other, slowly flew vertically to a height of about
three meters, and then grappled each other to the
ground. When the two bees hit the ground, they
separated, faced off, and performed another aerial
display. Bees did not appear to be injured in these
fights, which were apparently ritualized. The two
swarms abandoned the battle at about 8 or 9 A.M.
each morning, only to re-form and begin again the
next day just after dawn. While this contest over an
unoccupied nest site produced no obvious
mortality, fights over occupied nests sometimes kill
over 1,000 bees in a single battle.

33 – 3 Extinction Episodes of the Past
It was not until the Cambrian period, beginning
about 600 million years ago, that a great
proliferation of macroscopic species occurred on
Earth and produced a fossil record that allows us to
track the rise and fall of biodiversity. Since the
Cambrian period, biodiversity has generally risen,
but there have been some notable exceptions.
Biodiversity collapsed dramatically during at least
five periods because of mass extinctions around
the globe. The five major mass extinctions receive
most of the attention, but they are only one end of
a spectrum of extinction events. Collectively, more
species went extinct during smaller events that
were less dramatic but more frequent. The best
known of the five major extinction events, the one
that saw the demise of the dinosaurs, is the
Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction.
Starting about 280 million years ago, reptiles were
the dominant large animals in terrestrial
environments. In popular language this was the era
"when dinosaurs ruled Earth", when a wide variety
of reptile species occupying many ecological
niches. However, no group or species can maintain
its dominance indefinitely, and when, after over 200
million years, the age of dinosaurs came to a
dramatic end about 65 million years ago, mammals
began to flourish, evolving from relatively few types
of small terrestrial animals into the myriad of
diverse species, including bats and whales, that we
know today. Paleontologists label this point in
Earth's history as the end of the Cretaceous period
and the beginning of the Tertiary period, often
abbreviated as the K-T boundary. This time was
also marked by changes in many other types of
organisms. Overall, about 38 percent of the families
of marine animals were lost, with percentages
much higher in some groups Ammonoid mollusks
went from being very diverse and abundant to
being extinct. An extremely abundant set of
planktonic marine animals called foraminifera
largely disappeared, although they rebounded
later. Among plants, the K-T boundary saw a sharp
but brief rise in the abundance of primitive vascular
plants such as ferns, club mosses, horsetails, and
conifers and other gymnosperms. The number of
flowering plants (angiosperms) was reduced at this
time, but they then began to increase dramatically.
What caused these changes? For many years
scientists assumed that a cooling of the climate
was responsible, with dinosaurs being particularly
vulnerable because, like modern reptiles, they were
ectothermic (dependent on environmental heat, or
cold-blooded). It is now widely believed that at least
some species of dinosaurs had a metabolic rate
high enough for them to be endotherms (animals
that maintain a relatively consistent body
temperature by generating heat internally).
Nevertheless, climatic explanations for the K-T
extinction are not really challenged by the ideas
that dinosaurs may have been endothermic,
because even endotherms can be affected by a
significant change in the climate.
Explanations for the K-T extinction were
revolutionized in 1980 when a group of physical
scientists led by Luis Alvarez proposed that 65
million years ago Earth was stuck by a 10-
kilometer-wide meteorite traveling at 90,000
kilometers per hour. They believed that this impact
generated a thick cloud of dust that enveloped
Earth, shutting out much of the incoming solar
radiation and reducing plant photosynthesis to very
low levels. Short-term effects might have included
huge tidal waves and extensive fires. In other
words, a series of events arising from a single
cataclysmic event caused the massive extinctions.
Initially, the meteorite theory was based on a single
line of evidence. At locations around the globe,
geologists had found an unusually high
concentration of iridium in the layer of sedimentary
rocks that was formed about 65 million years ago.
Iridium is an element that is usually uncommon
near Earth's surface, but it is abundant in some
meteorites. Therefore, Alvarez and his colleagues
concluded that it was likely that the iridium in
sedimentary rocks deposited at the K-T boundary
had originated in a giant meteorite or asteroid.
Most scientist came to accept the meteorite theory
after evidence came to light that a circular
formation, 180 kilometers in diameter and centered
on the north coast of the Yucatan Peninsula, was
created by a meteorite impact about 65 million
years ago.

35 – 3 Seasonal Succession in Phytoplankton
Phytoplankton are minute, free-floating aquatic
plants. In addition to the marked changes in
abundance observed in phytoplankton over the
course of a year, there is also a marked change in
species composition. This change in the dominant
species from season to season is called seasonal
succession, and it occurs in a wide variety of
locations. Under seasonal succession, one or more
species dominate the phytoplankton for a shorter or
longer period of time and then are replaced by
another set of species. This pattern is repeated
yearly. This succession is different from typical
terrestrial ecological succession in which various
plants replace one another until finally a so-called
climax community develops, which persists for
many years.
What are the factors causing this phenomenon?
Considering that seasonal succession is most often
and clearly seen in temperate seas, which have a
marked change in temperature during a year,
temperature has been suggested as a cause. This
may be one of the factors, but it is unlikely to be the
sole cause because there are species that become
dominant species at various temperatures.
Furthermore, temperature changes rather slowly in
seawater, and the replacement of dominant
species often is much more rapid.
Another suggested reason is the change in nutrient
level over the year, with differing concentrations
favoring different phytoplanklon species. While this
factor may also contribute, observations suggest
that phytoplankton populations rise and fall much
more quickly than nutrient concentrations change.
Yet another explanation is that species succession
is a consequence of changes in seawater brought
about by the phytoplankton living in it. Each
species of phytoplankton secretes or excretes
organic molecules into the seawater. These
metabolites can have an effect on the organisms
living in the seawater, either inhibiting or promoting
their growth. For any individual organism, the
amount of metabolite secreted is small. But the
effect of secretions by all the individuals of the
dominant species can be significant both for
themselves and for other species.
These organic metabolites could, and probably do,
include a number of different classes of organic
compounds. Some are likely toxins, such as those
released by the dinoflagellates (a species of
plankton) during red tides, which inhibit growth of
other photosynthetic organisms. In such cases, the
population explosion of dinoflagellates is so great
that the water becomes brownish red in color from
the billions of dinoflagellate cells. Although each
cell secretes a minute amount of toxin, the massive
dinoflagellate numbers cause the toxin to reach
concentrations that kill many creatures. This toxin
can be concentrated in such filter-feeding
organisms as clams and mussels, rendering them
toxic to humans.
Another class of metabolite is the vitamins. It is
now known that certain phytoplankton species
have requirements for certain vitamins, and that
there are considerable differences among species
as to requirements. The B vitamins, especially
vitamin B12, thiamine and biotin, seem to be the
most generally required. Some species may be
unable to thrive until a particular vitamin, or group
of vitamins, is present in the water. These vitamins
are produced only by another species: hence, a
succession of species could occur whereby first the
vitamin-producing species is present and then the
vitamin-requiring species follows.
Other organic compounds that may inhibit or
promote various species include amino acids,
carbohydrates, and fatty acids. Although it is
suspected that these organic metabolites may have
an important role in species succession and it has
been demonstrated in the laboratory that
phytoplankton species vary both in their ability to
produce necessary vitamins and in their
requirements for such in order to grow, evidence is
still inadequate as to their real role in the sea.
There is also evidence to suggest that grazers
(animals that feed on plants or stationary animals),
particularly selective grazers, can influence the
phytoplankton species composition. Many
copepods (small, herbivorous crustaceans) and
invertebrate larvae pick out selected phytoplankton
species from mixed groups, changing the species
composition.
A growing body of evidence now suggests that all
of the factors considered here are operating
simultaneously to produce species succession. The
importance of any factor will vary with the particular
phytoplankton species and the environmental
conditions.
120
37 – 2 Direct Species Translocation
It is becoming increasingly common for
conservationists to move individual animals or
entire species from one site to another. This may
be either to establish a new population where a
population of conspecifics (animals or plants
belonging to the same species) has become extinct
or to add individuals to an existing population. The
former is termed reintroduction and the latter
reinforcement. In both cases, wild individuals are
captured in one location and translocated directly
to another.
Direct translocation has been used a wide range of
plants and animals and was carried out to maintain
populations as a source of food long before
conservation was a familiar term. The number of
translocations carried out under the banner of
conservation has increased rapidly, and this has
led to criticism of the technique because of the lack
of evaluation of its efficacy and because of its
potential disadvantages. The nature of
translocation ranges from highly organized and
researched national or international programs to ad
hoc releases of rescued animals by wellintentioned animal lovers. In a fragmented
landscape where many populations and habitats
are isolated from others, translocations can play an
effective role in conservation strategies; they can
increase the number of existing populations or
increase the size, genetic diversity, and
demographic balance of a small population,
consequently increasing its chances of survival.
Translocation clearly has a role in the recovery of
species that have substantially declined and is the
most likely method by which many sedentary
species can recover all or part of their former
range. However, against this is the potential for
reinforcement translocations to spread disease
from one population to another or to introduce
deleterious or maladaptive genes to a population.
Additionally, translocation of predators or
competitors may have negative impacts on other
species, resulting in an overall loss of diversity.
Last but not least of these considerations is the
effort and resources required in this type of action,
which need to be justified by evidence of the likely
benefits.
Despite the large number of translocations that
have taken place, there is surprisingly little
evidence of the efficacy of such actions. This is
partly because many translocations have not been
strictly for conservation; neither have they been
official nor legal, let alone scientific in their
approach. Successful translocations inevitably get
recorded and gain attention, whereas failures may
never be recorded at all. This makes appraisal of
the method very difficult. One key problem is a
definition of success. Is translocation successful if
the individuals survive the first week or a year, or
do they need to reproduce for one or several
generations? Whatever the answer, it is clear that a
general framework is required to ensure that any
translocation is justified, has a realistic chance of
success, and will be properly monitored and
evaluated for the benefit of future efforts.
An example of apparent translocation success
involves the threatened Seychelles warbler. This
species was once confined to Cousin Island, one of
the Seychelles islands, and reduced to 26
individuals. Careful habitat management increased
this number to over 300 birds, but the single
population remained vulnerable to local
catastrophic events. The decision was taken to
translocate individuals to two nearby islands to
reduce this risk. The translocations took place in
1988 and 1990, and both have resulted in healthy
breeding populations. A successful translocation
exercise also appears to have been achieved with
red howler monkeys in French Guiana. A howler
population was translocated from a site due to be
flooded for hydroelectric power generation. The
release site was an area where local hunting had
reduced the density of the resident howler
population. Released troops of monkeys were kept
under visual observation and followed by radio
tracking of 16 females. Although the troops
appeared to undergo initial problems, causing them
to split up, all the tracked females settled into
normal behavioral patterns.
Unfortunately, the success stories are at least
matched by accounts of failure. Reviewing
translocation of amphibians and reptiles,
researchers C.Kenneth Dodd and Richard A.
Siegel concluded that most projects have not
demonstrated success as conservation techniques
and should not be advocated as though they were
acceptable management and mitigation practices.
121
38 – 2 The Raccoons’ Success
Raccoons have a vast transcontinental distribution,
occurring throughout most of North America and
Central America. They are found from southern
Canada all the way to Panama, as well as on
islands near coastal areas. They occur in each of
the 49 states of the continental United States.
Although raccoons are native only to the Western
Hemisphere, they have been successfully
transplanted to other parts of the globe.
Following a decline to a relatively low population
level in the 1930s, raccoons began to prosper
following their 1943 breeding season. A rapid
population surge continued throughout the 1940s,
and high numbers have been sustained ever since.
By the late 1980s, the number of raccoons in North
America was estimated to be at least 15 to 20
times the number that existed during the 1930s. By
now, their numbers have undoubtedly grown even
more, as they have continued to expand into new
habitats where they were once either rare or
absent, such as sandy prairies, deserts, coastal
marshes, and mountains. Their spread throughout
the Rocky Mountain West is indicative of the fast
pace at which they can exploit new environments.
Despite significant numbers being harvested and
having suffered occasional declines, typically
because of disease, the raccoon has consistently
maintained high population levels.
Several factors explain the raccoon's dramatic
increase in abundance and distribution. First, their
success has been partially attributed to the growth
of cities, as they often thrive in suburban and even
urban settings. Furthermore, they have been
deliberately introduced throughout the continent.
Within the United States, they are commonly taken
from one area to another, both legally and illegally,
to restock hunting areas and, presumably, because
people simply want them to be part of their local
fauna. Their appearance and subsequent
flourishing in Utah's Great Salt Lake valley within
the last 40 years appears to be from such an
introduction. As an example of the ease with which
transplanted individuals can succeed, raccoons
from Indiana (midwestern United States) have
reportedly been able to flourish on islands off the
coast of Alaska.
The raccoon's expansion in various areas may also
be due to the spread of agriculture. Raccoons have
been able to exploit crops, especially corn but also
cereal grains, which have become dependable
food sources for them. The expansion of
agriculture, however, does not necessarily lead to
rapid increases in their abundance. Farming in
Kansas and eastern Colorado (central and western
United States) proceeded rapidly in the 1870s and
1880s, but this was about 50 years before
raccoons started to spread out from their major
habitat, the wooded river bottomlands. They have
also expanded into many areas lacking any
agriculture other than grazing and into places
without forests or permanent streams.
Prior to Europeans settling and farming the Great
Plains Region, raccoons probably were just found
along its rivers and streams and in the wooded
areas of its southeastern section. With the possible
exception of the southern part of the province of
Manitoba, their absence was notable throughout
Canada. They first became more widely distributed
in the southern part of Manitoba, and by the 1940s
were abundant throughout its southeastern portion.
In the 1950s their population swelled in Canada.
The control of coyotes in the prairie region in the
1950s may have been a factor in raccoon
expansion. If their numbers are sufficient coyotes
might be able to suppress raccoon populations
(though little direct evidence supports this notion).
By the 1960s the raccoon had become a major
predator of the canvasback ducks nesting in
southwestern Manitoba.
The extermination of the wolf from most of the
contiguous United States may have been a critical
factor in the raccoon's expansion and numerical
increase. In the eighteenth century, when the wolfs
range included almost all of North America,
raccoons apparently were abundant only in the
deciduous forests of the East, Gulf Coast, and
Great Lakes regions, though they also extended
into the wooded bottomlands of the Midwest's
major rivers. In such areas, their arboreal habits
and the presence of hollow den trees should have
offered some protection from wolves and other
large predators. Even though raccoons may not
have been a significant part of their diet, wolves
surely would have tried to prey on those exposed in
relatively treeless areas.
122
39 – 2 The Extinction of Moa
Between 80 and 85 million years ago,
Gondwanaland, a giant continent made up of what
today is Africa, Antarctica, Australia, and South
America, broke up, thus causing what is now New
Zealand to become separated from the larger
landmass. After the separation, any creature
unable to cross a considerable distance of ocean
could not migrate to New Zealand. Snakes and
most mammals evolved after the separation. Thus,
there are no New Zealand snakes, and bats, which
flew there, and seals, which swam there, were the
only mammals on New Zealand when Polynesian
settlers (the Maori) arrived there about a thousand
years ago.
When the Maori arrived in New Zealand, they
encountered birds that had been evolving for 80
million years without the presence of mammalian
predators. The most striking of these animals must
have been moa. Now extinct, moa were gigantic
wingless birds that stood as much as 10 feet (3
meters) tall and weighed as much as 550 pounds
(250 kilograms). They are known from a diverse
array of remains including eggshells, eggs, a few
mummified carcasses, vast numbers of bones, and
some older fossilized bone. The species of moa
that are currently recognized occupied ecological
niches customarily filled elsewhere by large
mammalian browsing herbivores. They may have
had relatively low reproductive rates; apparently,
they usually laid only one egg at a time.
It seems possible that when Captain James Cook
first visited New Zealand in 1769, moa (or at least
one of the moa species) may have still survived in
the remote areas in the western part of New
Zealand's South Island. If so, these individuals
would have been the last of their kind. Climatic
conditions in New Zealand appear to have been
relatively stable over the period during which moa
became extinct. Different factors could have
worked in concert to account for their abrupt
disappearance.
Vegetation was considerably altered by the Maori
occupation of New Zealand, a change not easily
explained by climate variation or other possible
factors. Forest and shrubland burning appears to
have reduced the prime habitat of many moa
species. However, the main forest burning started
around 700 years ago, after what current
archaeological evidence indicates was the most
intensive stage of moa hunting. While there
appears to have been extensive burning on the
east side of New Zealand's South Island, large
forest tracts remained in the most southern part of
the island. Because major habitat destruction
seems to have occurred after moa populations
already were depleted, and because some habitat
that could have sheltered moa populations
remained, it would seem that other factors were
also at work in the extinction of these birds.
For South Island, human predation appears to
have been a significant factor in the depletion of
the population of moa. At one excavated Maori site,
moa remains filled six railway cars. The density of
Maori settlements and artifacts increased
substantially at the time of the most intensive moa
hunting (900 to 600 years ago). This period was
followed by a time of decline in the Maori
population and a societal transition to smaller, less
numerous settlements. The apparent decline fits
the pattern expected as a consequence of the
Maori's overexploitation of moa.
Finally, the Maori introduced the Polynesian rat and
the dog to New Zealand. The actions of these
potential nest predators could have reduced moa
populations without leaving much direct evidence.
The Maori may have also inadvertently brought
pests and disease organisms in fowls, which could
have crossed over to eradicate moa populations.
The possibility of analyzing ancient DNA to identify
past diseases of extinct animals is being explored.
However, evidence of such diseases is difficult to
determine directly from paleoecological or
archaeological remains. For these reasons, it is
hard to determine the likelihood that introduced
disease organisms were a cause of the decline of
moa, but they are potentially significant.
While the last of these possible causes remains
speculative, define clues exist for the action of the
first two causes. The story of moa species and their
demise raises ecological issues on the vulnerability
of species to human-caused changes—including
altered vegetative cover of the landscape, change
in the physical environment, and modification of the
flora and fauna of a region by eliminating some
species and introducing others.
123
74 – 1 Early Horses
The earliest-known horse fossils come from the
Eocene epoch (from 57 to 34 million years
ago),and they are so different from the modern
version that it was not initially realized that there
was any relation.Dawn horse,or Eohippus,as this
animal has been called,has been found in both
Europe and North America. Eohippus was
tiny,about the size of a small dog,and apparently
lived in wooded areas.These animals had hooves
but,in contrast to modern horses,they had four
hoofed toes on the front feet,three on the rear,and
the hooves were padded. Eohippus was also pugnosed by comparison to modern horses,and its
teeth reveal that it was a browser that fed on a
variety of plants.In fact,although it was completely
herbivorous (plant eating),this little horse had
canine teeth-a reminder that many of its
predecessors were carnivores (meat eaters).
Throughout the Eocene and Oligocene epochs
(from 57 to 23 million years ago),the descendants
of Eohippus evolved in a fairly straightforward way
that is well documented by their fossils.They
became gradually larger;the middle toe, eventually
to become the single hoof of the modern
horses,became stronger and more prominent,and
the grinding surfaces of the teeth became
larger,with complex,resistant ridges.But the
resemblance to Eohippus remained clear.It was
only in the Miocene (from 23 to 5 million years
ago),coincident with the spread of grassy
prairies,that abrupt changes took place,resulting in
several different lineages of horse evolution,only
one of which is still extant:the modern horse.
Several of the physical characteristics of today's
animals are ultimately linked to their diet of
grasses. Foremost among the Miocene
modifications that led toward present-day horses
were changes in the teeth and the shape of the
head. Compared to the succulent leaves of tropical
trees that were the fodder for some of the horse's
ancestors, grasses are abrasive and much more
difficult to chew and grind. The response of the
Miocene horses was to develop teeth with much
more elaborate and resistant grinding surfaces and
with much larger crowns, at least part of which
could grow out of the gums as they were worn
down. These changes meant that the head had to
be much deeper,and the muzzle longer,to make
room for the long rows of grinding teeth along the
horse's cheeks.At about the same time,the legs
and feet of the ancestors of today's horses became
better adapted to rapid running across the
spreading grasslands.This occurred through fusion
of several of the independent bones in the lower
parts of the legs,making them stiffer,and through
further emphasis of the central hoofed toe,which by
now bore the entire weight of the animal.In place of
a foot,the horse has a single toe at the end of its
leg.
By the middle or late Miocene,many of the extant
horses were at least superficially similar to modern
horses.Based on the fossil record,much of their
development seems to have occurred in North
America,but by the Pleistocene epoch (from 1.6
million to 10,000 years ago),the modern horse
genus,Equus,had spread over much of the
world.Then,inexplicably,only 8,000 to 10,000 years
ago, horses disappeared from North America.The
reason for this extinction is unknown. Whatever the
cause,it is a fact that the plains of North America
were without these animals for thousands of
years,until horses brought from Europe by the early
Spanish explorers escaped and began to
repopulate the vast grasslands.
It is clear that many of the familiar features of the
modern horse are directly or indirectly related to its
diet and its preferred environment, grasslands. But
how and why did the grasslands develop when
they did? There are competing theories on this
question, but only a few are consistent with the
evidence. Most of these invoke a change in global
climate as an important factor, perhaps the
overriding factor. In particular, grasslands
expanded rapidly as the climate in continental
interiors became cooler and drier.
124
40 – 3 Amphibian Thermoregulation
In contrast to mammals and birds, amphibians are
unable to produce thermal energy through their
metabolic activity, which would allow them to
regulate their body temperature independent of the
surrounding or ambient temperature. However, the
idea that amphibians have no control whatsoever
over their body temperature has been proven false
because their body temperature does not always
correspond to the surrounding temperature. While
amphibians are poor thermoregulators, they do
exercise control over their body temperature to a
limited degree.
Physiological adaptations can assist amphibians in
colonizing habitats where extreme conditions
prevail. The tolerance range in body temperature
represents the range of temperatures within which
a species can survive. One species of North
American newt is still active when temperatures
drop to -2°C while one South American frog feels
comfortable even when temperatures rise to
41°C—the highest body temperature measured in
a free-ranging amphibian. Recently it has been
shown that some North American frog and toad
species can survive up to five days with a body
temperature of -6°C with approximately one-third of
their body fluids frozen. The other tissues are
protected because they contain the frost-protective
agents glycerin or glucose. Additionally, in many
species the tolerance boundaries are flexible and
can change as a result of acclimatization (long-term
exposure to particular conditions).
Frog species that remain exposed to the sun
despite high diurnal (daytime) temperatures exhibit
some fascinating modifications in the skin structure
that function as morphological adaptations. Most
amphibian skin is fully water permeable and is
therefore not a barrier against evaporation or solar
radiation. The African savanna frog Hyperolius
viridiflavus stores guanine crystals in its skin, which
enable it to better reflect solar radiation, thus
providing protection against overheating. The tree
frog Phyllomedusa sauvager responds to
evaporative losses with gland secretions that
provide a greasy film over its entire body that helps
prevent desiccation (dehydration).
However, behavior is by far the most important
factor in thermoregulation. The principal elements
in behavioral thermoregulation are basking
(heliothermy), heat exchange with substrates such
as rock or earth (thigmothermy), and diurnal and
annual avoidance behaviors, which include moving
to shelter during the day for cooling and hibernating
or estivating (reducing activity during cold or hot
weather, respectively) . Hellothermyis especially
common among frogs and toads: it allows them to
increase their body temperature by more than
10°C. The Andean toad Bufo spinulosus exposes
itself immediately after sunrise on moist ground and
attains its preferred body temperature by this
means, long before either ground or air is
correspondingly warmed. A positive side effect of
this approach is that it accelerates the digestion of
the prey consumed overnight, thus also
accelerating growth. Thigmothermy is a behavior
present in most amphibians, although pressing
against the ground serves a dual purpose: heat
absorption by conductivity and water absorption
through the skin. The effect of thigmothermy is
especially evident in the Andean toad during
rainfall: its body temperature corresponds to the
temperature of the warm earth and not to the much
cooler air temperature.
Avoidance behavior occurs whenever physiological
and morphological adaptations are insufficient to
maintain body temperature within the vital range.
Nocturnal activity in amphibians with low tolerance
for high ambient temperatures is a typical
thermoregulatory behavior of avoidance. Seasonal
avoidance behavior is extremely important in many
amphibians. Species whose habitat lies in the
temperate latitudes are confronted by lethal low
temperatures in winter, while species dwelling in
semi- and regions are exposed to long dry, hot
periods in summer.
In amphibians hibernation occurs in mud or deep
holes away from frost. North of the Pyrenees
Mountains, the natterjack toad offers a good
example of hibernation, passing the winter dug
deep into sandy ground. Conversely, natterjacks in
southern Spain remain active during the mild
winters common to the region and are instead
forced into inactivity during the dry, hot summer
season. Summer estivation also occurs by
burrowing into the ground or hiding in cool, deep
rock crevasses to avoid desiccation and lethal
ambient temperature. Amphibians are therefore
hardly at mercy of ambient temperature, since by
means of the mechanisms described above they
are more than exercising some control over their
body temperature.
125
42 – 1 Geographic Isolation of Species
Biologist Ernst Mayr defined a species as “an
actually or potentially interbreeding population that
does not interbreed with other such populations
when there is opportunity to do so.”A key event in
the origin of many species is the separation of a
population with its gene pool (all of the genes in a
population at any one time) from other populations
of the same species, thereby preventing population
interbreeding. With its gene pool isolated, a
separate population can follow its own evolutionary
course. In the formation of many species, the initial
isolation of a population seems to have been a
geographic barrier This mode of evolving new
species is called allopatric speciation.
Many factors can isolate a population
geographically. A mountain range may emerge and
gradually split a population of organisms that can
inhabit only lowland lakes, certain fish populations
might become isolated in this way. Similarity, a
creeping glacier may gradually divide a population,
or a land bridge such as the Isthmus of Panama
may form and separate the marine life in the ocean
waters on either side.
How formidable must a geographic barrier be to
keep populations apart? It depends on the ability of
the organisms to move across barriers. Birds and
coyotes can easily cross mountains and rivers. The
passage of wind-blown tree pollen is also not
hindered by such barriers, and the seeds of many
plants may be earned back and forth on animals. In
contrast, small rodents may find a deep canyon or
a wide river an effective barrier. For example, the
Grand Canyon, in the southwestern United Slates,
separate the range of the while-tailed antelope
squirrel from that of the closely related Harris’
antelope squirrel. Smaller, with a shorter tail that is
white underneath, the white-tailed antelope squirrel
inhabits deserts north of the canyon and west of
the Colorado River in southern California Hams'
antelope squirrel has a more limited range in
deserts south of the Grand Canyon.
Geographic isolation creates opportunities for new
species to develop, but it does not necessarily lead
to new species because speciation occurs only
when the gene pool undergoes enough changes to
establish reproductive barriers between the
isolated population and its parent population. The
likelihood of allopatric speciation increases when a
population is small as well as isolated, making it
more likely than a large population to have its gene
pool changed substantially. For example, in less
than two million years, small populations of stray
animals and plants from the South American
mainland that managed to colonize the Galapagos
Islands gave rise to all the species that now inhabit
the islands.
When oceanic islands are far enough apart to
permit populations to evolve in isolation, but close
enough to allow occasional dispersions to occur,
they are effectively outdoor laboratories of
evolution. The Galapagos island chain is one of the
world's greatest showcases of evolution. Each
island was born from underwater volcanoes and
was gradually covered by organisms derived from
strays that rode the ocean currents and winds from
other islands and continents. Organisms can also
be carried to islands by other organisms, such as
sea birds that travel long distances with seeds
clinging to their feathers.
The species on the Galapagos Islands today, most
of which occur nowhere else, descended from
organisms that floated, flew, or were blown over the
sea from the South American mainland. For
instance, the Galapagos island chain has a total of
thirteen species of closely related birds called
Galapagos finches. These birds have many
similarities but differ in their feeding habits and their
beak type, which is correlated with what they eat.
Accumulated evidence indicates that all thirteen
finch species evolved from a single small
population of ancestral birds that colonized one of
the islands. Completely isolated on the island after
migrating from the mainland, the founder
population may have undergone significant
changes in its gene pool and become a new
species. Later, a few individuals of this new species
may have been blown by storms to a neighboring
island. Isolated on this second island, the second
founder population could have evolved into a
second new species, which could later recolonize
the island from which its founding population
emigrated. Today each Galapagos island has
multiple species of finches, with as many as ten on
some islands.

42 – 2 Explaining Dinosaur Extinction
Dinosaurs rapidly became extinct about 65 million
years ago as part of a mass extinction known as
the K-T event, because it is associated with a
geological signature known as the K-T boundary,
usually a thin band of sedimentation found in
various parts of the world (K is the traditional
abbreviation for the Cretaceous, derived from the
German name Kreidezeit). Many explanations have
been proposed for why dinosaurs became extinct.
For example, some have blamed dinosaur
extinction on the development of flowering plants,
which were supposedly more difficult to digest and
could have caused constipation or indigestion—
except that flowering plants first evolved in the
Early Cretaceous, about 60 million years before the
dinosaurs died out. In fact, several scientists have
suggested that the duckbill dinosaurs and homed
dinosaurs, with their complex battery of grinding
teeth, evolved to exploit this new resource of
rapidly growing flowering plants. Others have
blamed extinction on competition from the
mammals, which allegedly ate all the dinosaur
eggs—except that mammals and dinosaurs
appeared at the same time in the Late Triassic,
about 190 million years ago, and there is no reason
to believe that mammals suddenly acquired a taste
for dinosaur eggs after 120 million years of
coexistence Some explanations (such as the one
stating that dinosaurs all died of diseases) fail
because there is no way to scientifically test them,
and they cannot move beyond the realm of
speculation and guesswork.
This focus on explaining dinosaur extinction misses
an important point the extinction at the end of the
Cretaceous was a global event that killed off
organisms up and down the food chain. It wiped
out many kinds of plankton in the ocean and many
marine organisms that lived on the plankton at the
base of the food chain. These included a variety of
clams and snails, and especially the ammonites, a
group of shelled squidlike creatures that dominated
the Mesozoic seas and had survived many
previous mass extinctions. The K-T event marked
the end of the marine reptiles, such as the
mosasaurs and the plesiosaurs, which were the
largest creatures that had ever lived in the seas
and which ruled the seas long before whales
evolved. On land, there was also a crisis among
the land plants, in addition to the disappearance of
dinosaurs. So any event that can explain the
destruction of the base of the food chain (plankton
in the ocean, plants on land) can better explain
what happened to organisms at the top of the food
chain, such as the dinosaurs. By contrast, any
explanation that focuses strictly on the dinosaurs
completely misses the point. The Cretaceous
extinctions were a global phenomenon, and
dinosaurs were just a part of a bigger picture.
According to one theory, the Age of Dinosaurs
ended suddenly 65 million years ago when a giant
rock from space plummeted to Earth. Estimated to
be ten to fifteen kilometers in diameter, this bolide
(either a comet or an asteroid) was traveling at
cosmic speeds of 20-70 kilometers per second, or
45,000-156,000 miles per hour. Such a huge mass
traveling at such tremendous speeds carries an
enormous amount of energy. When the bolide
struck this energy was released and generated a
huge shock wave that leveled everything for
thousands of kilometers around the impact and
caused most of the landscape to burst into flames.
The bolide struck an area of the Yucatan Peninsula
of Mexico known as Chicxulub, excavating a crater
15-20 kilometers deep and at least 170 kilometers
in diameter. The impact displaced huge volumes of
seawater, causing much flood damage in the
Caribbean. Meanwhile, the bolide itself excavated
100 cubic kilometers of rock and debris from the
site, which rose to an altitude of 100 kilometers.
Most of it fell back immediately, but some of it
remained as dust in the atmosphere for months.
This material, along with the smoke from the fires,
shrouded Earth, creating a form of nuclear winter.
According to computerized climate models, global
temperatures fell to near the freezing point,
photosynthesis halted, and most plants on land and
in the sea died. With the bottom of the food chain
destroyed, dinosaurs could not survive.
127
45 – 3 Feeding Strategies in the Ocean
In the open sea, animals can often find food
reliably available in particular regions or seasons (e
g., in coastal areas in springtime). In these
circumstances, animals are neither constrained to
get the last calorie out of their diet nor is energy
conservation a high priority. In contrast, the food
levels in the deeper layers of the ocean are greatly
reduced, and the energy constraints on the animals
are much more severe. To survive at those levels,
animals must maximize their energy input, finding
and eating whatever potential food source may be
present.
In the near-surface layers, there are many large,
fast carnivores as well as an immense variety of
planktonic animals, which feed on plankton (small,
free-floating plants or animals) by filtering them
from currents of water that pass through a
specialized anatomical structure. These filterfeeders thrive in the well-illuminated surface waters
because oceans have so many very small
organisms, from bacteria to large algae to larval
crustaceans. Even fishes can become successful
filter-feeders in some circumstances. Although the
vast majority of marine fishes are carnivores, in
near-surface regions of high productivity the
concentrations of larger phytoplankton (the plant
component of plankton) are sufficient to support
huge populations of filter-feeding sardines and
anchovies. These small fishes use their gill
filaments to strain out the algae that dominate such
areas. Sardines and anchovies provide the basis
for huge commercial fisheries as well as a food
resource for large numbers of local carnivores,
particularly seabirds. At a much larger scale,
baleen whales and whale sharks are also efficient
filter-feeders in productive coastal or polar waters,
although their filtered particles comprise small
animals such as copepods and krill rather than
phytoplankton.
Filtering seawater for its particulate nutritional
content can be an energetically demanding method
of feeding, particularly when the current of water to
be filtered has to be generated by the organism
itself, as is the case for all planktonic animals.
Particulate organic matter of at least 2.5
micrograms per cubic liter is required to provide a
filter-feeding planktonic organism with a net energy
gain This value is easily exceeded in most coastal
waters, but in the deep sea, the levels of organic
matter range from next to nothing to around 7
micrograms per cubic liter. Even though mean
levels may mask much higher local concentrations,
it is still the case that many deep-sea animals are
exposed to conditions in which a normal filterfeeder would starve.
There are, therefore, fewer successful filter-feeders
in deep water, and some of those that are there
have larger filtering systems to cope with the
scarcity of particles. Another solution for such
animals is to forage in particular layers of water
where the particles may be more concentrated.
Many of the groups of animals that typify the filterfeeding lifestyle in shallow water have deep-sea
representatives that have become predatory. Their
filtering systems, which reach such a high degree
of development in shallow- water species, are
greatly reduced. Alternative methods of active or
passive prey capture have been evolved, including
trapping and seizing prey, entangling prey, and
sticky tentacles.
In the deeper waters of the oceans, there is a much
greater tendency for animals to await the arrival of
food particles or prey rather than to search them
out actively (thus minimizing energy expenditure).
This has resulted in a more stealthy style of
feeding, with the consequent emphasis on lures
and/or the evolution of elongated appendages that
increase the active volume of water controlled or
monitored by the animal. Another consequence of
the limited availability of prey is that many animals
have developed ways of coping with much larger
food particles, relative to their own body size, than
the equivalent shallower species can process.
Among the fishes there is a tendency for the teeth
and jaws to become appreciably enlarged. In such
creatures, not only are the teeth hugely enlarged
and/or the jaws elongated but the size of the mouth
opening may be greatly increased by making the
jaw articulations so flexible that they can be
effectively dislocated. Very large or long teeth
provide almost no room for cutting the prey into a
convenient size for swallowing, the fish must gulp
the prey down whole.
128
44 – 1 From Fish to Terrestrial Vertebrates
One of the most significant evolutionary events that
occurred on Earth was the transition of waterdwelling fish to terrestrial tetrapods (four-limbed
organisms with backbones). Fish probably
originated in the oceans, and our first records of
them are in marine rocks. However, by the
Devonian Period (408 million to 362 million years
ago), they had radiated into almost all available
aquatic habitats, including freshwater settings. One
of the groups whose fossils are especially common
in rocks deposited in fresh water is the lobe-finned
fish.
The freshwater Devonian lobe-finned fish
rhipidistian crossopterygian is of particular interest
to biologists studying tetrapod evolution. These fish
lived in river channels and lakes on large deltas.
The delta rocks in which these fossils are found are
commonly red due to oxidized iron minerals,
indicating that the deltas formed in a climate that
had alternate wet and dry periods. If there were
periods of drought, any adaptations allowing the
fish to survive the dry conditions would have been
advantageous. In these rhipidistians, several such
adaptations existed. It is known that they had lungs
as well as gills for breathing. Cross sections cut
through some of the fossils reveal that the mud
filing the interior of the carcass differed in
consistency and texture depending on its location
inside the fish. These differences suggest a saclike
cavity below the front end of the gut that can only
be interpreted as a lung. Gills were undoubtedly
the main source of oxygen for these fish, but the
lungs served as an auxiliary breathing device for
gulping air when the water became oxygen
depleted, such as during extended periods of
drought. So, these fish had already evolved one of
the prime requisites for living on land, the ability to
use air as a source of oxygen.
A second adaptation of these fish was in the
structure of the lobe fins. The fins were thick,
fleshy, and quite sturdy, with a median axis of bone
down the center. They could have been used as
feeble locomotor devices on land, perhaps good
enough to allow a fish to flop its way from one pool
of water that was almost dry to an adjacent pond
that had enough water and oxygen for survival.
These fins eventually changed into short, stubby
legs. The bones of the fins of a Devonian
rhipidistian exactly match in number and position
the limb bones of the earliest known tetrapods, the
amphibians. It should be emphasized that the
evolution of lungs and limbs was in no sense an
anticipation of future life on land. These
adaptations developed because they helped fish to
survive in their existing aquatic environment.
What ecological pressures might have caused
fishes to gradually abandon their watery habitat
and become increasingly land-dwelling creatures?
Changes in climate during the Devonian may have
had something to do with this if freshwater areas
became progressively more restricted. Another
impetus may have been new sources of food. The
edges of ponds and streams surely had scattered
dead fish and other water-dwelling creatures. In
addition, plants had emerged into terrestrial
habitats in areas near streams and ponds, and
crabs and other arthropods were also members of
this earliest terrestrial community. Thus, by the
Devonian the land habitat marginal to freshwater
was probably a rich source of protein that could be
exploited by an animal that could easily climb out of
water. Evidence from teeth suggests that these
earliest tetrapods did not utilize land plants as food;
they were presumably carnivorous and had not
developed the ability to feed on plants.
How did the first tetrapods make the transition to a
terrestrial habitat? Like early land plants such as
rhyniophytes, they made only a partial transition,
they were still quite tied to water. However, many
problems that faced early land plants were not
applicable to the first tetrapods. The ancestors of
these animals already had a circulation system,
and they were mobile, so that they could move to
water to drink. Furthermore, they already had
lungs, which rhipidistians presumably used for
auxiliary breathing. The principal changes for the
earliest tetrapods were in the skeletal systemchanges in the bones of the fins, the vertebral
column, pelvic girdle, and pectoral girdle.
129
46 – 4 Crown of Thorns Starfish and Coral
Reefs
The crown of thorns starfish, Acanthaster Tlanci, is
large, twenty-five to thirty-five centimeters in
diameter, and has seven to twenty-one arms that
are covered in spines. It feeds primarily on coral
and is found from the Indian Ocean to the west
coast of Central America, usually at quite low
population densities. Since the mid-1950s,
population outbreaks at densities four to six times
greater than normal have occurred at the same
time in places such as Hawaii, Tahiti, Panama, and
the Great Barrier Reef. The result has often been
the loss of a fifty percent to nearly one hundred
percent of the coral cover over large areas.
A single Acanthaster can consume five to six
square meters of coral polyps per year, and dense
populations can destroy up to six square kilometers
per year and move on rapidly. Acanthasters show a
preference for branching corals, especially
Acroporids. After an outbreak in a particular area, it
is common to find that Acroporids have been
selectively removed, leaving a mosaic of living and
dead corals. In places where Acroporids previously
dominated the community devastation can be
almost complete, and local areas of reefs have
collapsed.
Areas of dead coral are usually colonized rapidly
by algae and often are later colonized by sponges
and soft corals. Increases in abundance of planteating fish and decreases in abundance of coralfeeding fish accompany these changes. Coral
larvae settle among the algae and eventually
establish flourishing coral colonies. In ten to fifteen
years the reefs often return to about the same
percentage of coral cover as before. Development
of a four-species diversity takes about twenty
years.
Two schools of thought exist concerning the cause
of these outbreaks. One group holds that they are
natural phenomena that have occurred many times
in the past, citing old men's recollections of earlier
outbreaks and evidence from traditional cultures.
The other group maintains that recent human
activities ranging from physical coral destruction
through pollution to predator removal have
triggered these events.
One theory, the adult aggregation hypothesis,
maintains that most species is more abundant than
we realize when a storm destroys coral and causes
a food shortage. The adult Acanthasters converge
on remaining portions of healthy coral and feed
hungrily. Certainly there have been outbreaks of
Acanthaster following large storms, but there is little
evidence that the storms have caused the enough
reef damage to create a food shortage for these
starfish.
Two other hypotheses attempt to explain the
increased abundance of Acanthaster after
episodes of high terrestrial runoff following storms.
The first hypothesis is that low salinity and high
temperatures favor the survival of the starfish
larvae. The second hypothesis emphasizes the
food web aspect, suggesting that strong fresh
water runoff brings additional nutrients to the
coastal waters, stimulating phytoplankton
production and promoting more rapid development
and better survival of the starfish larvae.
Those favoring anthropogenic (human influenced)
causes have pointed to the large proportion of
outbreaks that have been near centers of human
populations. It has been suggested that coral
polyps are the main predators of the starfish larvae.
Destruction of coral by blasting and other bad land
use practices would reduce predation on the
starfish larvae and cause a feedback in which
increases in Acanthaster populations cause still
further coral destruction. Unfortunately, there are
too few documented instances of physical
destruction of coral being followed by outbreaks of
Acanthaster for these hypotheses to be fully
supported.
Another group of hypothesis focuses on removal of
Acanthaster's predators. Some have suggested
that the predators might have been killed off by
pollution whereas others have suggested that the
harvesting of vertebrate and invertebrate predators
of Acanthaster could have reduced mortality and
caused increased abundance of adults. The
problem with this group of hypothesis is that it is
difficult to understand how reduced predation
would lead to sudden increases in Acanthaster
numbers in several places at the same time in
specific years. It seems probable that there is no
single explanation but that there are elements of
the truth in several of the hypotheses. That is there
are natural processes that have led to outbreaks in
the past, but human impact has increased the
frequency and severity of the outbreaks.

45 – 1 Microscopes The Beringia Landscape
During the peak of the last ice age, northeast Asia
(Siberia) and Alaska were connected by a broad
land mass called the Bering Land Bridge. This land
bridge existed because so much of Earth’s water
was frozen in the great ice sheets that sea levels
were over 100 meters lower than they are today.
Between 25,000 and 10,000 years ago, Siberia, the
Bering Land Bndge, and Alaska shared many
environmental characteristics. These included a
common mammalian fauna of large mammals, a
common flora composed of broad grasslands as
well as wind-swept dunes and tundra, and a
common climate with cold, dry winters and
somewhat wanner summers. The recognition that
many aspects of the modem flora and fauna were
present on both sides of the Bering Sea as
remnants of the ice-age landscape led to this
region being named Beringia.
It is through Beringia that small groups of large
mammal hunters, slowly expanding their hunting
territories, eventually colonized North and South
America. On this archaeologists generally agree,
but that is where the agreement stops. One broad
area of disagreement in explaining the peopling of
the Americas is the domain of paleoecologists, but
it is critical to understanding human history: what
was Beringia like?
The Beringian landscape was very different from
what it is today. Broad, windswept valleys;
glaciated mountains; sparse vegetation; and less
moisture created a rather forbidding land mass.
This land mass supported herds of now-extinct
species of mammoth, bison, and horse and
somewhat modern versions of caribou, musk ox,
elk, and saiga antelope. These grazers supported
in turn a number of impressive carnivores, including
the giant short-faced bear, the saber-tooth cat, and
a large species of lion.
The presence of mammal species that require
grassland vegetation has led Arctic biologist Dale
Guthrie to argue that while cold and dry, there must
have been broad areas of dense vegetation to
support herds of mammoth, horse, and bison.
Further, nearly all of the ice-age fauna had teeth
that indicate an adaptation to grasses and sedges;
they could not have been supported by a modern
flora of mosses and lichens. Guthrie has also
demonstrated that the landscape must have been
subject to intense and continuous winds, especially
in winter. He makes this argument based on the
anatomy of horse and bison, which do not have the
ability to search for food through deep snow cover.
They need landscapes with strong winds that
remove the winter snows, exposing the dry grasses
beneath. Guthrie applied the term “ mammoth
steppe" to characterize this landscape.
In contrast, Paul Colinvaux has offered a
counterargument based on the analysis of pollen in
lake sediments dating to the last ice age. He found
that the amount of pollen recovered in these
sediments is so low that the Beringian landscape
during the peak of the last glaciation was more
likely to have been what he termed a "polar desert,"
with little or only sparse vegetation, in no way was
it possible that this region could have supported
large herds of mammals and thus, human hunters.
Guthrie has argued against this view by pointing
out that radiocarbon analysis of mammoth, horse,
and bison bones from Beringian deposits revealed
that the bones date to the period of most intense
glaciation.
The argument seemed to be at a standstill until a
number of recent studies resulted in a spectacular
suite of new finds. The first was the discovery of a
1,000-square-kilometer preserved patch of
Beringian vegetation dating to just over 17,000
years ago—the peak of the last ice age. The plants
were preserved under a thick ash fall from a
volcanic eruption. Investigations of the plants found
grasses, sedges, mosses, and many other varieties
in a nearly continuous cover, as was predicted by
Guthrie. But this vegetation had a thin root mat with
no soil formation, demonstrating that there was little
long-term stability in plant cover, a finding
supporting some of the arguments of Colinvaux. A
mixture of continuous but thin vegetation
supporting herds of large mammals is one that
seems plausible and realistic with the available
data.
131
47 – 2 Termite Ingenuity
Termites, social insects which live in colonies that,
in some species, contain 2 million individuals or
more, are often incorrectly referred to as white
ants. But they are certainly not ants. Termites,
unlike ants, have gradual metamorphosis with only
three life stage: egg, nymph, and adult. Ants and
the other social members of their order, certain
bees and wasps, have complete metamorphosis in
four life stages; egg, larva, pupa, and adult. The
worker and soldier castes of social ants, bees, and
wasps consist of only females, all daughters of a
single queen that mated soon after she matured
and thereafter never mated again. The worker and
soldier castes of termites consist of both males and
females, and the queen lives permanently with a
male consort.
Since termites are small and soft-bodied, they
easily become desiccated and must live in moist
places with a high relative humidity. They do best
when the relative humidity in their nest is above 96
percent and the temperature is fairly high, an
optimum of about 79°F for temperate zone species
and about 86°F for tropical species. Subterranean
termites, the destructive species that occurs
commonly throughout the eastern United States,
attain these conditions by nesting in moist soil that
is in contact with wood, their only food. The
surrounding soil keeps the nest moist and tends to
keep the temperature at a more or less favorable
level. When it is cold in winter, subterranean
termites move to burrows below the frost line.
Some tropical termites are more ingenious
engineers, constructing huge above-ground nests
with built-in “air conditioning” that keeps the nest
moist, at a constant temperature, and well supplied
with oxygen. Among the most architecturally
advanced of these termites is an African species,
Macroternes natalensis. Renowned Swiss
entomologist Martin Luscher described the mounds
of this fungus-growing species as being as much
as 16 feet tall, 16 feet in diameter at their base, and
with a cement-like wall of soil mixed with termite
saliva that is from 16 to 23 inches thick. The thick
and dense wall of the mound insulates the interior
microclimate from the variations in humidity and
temperature of the outside atmosphere. Several
narrow and relatively thin-walled ridges on the
outside of the mound extend from near its base
almost to its top.
According to Luscher, a medium-sized nest of
Macrotermes has a population of about 2 million
individuals. The metabolism of so many termites
and of the fungus that they grow in their gardens as
food helps keep the interior of the nest warm and
supplies some moisture to the air in the nest. The
termites saturate the atmosphere of the nest,
bringing it to about 100 percent relative humidity,
by carrying water up from the soil.
But how is this well-insulated nest ventilated? Its
many occupants require over 250 quarts of oxygen
(more than 1,200 quarts of air ) per day. How can
so much oxygen diffuse through the thick walls of
the mound? Even the pores in the wall are filled
with water, which almost stops the diffusion of
gases. The answer lies in the construction of the
nest. The interior consists of a large central core in
which the fungus is grown, below it is “cellar” of
empty space, above it is an “attic” of empty space,
and within the ridges on the outer wall of the nest,
there are many small tunnels that connect the
cellar and the attic. The warm air in the fungus
gardens rises through the nest up to the attic. From
the attic, the air passes into the tunnels in the
ridges and flows back down to the cellar. Gases,
mainly oxygen coming in and carbon dioxide going
out, easily diffuse into or out of the ridges, since
their walls are thin and their surface area is large
because they protrude far our from the wall of the
mound. Thus air that flows down into the cellar
through the ridges is relatively rich in oxygen, and
has lost much of its carbon dioxide. It supplies the
nest’s inhabitants with fresh oxygen as it rises
through the fungus-growing area back up to the
attic.
132
48 – 2 Determining Dinosaur Diet
Determining what extinct dinosaurs ate is difficult,
but we can infer some aspects of their dietary
preferences. Traditionally, this information has
been derived from direct evidence, such as
stomach contents, and indirect evidence, such as
establishing a correlation between particular body
characteristics and diets of living animals and then
inferring habits for dinosaurs.
Animals such as house cats and dogs have large,
stabbing canine teeth at the front of the mouth and
smaller, equally sharp teeth farther back in their
jaws. Many of these animals are also armed with
sharp claws. The advantage of teeth and claws as
predatory tools is obvious. Now consider animals
like cows, horses, rabbits, and mice. These animals
have flat teeth at the back of the jaw that are
analogous to and have the same function as
grindstones. Unlike the meat-slicing and stabbing
teeth of carnivores, the teeth of these animals grind
and shred plant material before digestion.
More clues exist in other parts of the skull. The jaw
joint of carnivores such as dogs and cats has the
mechanical advantage of being at the same level
as the tooth row, allowing the jaws to close with
tremendous speed and forcing the upper teeth to
occlude against the lower teeth with great
precision. In herbivorous animals, rapid jaw closure
is less important. Because the flat teeth of
herbivores work like grindstones, however, the jaws
mush move both side to side and front to back. The
jaw joints of many advanced herbivores, such as
cows, lie at a different level than the tooth row,
allowing transverse tearing, shredding, and
compression of plant material. If we extend such
observations to extinct dinosaurs, we can infer
dietary preferences (such as carnivory and
herbivory), even though we cannot determine the
exact diet. The duck-billed dinosaurs known as
hadrosaurs are a good example of a group whose
jaw joint is below the level of the tooth row, which
probably helped them grind up tough, fibrous
vegetation.
Paleontologists would like to be much more specific
about a dinosaur’s diet than simply differentiating
carnivore from herbivore. This finer level of
resolution requires direct fossil evidence of
dinosaur meals. Stomach contents are only rarely
preserved, but when present, allow us to determine
exactly what these animals were eating.
In the stomach contents of specimens of
Coelophysis (a small, long-necked dinosaur) are
bones from juvenile animals of the same species.
At one time, these were thought to represent
embryonic animals, suggesting that this small
dinosaur gave birth to live young rather than laying
eggs. Further research indicated that the small
dinosaurs were too large and too well developed to
be prehatchling young. In addition, the juveniles
inside the body cavity were of different sizes. All
the evidence points to the conclusion that these are
the remains of prey items and that, as an adult,
Coelophysis was at least in part a cannibal.
Fossilized stomach contents are not restricted to
carnivorous dinosaurs. In a few rare cases, most of
them “mummies” (unusually well preserved
specimens), fossilized plant remains have been
found inside the body cavity of hadrosaurs. Some
paleontologists have argued that these represent
stream accumulations rather than final meals. The
best known of these cases is the second
Edmontosaurus mummy collected by the
Sternbergs. In the chest cavity of this specimen,
which is housed in the Senckenberg Museum in
Germany, are the fossil remains of conifer needles,
twigs, seeds, and fruits. Similar finds in
Corythosaurus specimens from Alberta, Canada,
have also been reported, indicating that at least
two kinds of Late Cretaceous hadrosaurs fed on
the sorts of tress that are common in today’s boreal
woodlands.
A second form of direct evidence comes from
coprolites (fossilized bodily waste). Several
dinosaur fossil localities preserve coprolites.
Coprolites yield unequivocal evidence about the
dietary habits of dinosaurs. Many parts of plants
and animals are extremely resistant to the digestive
systems of animals and pass completely through
the body with little or no alteration. Study of
coprolites has indicated that the diets of some
herbivorous dinosaurs were relatively diverse, while
other dinosaurs appear to have been specialists,
feeding on particular types of plants. The problem
with inferring diets from coprolites is the difficulty in
accurately associating a particular coprolite with a
specific dinosaur.
133
54 – 2 Overkill of the North American
Megafauna
Thousands of years ago, in North America's past,
all of its megafauna—large mammals such as
mammoths and giant bears—disappeared. One
proposed explanation for this event is that when
the first Americans migrated over from Asia, they
hunted the megafauna to extinction. These people,
known as the Clovis society after a site where their
distinctive spear points were first found, would have
been able to use this food source to expand their
population and fill the continent rapidly. Yet many
scientists argue against this "Pleistocene overkill"
hypothesis. Modern humans have certainly been
capable of such drastic effects on animals, but
could ancient people with little more than stone
spears similarly have caused the extinction of
numerous species of animals? Thirty-five genera or
groups of species (and many individual species)
suffered extinction in North America around 11,000
B.C., soon after the appearance and expansion of
Paleo-lndians throughout the Americas (27 genera
disappeared completely, and another 8 became
locally extinct, surviving only outside North
America).
Although the climate changed at the end of the
Pleistocene, warming trends had happened before.
A period of massive extinction of large mammals
like that seen about 11,000 years ago had not
occurred during the previous 400,000 years,
despite these changes. The only apparently
significant difference in the Americas 11,000 years
ago was the presence of human hunters of these
large mammals. Was this coincidence or causeand-effect?
We do not know. Ecologist Paul S. Martin has
championed the model that associates the
extinction of large mammals at the end of the
Pleistocene with human predation. With researcher
J. E. Mosimann, he has co-authored a work in
which a computer model showed that in around
300 years, given the right conditions, a small influx
of hunters into eastern Beringia 12,000 years ago
could have spread across North America in a wave
and wiped out game animals to feed their
burgeoning population.
The researchers ran the model several ways,
always beginning with a population of 100 humans
in Edmonton, in Alberta, Canada, at 11,500 years
ago. Assuming different initial North American biggame-animal populations (75-150 million animals)
and different population growth rates for the human
settlers (0.65%-3.5%), and varying kill rates,
Mosimann and Martin derived figures of between
279 and 1,157 years from initial contact to biggame extinction.
Many scholars continue to support this scenario.
For example, geologist Larry Agenbroad has
mapped the locations of dated Clovis sites
alongside the distribution of dated sites where the
remains of wooly mammoths have been found in
both archaeological and purely paleontological
contexts. These distributions show remarkable
synchronicity (occurrence at the same time).
There are, however, many problems with this
model. Significantly, though a few sites are quite
impressive, there really is very little archaeological
evidence to support it. Writing in 1982, Martin
himself admitted the paucity of evidence; for
example, at that point, the remains of only 38
individual mammoths had been found at Clovis
sites. In the years since, few additional mammoths
have been added to the list; there are still fewer
than 20 Clovis sites where the remains of one or
more mammoths have been recovered, a
minuscule proportion of the millions that
necessarily would have had to have been
slaughtered within the overkill scenario.
Though Martin claims the lack of evidence actually
supports his model—the evidence is sparse
because the spread of humans and the extinction
of animals occurred so quickly—this argument
seems weak. And how could we ever disprove it?
As archaeologist Donald Grayson points out, in
other cases where extinction resulted from the
quick spread of human hunters—for example, the
extinction of the moa, the large flightless bird of
New Zealand—archaeological evidence in the form
of remains is abundant. Grayson has also shown
that the evidence is not so clear that all or even
most of the large herbivores in late Pleistocene
America became extinct after the appearance of
Clovis. Of the 35 extinct genera, only 8 can be
confidently assigned an extinction date of between
12,000 and 10,000 years ago. Many of the older
genera, Grayson argues, may have succumbed
before 12,000 B.C., at least half a century before
the Clovis showed up in the American West.

55 – 3 How Herding Can Provide Safety
In open grasslands, there is no place for a large
animal to hide. Thus a watchful grazing animal will
see the slight movement that betrays the presence
of a predator long before it is close enough to
launch an attack. It sounds as though the hunters
(predators) stand no chance at all. Unfortunately
for the grazers, life is not so simple, however. A
grazing animal must lower its head and look at the
ground to feed. Its attention may be occupied for
only a few seconds before it raises its head and
resumes its watch while chewing the food it took:
but hunters are patient and skillful and are
concentrating intensely. Those few seconds
provide time enough to advance a few steps and
then freeze, body flattened against the ground. It
may take hours: but eventually, these repeated
small advances will put the hunter within range—
close enough to outrun its prey—and the long time
the hunt has taken will have been worthwhile
because the resulting feast will be highly nutritious.
Clearly, the grazers are at a disadvantage because
while they eat they are vulnerable to attack. The
hunters also have a weakness, however: and it is
one that allows the grazers to survive. Hunters can
attack only one prey animal at a time. This applies
even to the predators that hunt as a team, such as
lionesses, wolves, and hunting dogs. Their hunt
involves running down or ambushing an individual.
Teamwork allows them to hunt animals much
bigger and stronger than themselves and to hunt
more successfully, but it does not allow them to
attack more than one individual at a time.
The grazers exploit this weakness by making it as
difficult as they can for the predators to choose an
individual as a target. They do not graze alone:
scattered widely across the landscape, but together
as a herd. The approaching hunter sees not a
solitary animal, but a crowd of animals, all of them
moving, so they are constantly crossing and
recrossing each other’s paths. No sooner does the
hunter choose an individual than another animal
has crossed in front of it and the target has
disappeared into the herd. From the hunter's point
of view this is highly confusing behavior—as,
indeed, it is meant to be.
There is another advantage to the grazers: A herd
is much more alert than a solitary animal. An
animal has to relax its guard while it is taking food;
but in a herd there are at any time some animals
with their heads down, biting, and others, with their
heads up, watching. What is more, those with their
heads up are looking in different directions so that
together they are alert to any movement anywhere
on the landscape around them. There is no way for
a hunter to approach a herd unobserved. When a
member of the herd spots trouble, it starts to move
away. Other members of the herd move with it and
the entire herd starts to move. If the trouble is
serious and close, the herd will run. The individual
raising the alarm is simply protecting itself but in
doing so it is warning all of the others.
Herding is highly successful, provided members of
the herd stay together in a tight bunch. The hunter
moves with the herd: watching for an individual to
wander away from the others. When that happens,
it tries to move between that individual and the rest
of the herd, preventing it from rejoining. Once it has
done that the hunter has a good chance of making
a kill. If the herd starts to run, a solitary hunter may
abandon the chase: but a pack of wolves or
hunting dogs will regard the running herd of
animals as an opportunity and set off in pursuit. As
the herd runs, one or two old or sick animals, or
young animals that become separated from their
mothers, may fall behind.
As soon as the hunter or hunters seize their prey,
they lose interest in all other grazers since then
they, too, must concentrate on eating, at which
point the herd stops running, those who were left
behind rejoin the group: and they all resume
grazing.

56 – 4 Habitats and Chipmunk Species
There are eight chipmunk species in the Sierra
Nevada mountain range, and most of them look
pretty much alike. But eight different species of
chipmunks'scurrying around a picnic area will not
be found. Nowhere in the Sierra do all eight
species occur together. Each species tends
strongly to occupy a specific habitat type, within an
elevational range, and the overlap among them is
minimal.
The eight chipmunk species of the Sierra Nevada
represent but a few of the 15 species found in
western North America, yet the whole of eastern
North America makes do with but one species: the
Eastern chipmunk. Why are there so many very
similar chipmunks in the West? The presence of tall
mountains interspersed with vast areas of arid
desert and grassland makes the West ecologically
far different from the East. The West affords much
more opportunity for chipmunk populations to
become geographically isolated from one another,
a condition of species formation. Also, there are
more extremes in western habitats. In the Sierra
Nevada, high elevations are close to low
elevations, at least in terms of mileage, but
ecologically they are very different.
Most ecologists believe that ancient populations of
chipmunks diverged genetically when isolated from
one another by mountains and unfavorable
ecological habitat. These scattered populations first
evolved into races—adapted to the local ecological
conditions—and then into species, reproductively
isolated from one another. This period of evolution
was relatively recent, as evidenced by the similar
appearance of all the western chipmunk species.
Ecologists have studied the four chipmunk species
that occur on the eastern slope of the Sierra and
have learned just how these species interact while
remaining separate, each occupying its own
elevational zone. The sagebrush chipmunk is found
at the lowest elevation, among the sagebrush. The
yellow pine chipmunk is common in low to midelevations and open conifer forests, including pinon
and ponderosa and Jeffrey pine forests. The
lodgepole chipmunk is found at higher elevations,
among the lodgepoles, firs, and high-elevation
pines. The alpine chipmunk is higher still, venturing
among the talus slopes, alpine meadows, and highelevation pines and junipers. Obviously, the ranges
of each species overlap. Why don't sagebrush
chipmunks move into the pine zones? Why don't
alpine chipmunks move to lower elevations and
share the conifer forests with lodgepole
chipmunks?
The answer, in one word, is aggression. Chipmunk
species actively defend their ecological zones from
encroachment by neighboring species. The yellow
pine chipmunk is more aggressive than the
sagebrush chipmunk, possibly because it is a bit
larger. It successfully bullies its smaller
evolutionary cousin, excluding it from the pine
forests. Experiments have shown that the
sagebrush chipmunk is physiologically able to live
anywhere in the Sierra Nevada, from high alpine
zones to the desert. The little creature is apparently
restricted to the desert not because it is specialized
to live only there but because that is the only
habitat where none of the other chipmunk species
can live. The fact that sagebrush chipmunks
tolerate very warm temperatures makes them, and
only them, able to live where they do. The
sagebrush chipmunk essentially occupies its
habitat by default. In one study, ecologists
established that yellow pine chipmunks actively
exclude sagebrush chipmunks from pine forests;
the ecologists simply trapped all the yellow pine
chipmunks in a section of forest and moved them
out. Sagebrush chipmunks immediately moved in,
but yellow pine chipmunks did not enter sagebrush
desert when sagebrush chipmunks were removed.
The most aggressive of the four eastern-slope
species is the lodgepole chipmunk, a feisty rodent
indeed. It actively prevents alpine chipmunks from
moving downslope, and yellow pine chipmunks
from moving upslope. There is logic behind the
lodge-pole's aggressive demeanor. It lives in the
cool, shaded conifer forests, and of the four
species, it is the least able to tolerate heat stress. It
is, in other words, the species of the strictest
habitat needs: it simply must be in those shaded
forests. However, if it shared its habitat with alpine
and yellow pine chipmunks, either or both of these
species might outcompete it, taking most of the
available food. Such a competition could effectively
eliminate lodgepole chipmunks from the habitat.
Lodgepoles survive only by virtue of their
aggression.

57 – 1 Pests and Pesticides
Around 1870, a little fruit-eating insect arrived in
San Jose, California, on some nursery stock
shipped from Asia. The pest, which became known
as the San Jose scale, quickly spread through the
United States and Canada, killing orchard trees as
it went. Farmers found that the best way to control
the scale was to spray their orchards with a mixture
of sulfur and lime. Within a few weeks of spraying a
tree, the insect vanished completely.
Around the turn of the century, however, farmers
began to notice that the sulfur-lime mixture was not
working all that well. A handful of scales would
survive a spraying and eventually rebound to their
former numbers. In Clarkston Valley in Washington
State, orchard growers became convinced that
manufacturers were adulterating their pesticide.
They built their own factory to guarantee a pure
poison, which they drenched over their trees, yet
the scale kept spreading uncontrollably. An
entomologist named A. L Melander inspected the
trees and found scales living happily under a thick
crust of dried spray.
Melander began to suspect that adulteration was
not to blame. In 1912, he compared how effective
the sprays were in different parts of Washington In
Yakima and Sunnyside, he found that sulfur-lime
could wipe out every last scale on a tree, while in
Clarkston between 4 and 13 percent survived. On
the other hand, the Clarkston scales were
annihilated by a different pesticide made from fuel
oil, just as the insects in other parts of Washington
were. In other words, the scales of Clarkston had a
peculiar resistance to sulfur-lime.
Melander wondered why He knew that if individuals
eat small amounts of certain poisons, such as
arsenic, they can build up an immunity. But San
Jose scales bred so quickly that no single scale
experienced more than a single spray of sulfurlime, giving them no chance to develop immunity.
A radical idea occurred to Melander Perhaps
mutations made a few scales resistant to sulfurlime. When farmers sprayed their trees, these
resistant scales survived, as did a few nonresistant
ones that hadn’t received a fatal dose. The
surviving scales would then breed, and the
resistant genes would become more common in
the following generations. Depending on the
proportions of the survivors, the trees might
become covered by resistant or nonresistant
scales. In the Clarkston Valley region, farmers had
been using sulfur-lime longer than anywhere else
in the Northwest and were desperately soaking
their trees with the stuff. In the process, they were
driving the evolution of more resistant scales.
Melander offered his ideas in 1914, but no one paid
much attention to him; they were too busy
discovering even more powerful pesticides. In 1939
the Swiss chemist Paul Muller found that a
compound of chlorine and hydrocarbons called
DDT could kill insects more effectively than any
previous pesticide had DDT was cheap and easy to
make, it could kill many species of insects, and it
was stable enough to be stored for years. It could
be used in small doses, and it didn’t seem to pose
any health risks to humans. Between 1941 and
1976, 4.5 million tons of DDT were produced DDT
was so powerful and cheap that farmers gave up
old-fashioned ways of controlling pests, such as
draining standing water or breeding resistant
strains of crops.
DDT and similar pesticides created the delusion
that pests could be not merely controlled but
eradicated, so farmers began spraying pesticides
on their crops as a matter of course, rather than to
control outbreaks Meanwhile, public health workers
saw in DDT the hope of controlling mosquitoes,
which spread diseases such as malaria.
DDT certainly saved a great many lives and crops,
but even in its early days, some scientists saw
signs of its doom. In 1946 Swedish scientists
discovered houseflies that could no longer be killed
with DDT Houseflies in other countries became
resistant as well in later years, and soon other
species could withstand it. Melander’s warning was
becoming a reality. By 1992 more than 500 species
were resistant to DDT, and the number is still
climbing. As DDT began to fail, farmers at first just
applied more of it; when more no longer worked,
they switched to newer pesticides.

57 – 2 The Debate over Spontaneous
Generation
Until the second half of the nineteenth century,
many scientists and philosophers believed that
some forms of life could arise spontaneously from
nonliving matter; they called this hypothetical
process spontaneous generation. Not much more
than 100 years ago, people commonly believed
that toads, snakes, and mice could be born of
moist soil; that flies could emerge from manure;
and that maggots, the larvae of flies, could arise
from decaying corpses.
A strong opponent of spontaneous generation, the
Italian physician Francesco Redi, set out in 1668 to
demonstrate that maggots did not arise
spontaneously from decaying meat. Redi filled
three jars with decaying meat and sealed them
tightly. Then he arranged three other jars similarly
but left them open. Maggots appeared in the open
vessels after flies entered the jars and laid their
eggs, but the sealed containers showed no signs of
maggots. Still, Redi’s antagonists were not
convinced; they claimed that fresh air was needed
for spontaneous generation. So Redi set up a
second experiment, in which three jars were
covered with a fine net instead of being sealed. No
larvae appeared in the net-covered jars, even
though air was present. Maggots appeared only
when flies were allowed to leave their eggs on the
meat.
Redi's results were a serious blow to the long-held
belief that large forms of life could arise from
nonlife. However, many scientists still believed that
tiny microorganisms were simple enough to be
generated from nonliving materials.
The case for spontaneous generation of
microorganisms seemed to be strengthened in
1745, when John Needham, an Englishman, found
that even after he heated nutrient fluids (chicken
broth and corn broth) before pouring them into
covered flasks, the cooled solutions were soon
teeming with microorganisms. Needham claimed
that microbes developed spontaneously from the
fluids. Twenty years later, Lazzaro Spallanzani an
Italian scientist, suggested that microorganisms
from the air probably had entered Needham's
solutions after they were boiled. Spallanzani
showed that nutrient fluids heated after being
sealed in a flask did not develop microbial growth.
Needham responded by claiming the “vital force”
necessary for spontaneous generation had been
destroyed by the heat and was kept out of the
flasks by the seals.
This intangible “vital force” was given all the more
credence shortly after Spallanzani's experiment,
when Laurent Lavoisier showed the importance of
oxygen to life Spallanzani's observations were
criticized on the grounds that there was not enough
oxygen in the sealed flasks to support microbial life.
The issue was still unresolved in 1858, when the
German scientist Rudolf Virchow challenged
spontaneous generation with the concept of
biogenesis, the claim that living cells can arise only
from preexisting living cells Arguments about
spontaneous generation continued until 1861,
when the work of the French scientist Louis
Pasteur ended the debate.
With a series of ingenious and persuasive
experiments, Pasteur demonstrated that
microorganisms are present in the air and can
contaminate sterile solutions, but air itself does not
create microbes. He filled several short-necked
flasks with beef broth and then boiled their
contents. Some were then left open and allowed to
cool. In a few days, these flasks were found to be
contaminated with microbes. The other flasks,
sealed after boiling, were free of microorganisms.
From these results, Pasteur reasoned that
microbes in the air were the agents responsible for
contaminating nonliving matter such as the broths
in Needham’s flasks.
Pasteur next placed broth in open-ended longnecked flasks and bent the necks into S-shaped
curves. The contents of these flasks were then
boiled and cooled. The broth in the flasks did not
decay and showed no signs of life, even after
months. Pasteur’s unique design allowed air to
pass into the flask, but the curved neck trapped
any airborne microorganisms that might have
contaminated the broth.
Pasteur showed that microorganisms can be
present in nonliving matter-on solids, in liquids, and
in the air. His work provided evidence that
microorganisms cannot originate from mysterious
forces present in nonliving materials. Rather, any
appearance of ‘‘spontaneous” life in nonliving
solutions can be attributed to microorganisms that
were already present in the air or in the fluids
themselves.
138
58 – 2 Pinyon Pines and Pinyon Jays
Organisms of different species frequently evolve
adaptations that make them utterly and specifically
dependent on each other for resources. For
example, many trees must have mycorrhizal fungi
living in their root systems, fungi that are
indispensable to the tree because they facilitate
mineral uptake from the soil. In turn, the fungi rely
on the trees to photosynthesize: they use some of
the tree's chemical food as their only energy
source. Such intimate relationships are examples
of coevolution through which two species become
so interdependent that they can thrive only in each
other’s presence.
At first glance, the relationship between pinyon
pine trees and the pinyon jay does not appear to be
one of coevolution. Pinyon pines produce cones
and seeds that attract seed predators, especially
the pinyon jay. A seed, of course, contains an
embryonic plant for the next generation. Why
sacrifice it to an animal? Some plants have
poisonous seeds, an obvious adaptation to reduce
loss to animals. Pinyons, however, have an array of
characteristics that combine to encourage jays to
visit the pines and help themselves to the seeds.
Cones are positioned upward and outward on the
tree, so the seeds inside are in plain sight of the
jays, essentially inviting them to partake Pinyon
seeds are unusually large, and each seed is high in
energy. The seed coat is thin, meaning that birds
such as pinyon jays can not only ingest the seeds
but also digest them. In many plants, an
indigestible seed coat permits the seed to pass
unharmed through the bird’s alimentary system.
Pinyon seed coats differ in color between edible
and nonviable seeds, signaling the jays as to which
they should select.
Attracting seed predators would not seem to be a
successful survival strategy for pinyon pines.
However, pinyon jays are behaviorally adapted to
bury any seeds in excess of their immediate
survival needs. This is a useful behavior for the
jays, providing they can retrieve some of the buried
seeds during winter, and good for the trees, as the
unretrieved seeds are ready to germinate. Still, for
the jays to bury any seeds, there must be an
abundance of seeds far beyond the jays’
immediate needs. One tree could never produce so
many seeds, but if all the pinyons in a region
produced heavy seed crops at once, they would
indeed “flood the market” with vastly more pinyon
seeds than the local population of jays could
consume In fact, that is exactly what the pinyon
pines do.
It requires a great deal of energy to make so many
seeds, so much energy that it is unlikely that a
pinyon population could produce such a bumper
seed crop every year. More important, however, it
would be to the severe disadvantage of the trees to
produce large seed crops annually, even if they
could. Doing so would make the resource not only
abundant but also predictable Seed predators
could, over the years, steadily build their
populations, eventually increasing so much that
they could, indeed, consume virtually all of the
seeds. It is much more adaptive for the plants to
produce seed cornucopias intermittently. Doing so
has several major advantages. First, energy can be
stored for some years and then devoted to cone
and seed production, ensuring adequate energy to
produce a large seed crop. Second, seed-predator
populations will decline in years of low seed
production, either through starvation, reduced
reproduction, or emigration. Pinyons in most areas
have a roughly six-year interval between heavy
seed crops.
Pinyon jays have so completely adapted to the
cycle of the pinyons that their reproduction is tied to
it. Most species of birds mature sexually in
response to changes in day length. In pinyon jays,
however, day length is only one stimulus for
reproduction. The other cue is availability of pinyon
seeds. When seeds are abundant, jays can breed
very early in spring continue breeding through
summer, and reenter breeding condition as early
as the winter solstice. So the jay population
temporarily enlarges in response to one of the
intermittent large crops of pinyon seeds. But the
increase in the population of jays is less than the
increase in the size of the seed crop. Thus many of
the seeds of a bumper crop are buried and
subsequently germinate, many more than would
germinate without planting by the jays.

58 – 4 Cetacean Intelligence
We often hear that whales, dolphins, and porpoises
are as intelligent as humans maybe even more so.
Are they really that smart? There is no question
that cetaceans are among the most intelligent of
animals. Dolphins, killer whales, and pilot whales in
captivity quickly learn tricks. The military has
trained bottlenose dolphins to find bombs and
missile heads and to work as underwater spies.
This type of learning, however, is called
conditioning. The animal simply learns that when it
performs a particular behavior, it gets a reward,
usually a fish. Many animals, including rats, birds,
and even invertebrates, can be conditioned to
perform tricks. We certainly don't think of these
animals as our mental rivals. Unlike most other
animals, however, dolphins quickly learn by
observations and may spontaneously imitate
human activities. One tame dolphin watched a
diver cleaning an underwater viewing window,
seized a feather in its beak, and began imitating
the diver—complete with sound effects! Dolphins
have also been seen imitating seals, turtles, and
even water-skiers.
Given the seeming intelligence of cetaceans,
people are always tempted to compare them with
humans and other animals. Studies on
discrimination and problem-solving skills in the
bottlenose dolphin, for instance, have concluded
that its intelligence lies "somewhere between that
of a dog and a chimpanzee." Such comparisons
are unfair. It is important to realize that intelligence
is a very human concept and that we evaluate it in
human terms. After all, not many people would
consider themselves stupid because they couldn't
locate and identify a fish by its echo. Why should
we judge cetaceans by their ability to solve human
problems?
Both humans and cetaceans have large brains with
an expanded and distinctively folded surface, the
cortex. The cortex is the dominant association
center of the brain, where abilities such as memory
and sensory perception are centered. Cetaceans
have larger brains than ours, but the ratio of brain
to body weight is higher in humans. Again, direct
comparisons are misleading. In cetaceans it is
mainly the portions of the brain associated with
hearing and the processing of sound information
that are expanded. The enlarged portions of our
brain deal largely with vision and hand-eye
coordination. Cetaceans and humans almost
certainly perceive the world in very different ways.
Their world is largely one of sounds, ours one of
sights.
Contrary to what is depicted in movies and on
television, the notion of "talking" to dolphins is also
misleading. Although they produce a rich repertoire
of complex sounds, they lack vocal cords and their
brains probably process sound differently from
ours. Bottlenose dolphins have been trained to
make sounds through the blowhole that sound
something like human sounds, but this is a far cry
from human speech. By the same token, humans
cannot make whale sounds. We will probably never
be able to carry on an unaided conversation with
cetaceans.
As in chimpanzees, captive bottlenose dolphins
have been taught American Sign Language. These
dolphins have learned to communicate with trainers
who use sign language to ask simple questions.
Dolphins answer back by pushing a "yes" or "no"
paddle. They have even been known to give
spontaneous responses not taught by the trainers.
Evidence also indicates that these dolphins can
distinguish between commands that differ from
each other only by their word order, a truly
remarkable achievement. Nevertheless, dolphins
do not seem to have a real language like ours.
Unlike humans, dolphins probably cannot convey
very complex messages.
Observations of cetaceans in the wild have
provided some insights on their learning abilities.
Several bottlenose dolphins off western Australia,
for instance, have been observed carrying large
cone-shaped sponges over their beaks. They
supposedly use the sponges for protection against
stingrays and other hazards on the bottom as they
search for fish to eat. This is the first record of the
use of tools among wild cetaceans.
Instead of "intelligence," some people prefer to
speak of "awareness." In any case, cetaceans
probably have a very different awareness and
perception of their environment than do humans.
Maybe one day we will come to understand
cetaceans on their terms instead of ours, and
perhaps we will discover a mental sophistication
rivaling our own.

64 – 1 Characteristics of Pterosaurs
The extinct flying reptiles called pterosaurs were
the second group of animals (after insects) to
evolve flight. Most pterosaurs were about the size
of modern seagulls. A few were as small as
sparrows, but some of the later species were the
largest flying animals that have ever lived. In 1817,
Theodore Von Soemmerring published the first
description of a pterosaur fossil, and thinking that it
was that of an unusual bat species, he drew his
reconstruction with a very batlike posture and wing.
His early reconstruction of a pterosaur has haunted
the public and scientific perception of pterosaurs
ever since. Soemmerring's reconstruction is
understandable given that he was the first to try to
describe a pterosaur, that few naturalists of the
time accepted the idea of major groups of extinct
animals, and that both pterosaurs‘ and bats‘ wings
consist of a membrane supported by enormously
elongated finger bones. Soemmerring showed his
pterosaur with the laterally directed legs and
reoriented feet of bats and with the wing membrane
stretching from the arm and finger along the sides
of the body and legs all the way to the ankle. The
reconstruction also included a membrane
stretching between the legs, similar to that in bats.
Even though other scientists developed less batlike
descriptions of pterosaurs in the late 1800s, the
popular literature, and even some scientific
literature, continued to describe pterosaurs as
batlike into the 1980s.
Bats perch by hanging upside down from tree limbs
and roofs of caves. Though many are surprisingly
agile climbers, bats are generally awkward when
crawling on level surfaces. Did pterosaurs also
hang upside down and avoid landing on the
ground? Until recently, some paleontologists
thought they did, but most scientists now agree that
pterosaurs got around on the ground reasonably
well. What is still uncertain is whether pterosaurs
walked on all fours or just on their hindlegs.
Pterosaurs' ancestors were bipedal (two-footed)
and used their tails to balance their forward-tilted
trunks and heads. Early pterosaurs also had long
tails and probably could have run on their hindlegs,
certainly handy for an animal with wings for
forelimbs. These early pterosaurs, however, could
have used their forelimbs for walking because their
arm and hand bones were only slightly enlarged—
most of the wing was supported by the gigantic
fourth finger.
Later pterosaurs are more enigmatic: their arms
and especially their hands seem too long to be
used comfortably for walking, but their tails were
too short to counterbalance their bodies if they
walked just on their hindlegs. Birds also have short,
stubby tail skeletons, but they manage to walk
quite well on their hindlegs. Birds manage this by
angling the thighs forward to get their feet under
the body's center of gravity. They hold their thighs
at this unstable angle with extensive hip and thigh
muscles. Some researchers have suggested that
pterosaurs' hipbones were too small to anchor
extensive thigh-positioning muscles, but others
have responded that pterosaurs' leg and foot bones
are so strikingly birdlike that pterosaurs must surely
have walked like birds. Recently, however, some
pterosaur experts have concluded that a number of
fossil trackways—trails of preserved footprints—
were made by pterydactyloid pterosaurs, and these
animals clearly walked on all four limbs. Perhaps
some early pterosaurs walked on their hindlegs,
but according to current evidence, most species
probably walked on all fours. In any case, large
pterosaurs, with eight or ten-meter wingspans and
weighing as much as an adult human, do not seem
likely candidates for a batlike existence confined to
clambering about in trees and hanging upside
down from branches.
Pterosaurs also possessed some obvious
adaptations for powered flight. They had large
sternums (breastbones) for attaching powerful flight
muscles, well-developed shoulder bones to carry
the body's weight in flight, and air-filled bones to
lighten the skeleton. Some even had a furcula (a
fused breastbone also found in birds): perhaps to
flex like a spring and help raise the wings during
the upstroke. How competent were they at flying?
The original batlike reconstructions, along with their
classification as reptiles, suggested to many earlier
biologists that pterosaurs were only gliders.
Biologists now, however, generally agree that
pterosaurs were capable of powered, flapping
flight. Indeed, the shoulder joint is clearly
specialized for the down-and-forward, up-and-back
movement of normal flapping.

66 – 3 What is Coral?
Corals belong to a group of animals called
cnidarians. This group encompasses hard and soft
corals, sea fans, gorgonians, hydroids, jellyfish,
and sea anemones. Although the group is
remarkably diverse, there are a few features
shared by all. They have a free-swimming larval
stage and a simple body plan: a central mouth,
through which material passes in and out of the
body, and a ring of tentacles. The other
distinguishing feature of the cnidarians is the
presence of nematocysts (stinging cells), which are
used to catch prey.
Individual corals are known as coral polyps: each is
a single animal. In isolation a coral polyp looks very
similar to a sea anemone, but unlike sea
anemones, which live separated from each other,
corals form colonies. A few species remain solitary,
but in most cases, new polyps bud off the initial
founding polyp, and gradually colonies of
thousands or even millions of polyps will grow,
each connected to its neighbors by living tissue.
Freed from the limitations of living alone, colonies
can grow to immense sizes and live a very long
time.
Corals come in all shapes and sizes, but the basic
plan is the same, polyps live as a surface layer on
some sort of structure, be it hard and inflexible or
rubbery. The hard, or true corals, for which reefs
are most famous, build limestone skeletons
beneath the living tissue. Soft corals, as their name
implies, do not form solid skeletons; instead they
secrete limestone crystal structures called sclerites,
which are embedded within a jellylike matrix
beneath the polyps. When they die, little is left of
most soft corals as the limestone element of their
makeup is so small and easily breaks up.
By contrast, some sea whips and fans and,
notably, the black corals, have such dense
skeletons of limestone, protein, and minerals that
they are highly durable and are collected and
polished for jewelry. The skeleton of black corals is
more dense the slower it grows, and it grows more
slowly at depth. So it is the very deep, older
colonies that are most highly prized.
Coral reefs would not exist if it were not for the
ability of coral polyps to secrete limestone or
calcium carbonate. Sea water surrounding a coral
is very rich in dissolved calcium carbonate, but the
fluid inside the polyp cannot retain a large quantity
of calcium carbonate, so it is laid down as
microscopic needle-shaped crystals beneath and
around the polyp. This process occurs in two
stages. As the polyp expands to feed with its
tentacles at night, it lifts off the skeleton, rather like
a glove coming part way off a hand. At this stage,
the calcium carbonate crystals form ridges. During
the following day (when the coral polyp is retracted
and lying on its new structure), the valleys between
the ridges fill in with more calcium carbonate and
the skeleton takes on a smoother appearance.
Because the skeleton of hard corals is made of
limestone or calcium carbonate, it is pure white.
Each coral species lays down its skeleton in a
different way. This gives rise to the extraordinary
range of shapes and forms that hard corals take.
Some form large boulders, where the polyps live in
small, isolated depressions or grooves in the
skeleton. Some grow in branches, which can be
small and stubby, while others are spreading,
treelike structures. Still others grow delicate,
leaflike plates or flat tables. The range is huge, and
to complicate the matter further, the same species
will grow in a different way depending on the
physical characteristics of the place in which it finds
itself. Although a coral's genetic blueprint is
fundamental in determining what it looks like, its
appearance is also affected by waves, currents,
light, and competition for space on the reef. Such
variations in coral form have complicated the
matter of identification over the years.

65 – 1 The Pit Organs of Snakes
It is thought that the facial pits or pit organs on the
head of some snakes are specialized infrared
(heat) receptors. When a rattlesnake strikes, the
direction of the strike seems to be guided by the
infrared radiation from its prey. A rattlesnake strikes
only at warm-blooded prey, and when the prey is
dead and at room temperature, the snake will not
strike. However, a blindfolded snake strikes
correctly at a dead rat that is pulled across the
cage, provided the rat is warmer than the
surroundings. Blindfolded, the snake cannot be
guided by vision; nor is it guided by the sense of
smell, for it will strike correctly even at a moving,
cloth-wrapped electric bulb. The pit organs are
evidently involved in sensing the location of warm
objects. All snakes that have pit organs feed
preferentially on warm-blooded prey, and this
further supports the view that these organs are
infrared sensors. In the rattlesnake the pit organs
are located, one on each side, between the nostril
and the eye: they are connected to many nerves,
and this in itself suggests a sensory role for the
organ.
The sensitivity of the facial pit has been examined
by recording the activity in the nerve leading from
the organ. A variety of stimuli, such as sound,
vibration, or light of moderate intensity (with the
infrared part of the spectrum filtered out), has no
detectable effect on the activity in the nerve.
However, if objects of a temperature different from
the surroundings are brought into the receptive
field around the head, there is a striking change in
nerve activity, regardless of the temperature of the
intervening air.
How is the infrared radiation sensed? The pit is
covered by a thin transparent membrane, and it
has been suggested that a rise in temperature in
the pit behind the membrane could cause an
expansion of the gas with a consequent
deformation of the membrane. This in turn could be
sensed by a suitable receptor. This hypothesis is
highly improbable, for a cut in the membrane that
opens the pit to the outside air causes no loss in
responsiveness, a result that is incompatible with
the hypothesis that a pressure change is sensed.
We are left with two other possibilities to consider:
Either the effect is photochemical, which means
that the infrared radiation is absorbed by a specific
compound, analogous to the light- sensitive
pigments in the eye, or the pit organs are sensitive
to the slight temperature rise caused when infrared
radiation reaches it. The infrared radiation emitted
from a mammalian body has low quantum energy,
which makes any photochemical effect on a
pigment extremely unlikely. Pure infrared radiation
can be produced by a laser, and experiments with
such radiation of known wavelength provide strong
evidence that the mode of reception in the facial pit
organ is entirely thermal.
Can the pit organs be used for perception of the
infrared source in the way our two eyes are used
for stereoscopic vision? This seems likely, not only
from observations of the precision with which a
snake can strike, but also from studies of its brain
activity. When infrared radiation falls on the facial
pit organ, electric activity can be recorded from the
optic tectum, the part of the brain with which the
optic nerve is connected. This in itself is
suggestive; although the nerves from the pit organ
are completely separate from the optic nerves, the
same part of the brain seems to handle visual
information, which is known to be stereoscopic, and
infrared information. The optic tectum has left and
right parts, located on either side of the brain. Each
part receives input from each eye via the optic
chiasma, the point at which the optic nerves from
the left and right eye meet. Many of the neurons in
the tectum respond to stimulation of the pit organ
on the opposite side of the head. This is
reminiscent of the way information from the eyes is
handled; the crossover of the optic nerve in the
optic chiasma is essential for stereoscopic vision
and interpretation of distance. Information from the
two pit organs is apparently coordinated and
interpreted in a similar way, a conclusion in
agreement with recorded changes in the neural
activity in the tectum when the infrared source is in
a position to irradiate both pits at once. It therefore
appears that the facial pits indeed provide
stereoscopic perception and substantially aid in the
precision of estimating the location of prey.

69 – 1 Why Snakes Have Forked Tongues
The forked tongue of snakes has intrigued people
for millennia, inspiring many hypotheses. In many
cultures and religions, the forked tongue
symbolizes malevolence and deceit. The first
person known to inquire about the functional
significance of the forked tongue was Aristotle; he
suggested that it would double the pleasure of
sensations of taste. By the beginning of the
twentieth century, the consensus was that the
snake’s tongue is a tactile organ, that is, the snake
uses it to tap the group much as a blind person
uses a cane.
In 1920, Broman suggested what seemed to be a
winning hypothesis: When the snake retracts its
tongue, the tips (or tines) of the forked tongue are
inserted into openings on both sides of the roof of
the mouth, through these openings chemical stimuli
reach special organs that help snakes detect
smells – the vemeronasal organs (VNO). These
organs are highly developed in snakes, lizards, and
many mammals. They are a second system for
detecting smells that appear to have evolved
specifically to detect pheromones, the chemical
signals that animals secrete as messages to other
animals of their species. Broman suggested that
forked tongue flicks out, picking up chemical
signals, and then delivers these to the VNO. This
hypothesis was widely accepted into the 1980s.
Then X-ray movie studies of tongue flicks in snakes
and lizards with forked tongue disproved the
hypothesis; they showed that when the tongue is
withdrawn into the mouth, it enters a sheath and
the tips do not go into the openings to the VNO.
Instead, the chemical molecules are deposited on
pads at the bottom of the mouth, and closing the
mouth presses the pads and molecules against the
opening.
If the tongue is not forked to fit into the VNO, then
what function could the forked shape serve?
Schwenk proposes a solution that encompasses
observations from several fields – animal
behavior, ecology, sensory physiology, and
neuroanatomy. He hypothesizes that the forked
tongue allows the snake to sense chemical stimuli
at two points simultaneously, thereby giving it the
ability to detect differences in an odor trail.
Obtaining two simultaneous readings enhances the
ability of the snake to detect the edges of odor
trails, and thus to follow pheromone trails
accurately. This ability is important in seeking both
prey and mates.
This spatial chemical perception is like other
systems for spatial perception that are based on
simultaneous stimulation of two separated sense
organs – for example, auditory localization, which
depends on differential stimulation at the two ears.
Similarly, the use of two eyes permits stereovision.
Several kinds of evidence support the hypothesis
that forked tongues evolved as chemosensory
edge detectors to enhance the ability to follow odor
trails: Snakes and lizards spread the tines of their
tongue apart when they retrieve odor molecules,
then draw the tines together when retracting the
tongue. The greater the distance between sampling
points, the better the animals sample differences
within an odor trail. Lizards that forage widely have
forked tongues, whereas lizard species without
forked tongues tend not to forage widely. Forked
tongues have evolved independently at least twice
in different families of reptiles, indicating their value
as an adaption. In the snake nervous system, each
tine of the tongue is linked to a nucleus in the other
side of the brain, and the two nuclei are linked
across the two hemispheres. This arrangement is
similar to the anatomy of auditory centers in
mammals and birds that permits the computation of
differences between what one ear hears and what
the other ear hears and thus mediates auditory
localization.
Species in other orders have also evolved paired
chemical receptors to guide individuals to mates or
prey. For example, male gypsy moths have large,
elaborate, odor-detecting antennae with which they
track potential mates over large distances, and the
ant nest beetle has spoon-shaped antennae
extending from each side of the head with which it
detects and follows the pheromones of the ants
that are its food.

PHOTOGRAPHY / THEATER /
CINAMA
01 – 2 The Origins of Theater
In seeking to describe the origins of theater, one
must rely primarily on speculation, since there is
little concrete evidence on which to draw. The most
widely accepted theory, championed by
anthropologists in the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries, envisions theater as emerging
out of myth and ritual. The process perceived by
these anthropologists may be summarized briefly.
During the early stages of its development, a
society becomes aware of forces that appear to
influence or control its food supply and well-being.
Having little understanding of natural causes, it
attributes both desirable and undesirable
occurrences to supernatural or magical forces, and
it searches for means to win the favor of these
forces. Perceiving an apparent connection between
certain actions performed by the group and the
result it desires, the group repeats, refines and
formalizes those actions into fixed ceremonies, or
rituals.
Stories (myths) may then grow up around a ritual.
Frequently the myths include representatives of
those supernatural forces that the rites celebrate or
hope to influence. Performers may wear costumes
and masks to represent the mythical characters or
supernatural forces in the rituals or in
accompanying celebrations. As a person becomes
more sophisticated, its conceptions of supernatural
forces and causal relationships may change. As a
result, it may abandon or modify some rites. But the
myths that have grown up around the rites may
continue as part of the group's oral tradition and
may even come to be acted out under conditions
divorced from these rites. When this occurs, the
first step has been taken toward theater as an
autonomous activity, and thereafter entertainment
and aesthetic values may gradually replace the
former mystical and socially efficacious concerns.
Although origin in ritual has long been the most
popular, it is by no means the only theory about
how the theater came into being. Storytelling has
been proposed as one alternative. Under this
theory, relating and listening to stories are seen as
fundamental human pleasures. Thus, the recalling
of an event (a hunt, battle, or other feat) is
elaborated through the narrator's pantomime and
impersonation and eventually through each role
being assumed by a different person.
A closely related theory sees theater as evolving
out of dances that are primarily pantomimic,
rhythmical or gymnastic, or from imitations of
animal noises and sounds. Admiration for the
performer's skill, virtuosity, and grace are seen as
motivation for elaborating the activities into fully
realized theatrical performances.
In addition to exploring the possible antecedents of
theater, scholars have also theorized about the
motives that led people to develop theater. Why did
theater develop, and why was it valued after it
ceased to fulfill the function of ritual? Most answers
fall back on the theories about the human mind and
basic human needs. One, set forth by Aristotle in
the fourth century B.C., sees humans as naturally
imitative-as taking pleasure in imitating persons,
things, and actions and in seeing such imitations.
Another, advanced in the twentieth century,
suggests that humans have a gift for fantasy,
through which they seek to reshape reality into
more satisfying forms than those encountered in
daily life. Thus, fantasy or fiction (of which drama is
one form) permits people to objectify their anxieties
and fears, confront them, and fulfill their hopes in
fiction if not fact. The theater, then, is one tool
whereby people define and understand their world
or escape from unpleasant realities.
But neither the human imitative instinct nor a
penchant for fantasy by itself leads to an
autonomous theater. Therefore, additional
explanations are needed. One necessary condition
seems to be a somewhat detached view of human
problems. For example, one sign of this condition is
the appearance of the comic vision, since comedy
requires sufficient detachment to view some
deviations from social norms as ridiculous rather
than as serious threats to the welfare of the entire
group. Another condition that contributes to the
development of autonomous theater is the
emergence of the aesthetic sense. For example,
some early societies ceased to consider certain
rites essential to their well-being and abandoned
them, nevertheless, they retained as parts of their
oral tradition the myths that had grown up around
the rites and admired them for their artistic qualities
rather than for their religious usefulness.

02 – 3 Early Cinema
The cinema did not emerge as a form of mass
consumption until its technology evolved from the
initial "peepshow" format to the point where images
were projected on a screen in a darkened theater.
In the peepshow format, a film was viewed through
a small opening in a machine that was created for
that purpose. Thomas Edison' s peepshow device,
the Kinetoscope, was introduced to the public in
1894. It was designed for use in Kinetoscope
parlors, or arcades, which contained only a few
individual machines and permitted only one
customer to view a short, 50-foot film at any one
time. The first Kinetoscope parlors contained five
machines. For the price of 25 cents (or 5 cents per
machine), customers moved from machine to
machine to watch five different films (or, in the case
of famous prizefights, successive rounds of a single
fight).
These Kinetoscope arcades were modeled on
phonograph parlors, which had proven successful
for Edison several years earlier. In the phonograph
parlors, customers listened to recordings through
individual ear tubes, moving from one machine to
the next to hear different recorded speeches or
pieces of music. The Kinetoscope parlors
functioned in a similar way. Edison was more
interested in the sale of Kinetoscopes (for roughly
$1,000 apiece) to these parlors than in the films
that would be run in them (which cost
approximately $10 to $15 each). He refused to
develop projection technology, reasoning that if he
made and sold projectors, then exhibitors would
purchase only one machine-a projector-from him
instead of several.
Exhibitors, however, wanted to maximize their
profits, which they could do more readily by
projecting a handful of films to hundreds of
customers at a time (rather than one at a time) and
by charging 25 to 50 cents admission. About a year
after the opening of the first Kinetoscope parlor in
1894, showmen such as Louis and Auguste
Lumiere, Thomas Armat and Charles Francis
Jenkins, and Orville and Woodville Latham (with
the assistance of Edison's former assistant, William
Dickson) perfected projection devices. These early
projection devices were used in vaudeville
theaters, legitimate theaters, local town halls,
makeshift storefront theaters, fairgrounds, and
amusement parks to show films to a mass
audience.
With the advent of projection in 1895-1896, motion
pictures became the ultimate form of mass
consumption. Previously, large audiences had
viewed spectacles at the theater, where vaudeville,
popular dramas, musical and minstrel shows,
classical plays, lectures, and slide-and-lantern
shows had been presented to several hundred
spectators at a time. But the movies differed
significantly from these other forms of
entertainment, which depended on either live
performance or (in the case of the slide-and-lantern
shows) the active involvement of a master of
ceremonies who assembled the final program.
Although early exhibitors regularly accompanied
movies with live acts, the substance of the movies
themselves is mass-produced, prerecorded
material that can easily be reproduced by theaters
with little or no active participation by the exhibitor.
Even though early exhibitors shaped their film
programs by mixing films and other entertainments
together in whichever way they thought would be
most attractive to audiences or by accompanying
them with lectures, their creative control remained
limited. What audiences came to see was the
technological marvel of the movies: the lifelike
reproduction of the commonplace motion of trains,
of waves striking the shore, and of people walking
in the street, and the magic made possible by trick
photography and the manipulation of the camera.
With the advent of projection, the viewer's
relationship with the image was no longer private,
as it had been with earlier peepshow devices such
as the Kinetoscope and the Mutoscope, which was
a similar machine that reproduced motion by
means of successive images on individual
photographic cards instead of on strips of celluloid.
It suddenly became public-an experience that the
viewer shared with dozens, scores, and even
hundreds of others. At the same time, the image
that the spectator looked at expanded from the
minuscule peepshow dimensions of 1 or 2 inches
(in height) to the life-size proportions of 6 or 9 feet.
146
12 – 2 Transition to Sound in Film
The shift from silent to sound film at the end of the
1920s marks, so far, the most important
transformation in motion picture history. Despite all
the highly visible technological developments in
theatrical and home delivery of the moving image
that have occurred over the decades since then, no
single innovation has come close to being regarded
as a similar kind of watershed. In nearly every
language, however, the words are phrased, the
most basic division in cinema history lies between
films that are mute and films that speak.
Yet this most fundamental standard of historical
periodization conceals a host of paradoxes. Nearly
every movie theater, however modest, had a piano
or organ to provide musical accompaniment to
silent pictures. In many instances, spectators in the
era before recorded sound experienced elaborate
aural presentations alongside movies’ visual
images, from the Japanese benshi (narrators)
crafting multivoiced dialogue narratives to original
musical compositions performed by symphony-size
orchestras in Europe and the United States. In
Berlin, for the premiere performance outside the
Soviet Union of The Battleship Potemkin, film
director Sergei Eisenstein worked with Austrian
composer Edmund Meisel (1874-1930) on a
musical score matching sound to image; the Berlin
screenings with live music helped to bring the film
its wide international fame.
Beyond that, the triumph of recorded sound has
overshadowed the rich diversity of technological
and aesthetic experiments with the visual image
that were going forward simultaneously in the
1920s. New color processes, larger or differently
shaped screen sizes, multiple-screen projections,
even television, were among the developments
invented or tried out during the period, sometimes
with startling success. The high costs of converting
to sound and the early limitations of sound
technology were among the factors that
suppressed innovations or retarded advancement
in these other areas. The introduction of new
screen formats was put off for a quarter century,
and color, though utilized over the next two
decades for special productions, also did not
become a norm until the 1950s.
Though it may be difficult to imagine from a later
perspective, a strain of critical opinion in the 1920s
predicted that sound film would be a technical
novelty that would soon fade from sight, just as had
many previous attempts, dating well back before
the First World War, to link images with recorded
sound. These critics were making a common
assumption—that the technological inadequacies
of earlier efforts (poor synchronization, weak sound
amplification, fragile sound recordings) would
invariably occur again. To be sure, their evaluation
of the technical flaws in 1920s sound experiments
was not so far off the mark, yet they neglected to
take into account important new forces in the
motion picture field that, in a sense, would not take
no for an answer.
These forces were the rapidly expanding
electronics and telecommunications companies
that were developing and linking telephone and
wireless technologies in the 1920s. In the United
States, they included such firms as American
Telephone and Telegraph, General Electric, and
Westinghouse. They were interested in all forms of
sound technology and all potential avenues for
commercial exploitation. Their competition and
collaboration were creating the broadcasting
industry in the United States, beginning with the
introduction of commercial radio programming in
the early 1920s. With financial assets considerably
greater than those in the motion picture industry,
and perhaps a wider vision of the relationships
among entertainment and communications media,
they revitalized research into recording sound for
motion pictures.
In 1929 the United States motion picture industry
released more than 300 sound films—a rough
figure, since a number were silent films with music
tracks, or films prepared in dual versions, to take
account of the many cinemas not yet wired for
sound. At the production level, in the United States
the conversion was virtually complete by 1930. In
Europe it took a little longer, mainly because there
were more small producers for whom the costs of
sound were prohibitive, and in other parts of the
world problems with rights or access to equipment
delayed the shift to sound production for a few
more years (though cinemas in major cities may
have been wired in order to play foreign sound
films). The triumph of sound cinema was swift,
complete, and enormously popular.

22 – 2 The Birth of Photography
Perceptions of the visible world were greatly altered
by the invention of photography in the middle of the
nineteenth century. In particular, and quite logically,
the art of painting was forever changed, though not
always in the ways one might have expected. The
realistic and naturalistic painters of the mid- and
late-nineteenth century were all intently aware of
photography — as a thing to use, to learn from,
and react to.
Unlike most major inventions, photography had
been long and impatiently awaited. The images
produced by the camera obscura, a boxlike device
that used a pinhole or lens to throw an image onto
a ground-glass screen or a piece of white paper,
were already familiar — the device had been much
employed by topographical artists like the Italian
painter Canaletto in his detailed views of the city of
Venice. What was lacking was a way of giving such
images permanent form. This was finally achieved
by Louis Daguerre (1787-1851), who perfected a
way of fixing them on a silvered copper plate. His
discovery, the “daguerreotype”, was announced in
1839.
A second and very different process was patented
by the British inventor William Henry Talbot (1800-
1877) in 1841. Talbot’s “calotype” was the first
negative-to-positive process and the direct
ancestor of the modern photograph. The calotype
was revolutionary in its use of chemically treated
paper in which areas hit by light became dark in
tone, producing a negative image. This “negative”,
as Talbot called it, could then be used to print
multiple positive images on another piece of
treated paper.
The two processes produced very different results.
The daguerreotype was a unique image that
reproduced what was in front of the camera lens in
minute, unselective detail and could not be
duplicated. The calotype could be made in series,
and was thus the equivalent of an etching or an
engraving. Its general effect was soft edged and
tonal.
One of the things that most impressed the original
audience for photography was the idea of
authenticity. Nature now seemed able to speak for
itself, with a minimum of interference. The title
Talbot chose for his book, The Pencil of Nature (the
first part of which was published in 1844), reflected
this feeling. Artists were fascinated by photography
because it offered a way of examining the world in
much greater detail. They were also afraid of it,
because it seemed likely to make their own efforts
unnecessary.
Photography did indeed make certain kinds of
painting obsolete — the daguerreotype virtually did
away with the portrait miniature. It also made the
whole business of making and owning images
democratic. Portraiture, once a luxury for the
privileged few, was suddenly well within the reach
of many more people.
In the long term, photography’s impact on the
visual arts was far from simple. Because the
medium was so prolific, in the sense that it was
possible to produce a multitude of images very
cheaply, it was soon treated as the poor relation of
fine art, rather than its destined successor. Even
those artists who were most dependent on
photography became reluctant to admit that they
made use of it, in case this compromised their
professional standing.
The rapid technical development of photography —
the introduction of lighter and simpler equipment,
and of new emulsions that coated photographic
plates, film, and paper and enabled images to be
made at much faster speeds — had some
unanticipated consequences. Scientific
experiments made by photographers such as
Eadweard Muybridge (1830-1904) and EtienneJules Marey (1830-1904) demonstrated that the
movements of both humans and animals differed
widely from the way they had been traditionally
represented in art. Artists, often reluctantly, were
forced to accept the evidence provided by the
camera. The new candid photography — unposed
pictures that were made when the subjects were
unaware that their pictures were being taken —
confirmed these scientific results, and at the same
time, thanks to the radical cropping (trimming) of
images that the camera often imposed, suggested
new compositional formats. The accidental effects
obtained by candid photographers were soon being
copied by artists such as the French painter Degas.
148
44 – 2 The Use of the Camera Obscura
The precursor of the modern camera, the camera
obscura is a darkened enclosure into which light is
admitted through a lens in a small hole. The image
of the illuminated area outside the enclosure is
thrown upside down as if by magic onto a surface
in the darkened enclosure. This technique was
known as long ago as the fifth century B.C. in
China. Aristotle also experimented with it in the
fourth century B.C., and Leonardo da Vinci
described it in his notebooks in 1490. In 1558
Giovanni Battista Della Porta wrote in his twentyvolume work Magia naturalis (meaning "natural
magic") instructions for adding a convex lens to
improve the quality of the image thrown against a
canvas or panel in the darkened area where its
outlines could be traced. Later, portable camera
obscuras were developed, with interior mirrors and
drawing tables on which the artist could trace the
image. For the artist, this technique allows forms
and linear perspective to be drawn precisely as
they would be seen from a single viewpoint. Mirrors
were also used to reverse projected images to their
original positions.
Did some of the masters of painting, then, trace
their images using a camera obscura? Some art
historians are now looking for clues of artists' use
of such devices. One of the artists whose paintings
are being analyzed from this point of view is the
great Dutch master, Jan Vermeer, who lived from
1632 to 1675 during the flowering of art and
science in the Netherlands, including the science of
optics. Vermeer produced only about 30 known
paintings, including his famous The Art of Painting.
The room shown in it closely resembles the room in
other Vermeer paintings, with lighting coming from
a window on the left, the same roof beams, and
similar floor tiles, suggesting that the room was
fitted with a camera obscura on the side in the
foreground. The map hung on the opposite wall
was a real map in Vermeer's possession,
reproduced in such faithful detail that some kind of
tracery is suspected. When one of Vermeer’s
paintings was X-rayed, it did not have any
preliminary sketches on the canvas beneath the
paint, but rather the complete image drawn in black
and white without any trial sketches. Vermeer did
not have any students, did not keep any records,
and did not encourage anyone to visit his studio,
facts that can be interpreted as protecting his
secret use of a camera obscura.
In recent times the British artist David Hockney has
published his investigations into the secret use of
the camera obscura, claiming that for up to 400
years, many of Western art’s great masters
probably used the device to produce almost
photographically realistic details in their paintings.
He includes in this group Caravaggio, Hans
Holbein, Leonardo da Vinci, Diego Velazquez.
Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, Agnolo Bronzino,
and Jan van Eyck. From an artist’s point of view,
Hockney observed that a camera obscura
compresses the complicated forms of a threedimensional scene into two-dimensional shapes
that can easily be traced and also increases the
contrast between light and dark, leading to the
chiaroscuro effect seen in many of these paintings.
In Jan van Eyck’s The Marriage of Giovanni
Arnolfini and Giovanna Cenami, the complicated
foreshortening in the chandelier and the intricate
detail in the bride's garments are among the clues
that Hockney thinks point to the use of the camera
obscura.
So what are we to conclude? If these artists did
use a camera obscura, does that diminish their
stature? Hockney argues that the camera obscura
does not replace artistic skill in drawing and
painting. In experimenting with it, he found that it is
actually quite difficult to use for drawing, and he
speculates that the artists probably combined their
observations from life with tracing of shapes.

57 – 3 The Problem of Narrative Clarity in Silent
Films
Beginning in 1904. American commercial
filmmaking became increasingly oriented toward
storytelling. Moreover, with the new emphasis on
one-reel films, narratives became longer and
necessitated a series of camera shots. Filmmakers
faced the challenge of making story films that
would be comprehensible to audiences. How could
techniques of editing, camerawork, acting, and
lighting be combined so as to clarify what was
happening in a film? How could the spectator grasp
where and when the action was occurring?
Over the span of several years, filmmakers solved
such problems Sometimes they influenced each
other, while at other times two filmmakers might
happen on the same technique independently
Some devices were tried and abandoned. By 1917,
filmmakers had worked out a system of formal
principles that were standard in American
filmmaking. That system has come to be called the
classical Hollywood cinema. Despite that name,
many of the basic principles of the system were
being worked out before filmmaking was centered
in Hollywood and, indeed, many of those principles
were first tried in other countries. In the years
before the First World War, film style was still
largely international, since films circulated widely
outside their country of origin.
The basic problem that confronted filmmakers early
in the silent-movie era was that audiences could
not understand the causal, spatial, and temporal
relations in many films If the editing abruptly
changed locales, the spectator might not grasp
where the new action was occurring. An actor's
elaborate pantomime might fail to convey the
meaning of a crucial action. A review of a 1906 film
lays out the problem：“Regardless of the fact that
there are a number of good motion pictures
brought out, it is true that there are some which,
although photographically good, are poor because
the manufacturer, being familiar with the picture
and the plot, does not take into consideration that
the film was not made for him but for the audience.
A movie recently seen was very good
photographically, but the story could not be
understood by the audience.” In a few theaters, a
lecturer might explain the plot as the film unrolled,
but producers could not rely on such aids.
Filmmakers came to assume that a film should
guide the spectator’s attention, making every
aspect of the story on the screen as clear as
possible. In particular, films increasingly set up a
chain of narrative causes and effects. One event
would plainly lead to an effect, which would in turn
cause another effect, and so on. Moreover, an
event was typically caused by a character’s beliefs
or desires. Character psychology had not been
particularly important in early films. Comical chases
or brief melodramas depended more on physical
action or familiar situations than on character traits.
Increasingly after 1907, however, character
psychology motivated actions. By following a series
of characters' goals and resulting conflicts, the
spectator could comprehend the action.
Every aspect of the silent-film style came to be
used to enhance narrative clarity. Staging or
framing action in depth could show the spatial
relationships among elements. Intertitles could add
narrative information beyond what the images
conveyed. Closer views of the actors could suggest
their emotions more precisely. Color, set design,
and lighting could imply time of day, the milieu of
the action, and so on.
Some of the most important innovations of this
period involved the ways in which camera shots
were put together, or edited, to create a story In
one sense, editing was a boon to the filmmaker,
permitting instant movement from one space to
another or cuts to closer views to reveal details. But
if the spectator could not keep track of the temporal
or spatial relations between one shot and the next,
editing might also lead to confusion. In some
cases, intertitles could help. Editing also came to
emphasize continuity among shots. Certain visual
cues indicated that time was flowing
uninterruptedly across cuts. Between scenes, other
cues might suggest how much time had been
skipped over. When a cut moved from one space to
another, the director found ways to orient the
viewer.

66 – 1 The Actor and the Audience
Actors, even when they are well rehearsed, can
never fully anticipate how well they will perform
before an actual audience. The actor who has been
brilliant in rehearsal can crumble before an
audience and completely lose the "edge" of his or
her performance in the face of stage fright and
apprehension. The presence of an audience can
affect performance in other ways as well. Or-and
this is more likely-an actor who seemed fairly
unexciting at rehearsal can suddenly take fire and
dazzle the audience with unexpected energy,
subtlety, and depth. One celebrated example of
this phenomenon was achieved by Lee J Cobb in
the original production of Arthur Miller's Death of a
Salesman, in which Cobb had the title role. The
presence of an audience can affect performance in
other ways as well. Roles rehearsed in all
solemnity can suddenly turn comical in
performance; conversely, roles developed for
comic potential in rehearsal may be received
soberly by an audience and lose their comedic
aspect entirely.
Sudden and dramatic change, however, is not the
norm as the performance phase replaces
rehearsal: most actors cross over from final dress
rehearsal to opening night with only the slightest
shift: indeed, this is generally thought to be the goal
of a disciplined and professional rehearsal
schedule. Holding back until opening night, the
once-popular acting practice of restraining
emotional display until opening night, is universally
disavowed today, and opening night recklessness
is viewed as a sure sign of the amateur, who relies
primarily on guts and adrenaline to get through the
performance. Deliberate revision of a role in
performance, in response to the first waves of
laughter or applause, is similarly frowned upon in
all but the most inartistic of theaters today.
Nevertheless, a fundamental shift does occur in the
actor's awareness between rehearsal and
performance, and this cannot and should not be
denied: indeed, it is essential to the creation of
theater art. This shift is set up by an elementary
feedback: the actor is inevitably aware, with at least
a portion of his or her mind, of the audience's
reaction to his or her own performance and that of
the other players; there is always, in any acting
performance, a subtle adjustment to the audience
that sees it. The outward manifestations of this
adjustment are usually all but imperceptible: the
split-second hold for a laugh to die down, the slight
special projection of a certain line to make sure that
it reaches the back row, the quick turn of a head to
make a characterization or plot transition extra
clear.
In addition, the best actors consistently radiate a
quality known to the theater world as presence. It is
a quality difficult to describe, but it has the effect of
making both the character whom the actor portrays
and the self of the actor who represents that
character especially vibrant and in the present for
the audience: it is the quality of an actor who takes
the stage and acknowledges, in some inexplicable
yet indelible manner, that he or she is there to be
seen. Performance is not a one-way statement
given from the stage to the house; it is a two-way
participatory communication between the actors
and the audience members in which the former
employ text and movement and the latter employ
applause, laughter, silence, and attention.
Even when the audience is silent and invisible-and,
owing to the brightness of the stage lights, the
audience is frequently invisible to the actor-the
performer feels its presence. There is nothing
extrasensory about this: the absence of sound is
itself a signal, for when several hundred people sit
without shuffling, coughing, or muttering, their
silence betokens a level of attention for which the
actor customarily strives. Laughter, gasps, sighs,
and applause similarly feed back into the actor's
consciousness-and unconsciousness-and spur (or
sometimes, alas, distract) the actor's efforts. The
veteran actor can determine quickly how to ride the
crest of audience laughter and how to hold the line
just long enough that it will pierce the lingering
chuckles but not be overridden by them, he or she
also knows how to vary the pace and/or redouble
his or her energy when sensing restlessness or
boredom on the other side of the curtain line.
Performance technique, or the art of reading an
audience, is more instinctual than learned. The
timing it requires is of such complexity that no actor
could master it rationally; he or she can develop it
only out of experience.

ART / ARCHITECTURE / CULTURE /
ART HISTORY / ARCHEOLOGY /
SCULPTURE / VISUAL ARTS
03 – 1 Architecture
Architecture is the art and science of designing
structures that organize and enclose space for
practical and symbolic purposes. Because
architecture grows out of human needs and
aspirations, it clearly communicates cultural values.
Of all the visual arts, architecture affects our lives
most directly for it determines the character of the
human environment in major ways.
Architecture is a three-dimensional form. It utilizes
space, mass, texture, line, light, and color. To be
architecture, a building must achieve a working
harmony with a variety of elements. Humans
instinctively seek structures that will shelter and
enhance their way of life. It is the work of architects
to create buildings that are not simply constructions
but also offer inspiration and delight. Buildings
contribute to human life when they provide shelter,
enrich space, complement their site, suit the
climate, and are economically feasible. The client
who pays for the building and defines its function is
an important member of the architectural team. The
mediocre design of many contemporary buildings
can be traced to both clients and architects.
In order for the structure to achieve the size and
strength necessary to meet its purpose,
architecture employs methods of support that,
because they are based on physical laws, have
changed little since people first discovered themeven while building materials have changed
dramatically. The world's architectural structures
have also been devised in relation to the objective
limitations of materials. Structures can be analyzed
in terms of how they deal with downward forces
created by gravity. They are designed to withstand
the forces of compression (pushing together),
tension (pulling apart), bending, or a combination of
these in different parts of the structure.
Even development in architecture has been the
result of major technological changes. Materials
and methods of construction are integral parts of
the design of architecture structures. In earlier
times it was necessary to design structural systems
suitable for the materials that were available, such
as wood, stone, brick. Today technology has
progressed to the point where it is possible to
invent new building materials to suit the type of
structure desired. Enormous changes in materials
and techniques of construction within the last few
generations have made it possible to enclose
space with much greater ease and speed and with
a minimum of material. Progress in this area can be
measured by the difference in weight between
buildings built now and those of comparable size
built one hundred years ago.
Modern architectural forms generally have three
separate components comparable to elements of
the human body: a supporting skeleton or frame,
an outer skin enclosing the interior spaces, and
equipment, similar to the body's vital organs and
systems. The equipment includes plumbing,
electrical wiring, hot water, and air-conditioning. Of
course in early architecture-such as igloos and
adobe structures-there was no such equipment,
and the skeleton and skin were often one.
Much of the world's great architecture has been
constructed of stone because of its beauty,
permanence, and availability. In the past, whole
cities grew from the arduous task of cutting and
piling stone upon. Some of the world's finest stone
architecture can be seen in the ruins of the ancient
Inca city of Machu Picchu high in the eastern
Andes Mountains of Peru. The doorways and
windows are made possible by placing over the
open spaces thick stone beams that support the
weight from above. A structural invention had to be
made before the physical limitations of stone could
be overcome and new architectural forms could be
created. That invention was the arch, a curved
structure originally made of separate stone or brick
segments. The arch was used by the early cultures
of the Mediterranean area chiefly for underground
drains, but it was the Romans who first developed
and used the arch extensively in aboveground
structures. Roman builders perfected the
semicircular arch made of separate blocks of stone.
As a method of spanning space, the arch can
support greater weight than a horizontal beam. It
works in compression to divert the weight above it
out to the sides, where the weight is borne by the
vertical elements on either side of the arch. The
arch is among the many important structural
breakthroughs that have characterized architecture
throughout the centuries.

04 – 2 Cave Art in Europe
The earliest discovered traces of art are beads and
carvings, and then paintings, from sites dating back
to the Upper Paleolithic period. We might expect
that early artistic efforts would be crude, but the
cave paintings of Spain and southern France show
a marked degree of skill. So do the naturalistic
paintings on slabs of stone excavated in southern
Africa. Some of those slabs appear to have been
painted as much as 28,000 years ago, which
suggests that painting in Africa is as old as painting
in Europe. But painting may be even older than
that. The early Australians may have painted on
the walls of rock shelters and cliff faces at least
30,000 years ago, and maybe as much as 60,000
years ago.
The researchers Peter Ucko and Andree Rosenfeld
identified three principal locations of paintings in
the caves of western Europe : (1) in obviously
inhabited rock shelters and cave entrances; (2) in
galleries immediately off the inhabited areas of
caves; and (3) in the inner reaches of caves,
whose difficulty of access has been interpreted by
some as a sign that magical-religious activities
were performed there.
The subjects of the paintings are mostly animals.
The paintings rest on bare walls, with no backdrops
or environmental trappings. Perhaps, like many
contemporary peoples, Upper Paleolithic men and
women believed that the drawing of a human
image could cause death or injury, and if that were
indeed their belief, it might explain why human
figures are rarely depicted in cave art. Another
explanation for the focus on animals might be that
these people sought to improve their luck at
hunting. This theory is suggested by evidence of
chips in the painted figures, perhaps made by
spears thrown at the drawings. But if improving
their hunting luck was the chief motivation for the
paintings, it is difficult to explain why only a few
show signs of having been speared. Perhaps the
paintings were inspired by the need to increase the
supply of animals. Cave art seems to have reached
a peak toward the end of the Upper Paleolithic
period, when the herds of game were decreasing.
The particular symbolic significance of the cave
paintings in southwestern France is more explicitly
revealed, perhaps, by the results of a study
conducted by researchers Patricia Rice and Ann
Paterson. The data they present suggest that the
animals portrayed in the cave paintings were
mostly the ones that the painters preferred for meat
and for materials such as hides. For example, wild
cattle (bovines) and horses are portrayed more
often than we would expect by chance, probably
because they were larger and heavier (meatier)
than other animals in the environment. In addition,
the paintings mostly portray animals that the
painters may have feared the most because of their
size, speed, natural weapons such as tusks and
horns, and the unpredictability of their behavior.
That is, mammoths, bovines, and horses are
portrayed more often than deer and reindeer. Thus,
the paintings are consistent with the idea that the
art is related to the importance of hunting in the
economy of Upper Paleolithic people. Consistent
with this idea, according to the investigators, is the
fact that the art of the cultural period that followed
the Upper Paleolithic also seems to reflect how
people got their food. But in that period, when
getting food no longer depended on hunting large
game animals (because they were becoming
extinct), the art ceased to focus on portrayals of
animals.
Upper Paleolithic art was not confined to cave
paintings. Many shafts of spears and similar
objects were decorated with figures of animals. The
anthropologist Alexander Marshack has an
interesting interpretation of some of the engravings
made during the Upper Paleolithic. He believes that
as far back as 30,000 B.C., hunters may have used
a system of notation, engraved on bone and stone,
to mark phases of the Moon. If this is true, it would
mean that Upper Paleolithic people were capable
of complex thought and were consciously aware of
their environment. In addition to other artworks,
figurines representing the human female in
exaggerated form have also been found at Upper
Paleolithic sites. It has been suggested that these
figurines were an ideal type or an expression of a
desire for fertility.

10 – 1 Chinese Pottery
China has one of the world's oldest continuous
civilizations—despite invasions and occasional
foreign rule. A country as vast as China with so
long-lasting a civilization has a complex social and
visual history, within which pottery and porcelain
play a major role.
The function and status of ceramics in China varied
from dynasty to dynasty, so they may be utilitarian,
burial, trade-collectors', or even ritual objects,
according to their quality and the era in which they
were made. The ceramics fall into three broad
types-earthenware, stoneware, and porcelain-for
vessels, architectural items such as roof tiles, and
modeled objects and figures. In addition, there was
an important group of sculptures made for religious
use, the majority of which were produced in
earthenware.
The earliest ceramics were fired to earthenware
temperatures, but as early as the fifteenth century
B.C., high-temperature stonewares were being
made with glazed surfaces. During the Six
Dynasties period (A.D. 265-589), kilns in north
China were producing high-fired ceramics of good
quality. Whitewares produced in Hebei and Henan
provinces from the seventh to the tenth centuries
evolved into the highly prized porcelains of the
Song dynasty (A.D. 960-1279), long regarded as
one of the high points in the history of China's
ceramic industry. The tradition of religious sculpture
extends over most historical periods but is less
clearly delineated than that of stonewares or
porcelains, for it embraces the old custom of
earthenware burial ceramics with later religious
images and architectural ornament. Ceramic
products also include lead-glazed tomb models of
the Han dynasty, three-color lead-glazed vessels
and figures of the Tang dynasty, and Ming threecolor temple ornaments, in which the motifs were
outlined in a raised trail of slip-as well as the many
burial ceramics produced in imitation of vessels
made in materials of higher intrinsic value.
Trade between the West and the settled and
prosperous Chinese dynasties introduced new
forms and different technologies. One of the most
far-reaching examples is the impact of the fine
ninth-century A.D.. Chinese porcelain wares
imported into the Arab world. So admired were
these pieces that they encouraged the
development of earthenware made in imitation of
porcelain and instigated research into the method
of their manufacture. From the Middle East the
Chinese acquired a blue pigment-a purified form of
cobalt oxide unobtainable at that time in China-that
contained only a low level of manganese. Cobalt
ores found in China have a high manganese
content, which produces a more muted blue-gray
color. In the seventeenth century, the trading
activities of the Dutch East India Company resulted
in vast quantities of decorated Chinese porcelain
being brought to Europe, which stimulated and
influenced the work of a wide variety of wares,
notably Delft. The Chinese themselves adapted
many specific vessel forms from the West, such as
bottles with long spouts, and designed a range of
decorative patterns especially for the European
market.
Just as painted designs on Greek pots may seem
today to be purely decorative, whereas in fact they
were carefully and precisely worked out so that at
the time, their meaning was clear, so it is with
Chinese pots. To twentieth-century eyes, Chinese
pottery may appear merely decorative, yet to the
Chinese the form of each object and its adornment
had meaning and significance. The dragon
represented the emperor, and the phoenix, the
empress; the pomegranate indicated fertility, and a
pair of fish, happiness; mandarin ducks stood for
wedded bliss; the pine tree, peach, and crane are
emblems of long life; and fish leaping from waves
indicated success in the civil service examinations.
Only when European decorative themes were
introduced did these meanings become obscured
or even lost.
From early times pots were used in both religious
and secular contexts. The imperial court
commissioned work and in the Yuan dynasty (A.D.
1279-1368) an imperial ceramic factory was
established at Jingdezhen. Pots played an
important part in some religious ceremonies. Long
and often lyrical descriptions of the different types
of ware exist that assist in classifying pots,
although these sometimes confuse an already
large and complicated picture.

11 – 1 Ancient Egyptian Sculpture
In order to understand ancient Egyptian art, it is
vital to know as much as possible of the elite
Egyptians’ view of the world and the functions and
contexts of the art produced for them. Without this
knowledge we can appreciate only the formal
content of Egyptian art, and we will fail to
understand why it was produced or the concepts
that shaped it and caused it to adopt its distinctive
forms. In fact, a lack of understanding concerning
the purposes of Egyptian art has often led it to be
compared unfavorably with the art of other cultures:
Why did the Egyptians not develop sculpture in
which the body turned and twisted through space
like classical Greek statuary? Why do the artists
seem to get left and right confused? And why did
they not discover the geometric perspective as
European artists did in the Renaissance? The
answer to such questions has nothing to do with a
lack of skill or imagination on the part of Egyptian
artists and everything to do with the purposes for
which they were producing their art.
The majority of three-dimensional representations,
whether standing, seated, or kneeling, exhibit what
is called frontality: they face straight ahead, neither
twisting nor turning. When such statues are viewed
in isolation, out of their original context and without
knowledge of their function, it is easy to criticize
them for their rigid attitudes that remained
unchanged for three thousand years. Frontality is,
however, directly related to the functions of
Egyptian statuary and the contexts in which the
statues were set up. Statues were created not for
their decorative effect but to play a primary role in
the cults of the gods, the king, and the dead. They
were designed to be put in places where these
beings could manifest themselves in order to be
the recipients of ritual actions. Thus it made sense
to show the statue looking ahead at what was
happening in front of it, so that the living performer
of the ritual could interact with the divine or
deceased recipient. Very often such statues were
enclosed in rectangular shrines or wall niches
whose only opening was at the front, making it
natural for the statue to display frontality. Other
statues were designed to be placed within an
architectural setting, for instance, in front of the
monumental entrance gateways to temples known
as pylons, or in pillared courts, where they would
be placed against or between pillars: their frontality
worked perfectly within the architectural context.
Statues were normally made of stone, wood, or
metal. Stone statues were worked from single
rectangular blocks of material and retained the
compactness of the original shape. The stone
between the arms and the body and between the
legs in standing figures or the legs and the seat in
seated ones was not normally cut away. From a
practical aspect this protected the figures against
breakage and psychologically gives the images a
sense of strength and power, usually enhanced by
a supporting back pillar. By contrast, wooden
statues were carved from several pieces of wood
that were pegged together to form the finished
work, and metal statues were either made by
wrapping sheet metal around a wooden core or
cast by the lost wax process. The arms could be
held away from the body and carry separate items
in their hands; there is no back pillar. The effect is
altogether lighter and freer than that achieved in
stone, but because both perform the same
function, formal wooden and metal statues still
display frontality.
Apart from statues representing deities, kings, and
named members of the elite that can be called
formal, there is another group of three-dimensional
representations that depicts generic figures,
frequently servants, from the nonelitepopulation.
The function of these is quite different. Many are
made to be put in the tombs of the elite in order to
serve the tomb owners in the afterlife. Unlike formal
statues that are limited to static poses of standing,
sitting, and kneeling, these figures depict a wide
range of actions, such as grinding grain, baking
bread, producing pots, and making music, and they
are shown in appropriate poses, bending and
squatting as they carry out their tasks.

23 – 3 Rock Art of the Australia Aborigines
Ever since European first explored Australia,
people have been trying to understand the ancient
rock drawings and carvings created by the
Aborigines, the original inhabitants of the continent.
Early in the nineteenth century, encounters with
Aboriginal rock art tended to be infrequent and
open to speculative interpretation, but since the
late nineteenth century, awareness of the extent
and variety of Australian rock art has been growing.
In the latter decades of the twentieth century there
were intensified efforts to understand and record
the abundance of Australian rock art.
The systematic study of this art is a relatively new
discipline in Australia. Over the past four decades
new discoveries have steadily added to the body of
knowledge. The most significant data have come
from a concentration on three major questions.
First, what is the age of Australian rock art?
Second, what is its stylistic organization and is it
possible to discern a sequence or a pattern of
development between styles? Third, is it possible to
interpret accurately the subject matter of ancient
rock art, bringing to bear all available
archaeological techniques and the knowledge of
present-day Aboriginal informants?
The age of Australia’s rock art is constantly being
revised, and earlier datings have been proposed as
the result of new discoveries. Currently, reliable
scientific evidence dates the earliest creation of art
on rock surfaces in Australia to somewhere
between 30,000 and 50,000 years ago. This in
itself is an almost incomprehensible span of
generations, and one that makes Australia’s rock
art the oldest continuous art tradition in the world.
Although the remarkable antiquity of Australia’s
rock art is now established, the sequences and
meanings of its images have been widely debated.
Since the mid-1970s, a reasonably stable picture
has been formed of the organization of Australian
rock art. In order to create a sense of structure to
this picture, researchers have relied on a distinction
that still underlies the forms of much indigenous
visual culture — a distinction between geometric
and figurative elements. Simple geometric
repeated patterns — circles, concentric circles, and
lines — constitute the iconography (characteristic
images) of the earliest rock-art sites found across
Australia. The frequency with which certain simple
motifs appear in these oldest sites has led rock-art
researchers to adopt a descriptive term — the
Panaramitee style — a label which takes its name
from the extensive rock pavements at Panaramitee
North in desert South Australia, which are covered
with motifs pecked into the surface. Certain
features of these engravings lead to the conclusion
that they are of great age — geological changes
had clearly happened after the designs had been
made and local Aboriginal informants, when first
questioned about them, seemed to know nothing of
their origins. Furthermore, the designs were
covered with “desert varnish”, a glaze that develops
on rock surfaces over thousands of years of
exposure to the elements. The simple motifs found
at Panaramitee are common to many rock-art sites
across Australia. Indeed, sites with engravings of
geometric shapes are also to be found on the
island of Tasmania, which was separated from the
mainland of the continent some 10,000 years ago.
In the 1970s when the study of Australian
archaeology was in an exciting phase of
development, with the great antiquity of rock art
becoming clear,Lesley Maynard, the archaeologist
who coined the phrase “Panaramitee style”,
suggested that a sequence could be determined for
Australian rock art, in which a geometric style gave
way to a simple figurative style (outlines of figures
and animals), followed by a range of complex
figurative styles that, unlike the pan-Australian
geometric tradition, tended to much greater
regional diversity. While accepting that this
sequence fits the archaeological profile of those
sites, which were occupied continuously over many
thousands of years a number of writers have
warned that the underlying assumption of such a
sequence — a development from the simple and
the geometric to the complex and naturalistic —
obscures the cultural continuities in Aboriginal
Australia, in which geometric symbolism remains
fundamentally important. In this context the
simplicity of a geometric motif may be more
apparent than real. Motifs of seeming simplicity can
encode complex meanings in Aboriginal Australia.
And has not twentieth-century art shown that
naturalism does not necessarily follow abstraction
in some kind of predetermined sequence?
156
24 – 3 Moving into Pueblos
In the Mesa Verde area of the ancient North
American Southwest, living patterns changed in the
thirteenth century, with large numbers of people
moving into large communal dwellings called
pueblos, often constructed at the edges of
canyons, especially on the sides of cliffs.
Abandoning small extended-family households to
move into these large pueblos with dozens if not
hundreds of other people was probably traumatic.
Few of the cultural traditions and rules that today
allow us to deal with dense populations existed for
these people accustomed to household autonomy
and the ability to move around the landscape
almost at will. And besides the awkwardness of
having to share walls with neighbors, living in
aggregated pueblos introduced other problems. For
people in cliff dwellings, hauling water, wood, and
food to their homes was a major chore. The stress
on local resources, especially in the firewood
needed for daily cooking and warmth, was
particularly intense, and conditions in aggregated
pueblos were not very hygienic.
Given all the disadvantages of living in aggregated
towns, why did people in the thirteenth century
move into these closely packed quarters? For
transitions of such suddenness, archaeologists
consider either pull factors (benefits that drew
families together) or push factors (some external
threat or crisis that forced people to aggregate). In
this case, push explanations dominate.
Population growth is considered a particularly
influential push. After several generations of
population growth, people packed the landscape in
densities so high that communal pueblos may have
been a necessary outcome. Around Sand Canyon,
for example, populations grew from 5 -12 people
per square kilometer in the tenth century to as
many as 30 - 50 by the 1200s. As densities
increased, domestic architecture became larger,
culminating in crowded pueblos. Some scholars
expand on this idea by emphasizing a
corresponding need for arable land to feed growing
numbers of people: construction of small dams,
reservoirs, terraces, and field houses indicates that
farmers were intensifying their efforts during the
1200s. Competition for good farmland may also
have prompted people to bond together to assert
rights over the best fields.
Another important push was the onset of the Little
Ice Age, a climatic phenomenon that led to cooler
temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere.
Although the height of the Little Ice Age was still
around the corner, some evidence suggests that
temperatures were falling during the thirteenth
century. The environmental changes associated
with this transition are not fully understood, but
people living closest to the San Juan Mountains, to
the northeast of Mesa Verde, were affected first.
Growing food at these elevations is always difficult
because of the short growing season. As the Little
Ice Age progressed, farmers probably moved their
fields to lower elevations, infringing on the lands of
other farmers and pushing people together, thus
contributing to the aggregations. Archaeologists
identify a corresponding shift in populations toward
the south and west toward Mesa Verde and away
from higher elevations.
In the face of all these pushes, people in the Mesa
Verde area had yet another reason to move into
communal villages: the need for greater
cooperation. Sharing and cooperation were almost
certainly part of early Puebloan life, even for people
living in largely independent single-household
residences scattered across the landscape.
Archaeologists find that even the most isolated
residences during the eleventh and twelfth
centuries obtained some pottery, and probably
food, from some distance away, while major
ceremonial events were opportunities for sharing
food and crafts. Scholars believe that this
cooperation allowed people to contend with a
patchy environment in which precipitation and other
resources varied across the landscape: if you
produce a lot of food one year, you might trade it
for pottery made by a distant ally who is having
difficulty with crops — and the next year, the flow of
goods might go in the opposite direction. But all of
this appears to have changed thirteenth century.
Although the climate remained as unpredictable as
ever between one year and the next, it became
much less locally diverse. In a bad year for farming,
everyone was equally affected. No longer was it
helpful to share widely. Instead, the most sensible
thing would be for neighbors to combine efforts to
produce as much food as possible, and thus
aggregated towns were a sensible arrangement.

27 – 1 Crafts in the Ancient Near East
Some of the earliest human civilizations arose in
southern Mesopotamia, in what is now southern
Iraq, in the fourth millennium B.C.E. In the second
half of the millennium, in the south around the city
of Uruk, there was an enormous escalation in the
area occupied by permanent settlements. A large
part of that increase took place in Uruk itself, which
became a real urban center surrounded by a set of
secondary settlements. While population estimates
are notoriously unreliable, scholars assume that
Uruk inhabitants were able to support themselves
from the agricultural production of the field
surrounding the city, which could be reached with a
daily commute. But Uruk's dominant size in the
entire region, far surpassing that of other
settlements, indicates that it was a regional center
and a true city. Indeed, it was the first city in human
history.
The vast majority of its population remained active
in agriculture, even those people living within the
city itself. But a small segment of the urban society
started to specialize in nonagricultural tasks as a
result of the city's role as a regional center. Within
the productive sector, there was a growth of a
variety of specialist craftspeople. Early in the Uruk
period, the use of undecorated utilitarian pottery
was probably the result of specialized mass
production. In an early fourth-millennium level of
the Eanna archaeological site at Uruk, a pottery
style appears that is most characteristic of this
process, the so-called beveled-rim bowl. It is a
rather shallow bowl that was crudely made in a
mold; hence, in only a limited number of standard
sizes. For some unknown reason, many were
discarded, often still intact, and thousands have
been found all over the Near East. The beveled-rim
bowl is one of the most telling diagnostic finds for
identifying an Uruk-period site. Of importance is the
fact that it was produced rapidly in large amounts,
most likely by specialists in a central location.
A variety of documentation indicates that certain
goods, once made by a family member as one of
many duties, were later made by skilled artisans.
Certain images depict groups of people, most likely
women, involved in weaving textiles, an activity we
know from later third-millennium texts to have been
vital in the economy and to have been centrally
administered. Also, a specialized metal-producing
workshop may have been excavated in a small
area at Uruk. It contained a number of channels
lined by a sequence of holes, about 50 centimeters
deep, all showing burn marks and filled with ashes.
This has been interpreted as the remains of a
workshop where molten metal was scooped up
from the channel and poured into molds in the
holes. Some type of mass production by specialists
were involved here.
Objects themselves suggest that they were the
work of skilled professionals. In the late Uruk period
(3500-3100 B.C.E.), there first appeared a type of
object that remained characteristic for
Mesopotamia throughout its entire history: the
cylinder seal. This was a small cylinder, usually no
more than 3 centimeters high and 2 centimeters in
diameter, of shell, bone, faience (a glassy type of
stoneware), or various types of stones, on which a
scene was carved into the surface. When rolled
over a soft material - primarily the clay of bullae
(round seals), tablets, or clay lumps attached to
boxes, jars, or door bolts - the scene would appear
in relief, easily legible. The technological
knowledge needed to carve it was far superior to
that for stamp seals, which had happened in the
early Neolithic period (approximately 10,000-5000
B.C.E.). From the first appearance of cylinder
seals, the carved scenes could be highly elaborate
and refined, indicating the work of specialist stonecutters. Similarly, the late Uruk period shows the
first monumental art, relief, and statuary in the
round, made with a degree of mastery that only a
professional could have produced.

29 – 1 Characteristics of Roman Pottery
The pottery of ancient Romans is remarkable in
several ways. The high quality of Roman pottery is
very easy to appreciate when handling actual
pieces of tableware or indeed kitchenware and
amphorae (the large jars used throughout the
Mediterranean for the transport and storage of
liquids, such as wine and oil). However, it is
impossible to do justice to Roman wares on the
page, even when words can be backed up by
photographs and drawing. Most Roman pottery is
light and smooth to touch and very tough, although,
like all pottery, it shatters if dropped on a hard
surface. It is generally made with carefully selected
and purified clay, worked to thin-walled and
standardized shapes on a fast wheel and fired in a
kiln (pottery oven) capable of ensuring a consistent
finish. With handmade pottery, inevitably there are
slight differences between individual vessels of the
same design and occasional minor blemishes
(flaws). But what strikes the eye and the touch
most immediately and most powerfully with Roman
pottery is its consistent high quality.
This is not just an aesthetic consideration but also
a practical one. These vessels are solid (brittle, but
not fragile), they are pleasant and easy to handle
(being light and smooth), and, with their hard and
sometimes glossy (smooth and shiny) surfaces,
they hold liquids well and are easy to wash.
Furthermore, their regular and standardized
shapes would have made them simple to stack and
store. When people today are shown a very
ordinary Roman pot and, in particular, are allowed
to handle it, they often comment on how modern it
looks and feels, and they need to be convinced of
its true age.
As impressive as the quality of Roman pottery is its
sheer massive quantity. When considering
quantities, we would ideally like to have some
estimates for overall production from particular
sites of pottery manufacture and for overall
consumption at specific settlements. Unfortunately,
it is in the nature of the archaeological evidence,
which is almost invariable only a sample of what
once existed, that such figures will always be
elusive. However, no one who has ever worked in
the field would question the abundance of Roman
pottery, particularly in the Mediterranean region.
This abundance is notable in Roman settlements
(especially urban sites) where the labor that
archaeologists have to put into the washing and
sorting of potsherds (fragments of pottery)
constitutes a high proportion of the total work
during the initial phases of excavation.
Only rarely can we derive any "real" quantities from
deposits of broken pots. However, there is one
exceptional dump, which does represent a very
large part of the site's total history of consumption
and for which an estimate of quantity has been
produced. On the left bank of the Tiber River in
Rome, by one of the river ports of the ancient city,
is a substantial hill some 50 meters high called
Monte Testaccio. It is made up entirely of broken oil
amphorae, mainly of the second and third centuries
A.D. It has been estimated that Monte Testaccio
contains the remains of some 53 million amphorae,
in which around 6,000 million liters of oil were
imported into the city from overseas. Imports into
imperial Rome were supported by the full might of
the state and were therefore quite exceptional - but
the size of the operations at Monte Testaccio, and
the productivity and complexity that lay behind
them, nonetheless cannot fail to impress. This was
a society with similarities to modern one - moving
goods on a gigantic scale, manufacturing highquality containers to do so, and occasionally, as
here, even discarding them on delivery.
Roman pottery was transported not only in large
quantities but also over substantial distances.
Many Roman pots, in particular amphorae and the
fine wares designed for use at tables, could travel
hundreds of miles - all over the Mediterranean and
also further afield. But maps that show the various
spots where Roman pottery of a particular type has
been found tell only part of the story. What is more
significant than any geographical spread is the
access that different levels of society had to goodquality products. In all but the remotest regions of
the empire, Roman pottery of a high standard is
common at the sites of humble villages and
isolated farmsteads.

34 – 1 Islamic Art and the Book
The arts of the Islamic book, such as calligraphy
and decorative drawing, developed during A.D. 900
to 1500, and luxury books are some of the most
characteristic examples of Islamic art produced in
this period. This came about from two major
developments: paper became common, replacing
parchment as the major medium for writing, and
rounded scripts were regularized and perfected so
that they replaced the angular scripts of the
previous period, which because of their angularity
were uneven in height. Books became major
vehicles for artistic expression, and the artists who
produced them, notably calligraphers and painters,
enjoyed high status, and their workshops were
often sponsored by princes and their courts. Before
A.D. 900, manuscripts of the Koran (the book
containing the teachings of the Islamic religion)
seem to have been the most common type of book
produced and decorated, but after that date a wide
range of books were produced for a broad
spectrum of patrons. These continued to include, of
course, manuscripts of the Koran, which every
Muslim wanted to read, but scientific works,
histories, romances, and epic and lyric poetry were
also copied in fine handwriting and decorated with
beautiful illustrations. Most were made for sale on
the open market, and cities boasted special souks
(markets) where books were bought and sold. The
mosque of Marrakech in Morocco is known as the
Kutubiyya, or Booksellers’ Mosque, after the
adjacent market. Some of the most luxurious books
were specific commissions made at the order of a
particular prince and signed by the calligrapher and
decorator.
Papermaking had been introduced to the Islamic
lands from China in the eighth century. It has been
said that Chinese papermakers were among the
prisoners captured in a battle fought near
Samarqand between the Chinese and the Muslims
in 751, and the technique of papermaking—in
which cellulose pulp extracted from any of several
plants is first suspended in water, caught on a fine
screen, and then dried into flexible sheets—slowly
spread westward. Within fifty years, the
government in Baghdad was using paper for
documents. Writing in ink on paper, unlike
parchment, could not easily be erased, and
therefore paper had the advantage that it was
difficult to alter what was written on it. Papermaking
spread quickly to Egypt—and eventually to Sicily
and Spain—but it was several centuries before
paper supplanted parchment for copies of the
Koran, probably because of the conservative
nature of religious art and its practitioners. In
western Islamic lands, parchment continued to be
used for manuscripts of the Koran throughout this
period.
The introduction of paper spurred a conceptual
revolution whose consequences have barely been
explored. Although paper was never as cheap as it
has become today, it was far less expensive than
parchment, and therefore more people could afford
to buy books, Paper is thinner than parchment, so
more pages could be enclosed within a single
volume. At first, paper was made in relatively small
sheets that were pasted together, but by the
beginning of the fourteenth century, very large
sheets—as much as a meter across —were
available. These large sheets meant that
calligraphers and artists had more space on which
to work. Paintings became more complicated,
giving the artist greater opportunities to depict
space or emotion. The increased availability of
paper, particularly after 1250, encouraged people
to develop systems of representation, such as
architectural plans and drawings. This in turn
allowed the easy transfer of artistic ideas and
motifs over great distances from one medium to
another, and in a different scale in ways that had
been difficult, if not impossible, in the previous
period.
Rounded styles of Arabic handwriting had long
been used for correspondence and documents
alongside the formal angular scripts used for
inscriptions and manuscripts of the Koran. Around
the year 900, Ibn Muqla, who was a secretary and
vizier at the Abbasid court in Baghdad, developed
a system of proportioned writing. He standardized
the length of alif, the first letter of the Arabic
alphabet, and then determined what the size and
shape of all other letters should be, based on the
alif. Eventually, six round forms of handwriting,
composed of three pairs of big and little scripts
known collectively as the Six Pens, became the
standard repertory of every calligrapher.

37 – 3 Modern Architecture in the United States
At the end of the nineteenth century, there were
basically two kinds of buildings in the United
States. On one hand were the buildings produced
for the wealthy or for civic purposes, which tended
to echo the architecture of the past and to use
traditional styles of ornamentation. On the other
hand were purely utilitarian structures, such as
factories and grain elevators, which employed
modern materials such as steel girders and plate
glass in an undisguised and unadorned manner.
Such buildings, however, were viewed in a
category separate from "fine" architecture, and in
fact were often designed by engineers and builders
rather than architects. The development of modern
architecture might in large part be seen as an
adaptation of this sort of functional building and its
pervasive application for daily use. Indeed, in this
influential book Toward a New Architecture, the
Swiss architect Le Corbusier illustrated his text with
photographs of American factories and grain
storage silos, as well as ships, airplanes, and other
industrial objects. Nonetheless, modern architects
did not simply employ these new materials in a
strictly practical fashion—they consciously
exploited their aesthetic possibilities. For example,
glass could be used to open up walls and eliminate
their stone and brick masonry because large
spaces could now be spanned with steel beams.
The fundamental premise of modern architecture
was that the appearance of the building should
exhibit the nature of its materials and forms of
physical support. This often led to effects that
looked odd from a traditional standpoint but that
became hallmarks of modern architecture for
precisely this reason. For example, in traditional
architecture, stone or brick walls served a structural
role, but in a steel-beam building the walls were
essentially hung from the internal skeleton of steel
beams, which meant that walls and corners no
longer needed to be solid but could be opened up
in unexpected ways. At the Fagus shoe factory in
Germany, for example, German architect Walter
Gropius placed glass walls in the corners,
effectively breaking open the box of traditional
architecture and creating a new sense of light and
openness. Similarly, steel beams could be used to
construct balconies that projected out from the
building without any support beneath them. These
dramatic balconies quickly became a signature of
modern architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright.
Wright's most dramatic residence, Fallingwater,
has balconies that thrust far out over a stream in a
way that seems to defy gravity.
The ways in which new technology transformed
architectural design are dramatically illustrated
through the evolution of the high-rise office
building. After ten or twelve stories, masonry
construction reaches a maximum possible height,
since it runs into difficulties of compression and of
inadequate lateral strength to combat wind shear.
Steel construction, on the other hand, can support
a building of 50 or 100 stories without difficulty.
Such buildings were so different from any previous
form of architecture that they quickly acquired a
new name—the skyscraper.
From the standpoint of real estate developers, the
purpose of skyscrapers was to increase rental
space in valuable urban locations. But to create
usable high-rise buildings, a number of technical
challenges needed to be solved. One problem was
getting people to the upper floors, since after five or
six stories it becomes exhausting to climb stairs.
Updated and electrified versions of the freight
elevator that had been introduced by Elisha Graves
Otis in 1853 (several decades before skyscraper
construction) solved this problem. Another issue
was fire safety. The metal supporting buildings
became soft when exposed to fire and collapsed
relatively quickly. (They could melt at 2700
Fahrenheit, whereas major fires achieve
temperatures of 3000 degrees). However, when
the metal is encased in fire-retardant materials, its
vulnerability to fire is much decreased. In Chicago,
a system was developed for surrounding the metal
components with hollow tiles made from brick-like
terra-cotta. Such tiles are impervious to fire. The
terra-cotta tiles were used both to encase the
supporting members and as flooring. A structure
built with steel beams protected by terra-cotta tiles
was still three times lighter than a comparably sized
building that used masonry construction, so the
weight of the tiles was not a problem.

41 – 1 Navajo Art
The Navajo, a Native American people living in the
southwestern United States, live in small scattered
settlements. In many respects, such as education,
occupation, and leisure activities, their life is like
that of other groups that contribute to the diverse
social fabric of North American culture in the
twenty-first century. At the same time, they have
retained some traditional cultural practices that are
associated with particular art forms. For example,
the most important traditional Navajo rituals include
the production of large floor paintings. These are
actually made by pouring thin, finely controlled
streams of colored sands or pulverized vegetable
and mineral substances, pollen, and flowers in
precise patterns on the ground. The largest of
these paintings may be up to 5.5 meters in
diameter and cover the entire floor of a room.
Working from the inside of the design outward, the
Navajo artist and his assistants will sift the black,
white, bluish-gray, orange, and red materials
through their fingers to create the finely detailed
imagery. The paintings and chants used in the
ceremonies are directed by well-trained artists and
singers who enlist the aid of spirits who are
impersonated by masked performers. The twentyfour known Navajo chants can be represented by
up to 500 sand paintings. These complex paintings
serve as memory aids to guide the singers during
the performance of the ritual songs, which can last
up to nine days.
The purpose and meaning of the sand paintings
can be explained by examining one of the most
basic ideals of Navajo society, embodied in their
word hozho (beauty or harmony, goodness, and
happiness). It coexists with hochxo ("ugliness," or
"evil," and "disorder") in a world where opposing
forces of dynamism and stability create constant
change. When the world, which was created in
beauty, becomes ugly and disorderly, the Navajo
gather to perform rituals with songs and make sand
paintings to restore beauty and harmony to the
world. Some illness is itself regarded as a type of
disharmony. Thus, the restoration of harmony
through a ceremony can be part of a curing
process.
Men make sand paintings that are accurate copies
of paintings from the past. The songs sung over the
paintings are also faithful renditions of songs from
the past. By re¬creating these arts, which reflect
the original beauty of creation, the Navajo bring
beauty to the present world. As relative newcomers
to the Southwest, a place where their climate,
neighbors, and rulers could be equally inhospitable,
the Navajo created these art forms to affect the
world around them, not just through the recounting
of the actions symbolized, but through the beauty
and harmony of the artworks themselves. The
paintings generally illustrate ideas and events from
the life of a mythical hero, who, after being healed
by the gods, gave gifts of songs and paintings.
Working from memory, the artists re-create the
traditional form of the image as accurately as
possible.
The Navajo are also world-famous for the designs
on their woven blankets. Navajo women own the
family flocks, control the shearing of the sheep, the
carding, the spinning, and dying of the thread, and
the weaving of the fabrics. While the men who
make faithful copies of sand paintings from the past
represent the principle of stability in Navajo
thought, women embody dynamism and create
new designs for every weaving they make.
Weaving is a paradigm of the creativity of a mythic
ancestor named Spider Woman who wove the
universe as a cosmic web that united earth and
sky. It was she who，according to legend, taught
Navajo women how to weave. As they prepare their
materials and weave. Navajo women imitate the
transformations that originally created the world.
Working on their looms, Navajo weavers create
images through which they experience harmony
with nature. It is their means of creating beauty and
thereby contributing to the beauty, harmony, and
healing of the world. Thus, weaving is a way of
seeing the world and being part of it.

47 – 1 Roman Cultural Influence on Britain
After the Roman Empire’s conquest of Britain in the
first century A.D., the presence of administrators,
merchants, and troops on British soil, along with
the natural flow of ideas and goods from the rest of
the empire, had an enormous influence on life in
the British Isles. Cultural influences were of three
types: the bringing of objects, the transfer of craft
workers, and the introduction of massive civil
architecture. Many objects were not art in even the
broadest sense and comprised utilitarian items of
clothing, utensils, and equipment. We should not
underestimate the social status associated with
such mundane possessions which had not
previously been available. The flooding of Britain
with red-gloss pottery from Gaul (modern-day
France), decorated with scenes from Classical
mythology, probably brought many into contact with
the styles and artistic concepts of the GrecoRoman world for the first time, whether or not the
symbolism was understood. Mass-produced goods
were accompanied by fewer more aesthetically
impressive objects such as statuettes. Such pieces
perhaps first came with officials for their own
religious worship; others were then acquired by
native leaders as diplomatic gifts or by purchase.
Once seen by the natives, such objects created a
fashion which rapidly spread through the province.
In the most extreme instances, natives literally
bought the whole package of Roman culture. The
Fishbourne villa, built in the third quarter of the first
century A.D., probably for the native client king
Cogidubnus, amply illustrates his Roman
pretensions. It was constructed in the latest Italian
style with imported marbles and stylish mosaics. It
was lavishly furnished with imported sculptures and
other Classical objects. A visitor from Rome would
have recognized its owner as a participant in the
contemporary culture of the empire, not at all
provincial in taste. Even if those from the traditional
families looked down on him, they would have
been unable to dismiss him as uncultured.
Although exceptional, this demonstrates how new
cultural symbols bound provincials to the identify of
the Roman world.
Such examples established a standard to be
copied. One result was an influx of craft worker,
particularly those skilled in artistic media like stonecarving which had not existed before the conquest.
Civilian workers came mostly from Gaul and
Germany. The magnificent temple built beside the
sacred spring at Bath was constructed only about
twenty years after the conquest. Its detail shows
that it was carved by artists from northeast Gaul. In
the absence of a tradition of Classical stonecarving and building, the desire to develop Roman
amenities would have been difficult to fulfill.
Administrators thus used their personal contacts to
put the Britons in touch with architects and masons.
As many of the officials in Britain had strong links
with Gaul, it is not surprising that early Roman
Britain owes much to craft workers from that area.
Local workshops did develop and stylistically
similar groups of sculpture show how skills in this
new medium became widespread. Likewise skills in
the use of mosaic, wall painting, ceramic
decoration, and metal-working developed
throughout the province with the eventual
emergence of characteristically Romano-British
styles.
This art had a major impact on the native peoples,
and one of the most importance factors was a
change in the scale of buildings. Pre-Roman Britain
was highly localized, with people rarely traveling
beyond their own region. On occasion large groups
amassed for war or religious festivals, but society
remained centered on small communities.
Architecture of this era reflected this with even the
largest of the fortified towns and hill forts containing
no more than clusters of medium-sized structures.
The spaces inside even the largest roundhouses
were modest, and the use of rounded shapes and
organic building materials gave buildings a human
scale. But the effect of Roman civil architecture
was significant. The sheer size of space enclosed
within buildings like the basilica of London must
have been astonishing. This was an architecture of
dominance in which subject peoples were literally
made to feel small by buildings that epitomized
imperial power. Supremacy was accentuated by
the unyielding straight lines of both individual
buildings and planned settlements since these too
provided a marked contrast with the natural
curvilinear shapes dominant in the native realm.
163
52 – 2 Natufian Culture
In the archaeological record of the Natufian period,
from about 12,500 to 10,200 years ago, in the part
of the Middle East known as the Levant—roughly
east of the Mediterranean and north of the Arabian
Peninsula—we see clear evidence of agricultural
origins. The stone tools of the Natufians included
many sickle-shaped cutting blades that show a
pattern of wear characteristic of cereal harvesting.
Also, querns (hand mills) and other stone tools
used for processing grain occur in abundance at
Natufian sites, and many such tools show signs of
long, intensive use. Along with the sickle blades
are many grinding stones, primarily mortars and
pestles of limestone or basalt. There is also
evidence that these heavy grinding stones were
transported over long distances, more than 30
kilometers in some cases, and this is not something
known to have been done by people of preceding
periods. Fishhooks and weights for sinking fishing
nets attest to the growing importance of fish in the
diet in some areas. Stone vessels indicate an
increased need for containers, but there is no
evidence of Natufian clay working or pottery.
Studies of the teeth of Natufians also strongly
suggest that these people specialized in collecting
cereals and may have been cultivating them and in
the process of domesticating them, but they were
also still hunter—foragers who intensively hunted
gazelle and deer in more lush areas and wild goats
and equids in more arid zones.
The Natufians had a different settlement pattern
from that of their predecessors. Some of their base
camps were far larger (over 1,000 square meters)
than any of those belonging to earlier periods, and
they may have lived in some of these camps for
half the year or even more. In some of the camps,
people made foundations and other architectural
elements out of limestone blocks. Trade in shell,
obsidian, and other commodities seems to have
been on the rise, and anthropologists suspect that
the exchange of perishables (such as skins,
foodstuffs) and salt was also on the increase. With
the growing importance of wild cereals in the diet,
salt probably became for the first time a near
necessity: people who eat a lot of meat get many
essential salts from this diet, but diets based on
cereals can be deficient in salts. Salt was probably
also important as a food preservative in early
villages.
As always, there is more to a major cultural change
than simply a shift in economics. The Natufians
made (and presumably wore) beads and pendants
in many materials, including gemstones and marine
shells that had to be imported, and it is possible
that this ornamentation actually reflects a growing
sense of ethnic identity and perhaps some
differences in personal and group status. Cleverly
carved figurines of animals, women, and other
subjects occur in many sites, and Natufian period
cave paintings have been found in Anatolia, Syria,
and Iran. More than 400 Natufian burials have
been found, most of them simple graves set in
house floors. As archaeologist Belfer-Cohen notes,
these burials may reflect an ancestor cult and a
growing sense of community emotional ties and
attachment to a particular place, and toward the
end of the Natufian period, people in this area were
making a strict separation between living quarters
and burial grounds. In contrast with the Pleistocene
cultures of the Levant, Natufian culture appears to
have experienced considerable social change.
The question of why the Natufians differed from
their predecessors in these and other ways and
why they made these first steps toward farming as
a way of life remains unclear. There were climate
changes, of course, and growing aridity and rising
population densities may have forced them to
intensify the exploitation of cereals, which in turn
might have stimulated the development of sickles
and other tools and the permanent communities
that make agriculture efficient. But precisely how
these factors interacted with others at play is poorly
understood.

53 – 3 Paleolithic Cave Paintings
In any investigation of the origins of art, attention
focuses on the cave paintings created in Europe
during the Paleolithic era (c. 40,000-10,000 years
ago) such as those depicting bulls and other
animals in the Lascaux cave in France. Accepting
that they are the best preserved and most visible
signs of what was a global creative explosion, how
do we start to explain their appearance?
Instinctively, we may want to update the earliest
human artists by assuming that they painted for the
sheer joy of painting. The philosophers of Classical
Greece recognized it as a defining trait of humans
to "delight in works of imitation"—to enjoy the very
act and triumph of representation. If we were close
to a real lion or snake, we might feel frightened. But
a well- executed picture of a lion or snake will give
us pleasure. Why suppose that our Paleolithic
ancestors were any different?
This simple acceptance of art for art's sake has a
certain appeal. To think of Lascaux as a gallery
allows it to be a sort of special viewing place where
the handiwork of accomplished artists might be
displayed. Plausibly, daily existence in parts of
Paleolithic Europe may not have been so hard, with
an abundance of ready food and therefore the
leisure time for art. The problems with this
explanation, however, are various. In the first
place, the proliferation of archaeological
discoveries—and this includes some of the world's
innumerable rock art sites that cannot be dated—
has served to emphasize a remarkably limited
repertoire of subjects. The images that recur are
those of animals. Human figures are unusual, and
when they do make an appearance, they are rarely
done with the same attention to form accorded to
the animals. If Paleolithic artists were simply
seeking to represent the beauty of the world
around them, would they not have left a far greater
range of pictures—of trees, flowers, of the Sun and
the stars?
A further question to the theory of art for art's sake
is posed by the high incidence of Paleolithic
images that appear not to be imitative of any reality
whatsoever. These are geometrical shapes or
patterns consisting of dots or lines. Such marks
may be found isolated or repeated over a particular
surface but also scattered across more
recognizable forms. A good example of this may be
seen in the geologically spectacular grotto of
Pêche Merle, in the Lot region of France. Here we
encounter some favorite animals from the
Paleolithic repertoire—a pair of stout-bellied
horses. But over and around the horses' outlines
are multiple dark spots, daubed in disregard for the
otherwise naturalistic representation of animals.
What does such patterning imitate? There is also
the factor of location. The caves of Lascaux might
conceivably qualify as underground galleries, but
many other paintings have been found in recesses
totally unsuitable for any kind of viewing—tight
nooks and crannies that must have been awkward
even for the artists to penetrate, let alone for
anyone else wanting to see the art.
Finally, we may doubt the notion that the Upper
Paleolithic period was a paradise in which food
came readily, leaving humans ample time to amuse
themselves with art. For Europe it was still the Ice
Age. An estimate of the basic level of sustenance
then necessary for human survival has been
judged at 2200 calories per day. This
consideration, combined with the stark emphasis
upon animals in the cave art, has persuaded some
archaeologists that the primary motive behind
Paleolithic images must lie with the primary activity
of Paleolithic people: hunting.
Hunting is a skill. Tracking, stalking, chasing, and
killing the prey are difficult, sometimes dangerous
activities. What if the process could be made
easier—by art? In the early decades of the
twentieth century, Abbé Henri Breuil argued that
the cave paintings were all about “sympathetic
magic”. The artists strived diligently to make their
animal images evocative and realistic because they
were attempting to capture the spirit of their prey.
What could have prompted their studious attention
to making such naturalistic, recognizable images?
According to Breuil, the artists may have believed
that if a hunter were able to make a true likeness of
some animal, then that animal was virtually
trapped. Images, therefore, may have had the
magical capacity to confer success or luck in the
hunt.

59 – 3 Ancient Greek Pottery
An extremely important and long-standing industry
in ancient Greece was the ceramics industry, giving
rise to the huge number of pieces of pottery
archaeologists and historians pore over. In reality,
pottery production can almost be seen as a
combination of a natural resources-based economy
and a production-based economy, as the primary
material-good clay-was a result of the natural
geology. However, not all city-states made equal
use of their clay resources, and only two-Corinth
and Athens-were really active in pottery export in
the Archaic Age (750 -500 BC) and following.
As with weaving, pottery no doubt began as, and in
many places remained, a household industry,
probably practiced exclusively in the summer when
the clay and kindling wood were drier and easier to
transport and burn But evidence of a more
concentrated effort at production for export
appeared already in the Bronze Age (3000-1100 B
c.) and continued in the Dark Ages (1100-800 B c ),
as with the copious export of Euboean scyphi
(drinking cups) to such locations in the
Mediterranean as Cyprus, the Levant, and even
Italy. These were followed by the Corinthian cups
and scyphi, and finally the Athenian kylix (a shallow
type of wine goblet). The demand for Greek
vessels to drink out of appears to have stemmed
from a desire for Greek things to drink, and
amphorae and pithoi (storage vessels), especially
from Attica, also proliferated in the Mediterranean.
This need for commercial production led to the rise
of workshops and factories. Such workshops were
usually family-owned businesses run by the head
of the household, his sons (and possibly
daughters), and, depending on the size of the
industry, additional servants and/or slaves. The
general assumption concerning many professional
potters is that they were not citizens of the cities in
which they worked. In Athens, these were the
metics, or resident aliens, as well as slaves. The
identity of the workers in the primary ceramic
working area in Corinth-the Potters’ Quarter-is
uncertain. But an inscribed pottery shard naming
the Phoenician goddess Astarte suggests that
there were Phoenician immigrants (from what is
now Lebanon) working there, or at least a heavy
Phoenician influence.
Happily for modern researchers, many artisans
signed their works. This gives an idea not only of
who these ancient ceramicists were, but also of
how labor was divided Modern scholars have the
names of a few potter-families from sixth-century B
c Athens: Nearkhos, who worked with his sons
Tleson and Ergoteles: Ergotimos, who was
succeeded by his son Eukheiros (literally, “Good
Hand”); and Amasis and his son Kleophrades, who
produced pottery from the mid-sixth century B c to
the dawn of the fifth. The signatures indicate,
however, that although these men fashioned and
fired the ceramics, others were employed to paint
the more elaborate figural vases. Such artists
traveled around to different workshops, like the
sixth-century Epictetus, whose name as a painter
accompanied about six different names of potters.
Starting around 550 B.C., numbers were scratched
onto the bottoms of some vases, often appearing
after the name of the vase in full or abbreviated
form. These may have been batch numbers,
indicating groups of pots fired together and
intended for specific merchants or markets. The
merchants were also indicated by markings on
some vases, whereby a signature sign or
abbreviation indicated to which exporter or importer
in the receiving city the pottery was destined In the
sixth century B c ., such merchants were frequently
lomans (Greeks from cities on the Mediterranean
coast of Asia Minor), who were responsible for
much of the import-export business at Naucratis in
the south and Gravisca in the west.
But the most important markings from the point of
view of economics are the actual “price tags"
etched into some pots. An important difference in
the price occurred between painted and
undecorated vases, with a markup of anywhere
from 25 to 50 percent for the figural vases. Clearly,
this was because the pottery manufacturer had to
pay for the additional labor.

58 – 1 The Development of Instrumental Music
Until the sixteenth century, almost all music was
written for the voice rather than for musical
instruments. Even during the Renaissance (from
the fourteenth to the sixteenth century),
instrumental music was, for the most part, the
result of substituting an instrument for a voice in
music written for singing or dancing. The
seventeenth century marked the rise of music that
lacked extramusical meaning Like a mathematical
equation or geometric formula, the instrumental
music of the early modern era carried no explicit
narrative content-it was neither a vehicle of
religious expression nor a means of supporting a
secular (nonreligious) vocalized text. Such music
was written without consideration for the
associational content traditionally provided by a set
of sung lyrics. The idea of music as an aesthetic
exercise, composed for its own sake rather than to
serve a religious or communal purpose, was a
notable feature of the seventeenth century and one
that has distinguished modern Western European
music from the musical traditions of Asia and
Africa.
Not surprisingly, the rise of instrumental music was
accompanied by improvements in instruments and
refinements in tuning Indeed, instrumental music
came to dominate musical composition at the very
moment that Western musicians were perfecting
such stringed instruments as the violin, viola, and
cello and such keyboard instruments as the organ
and harpsichord. By the early eighteenth century,
musicians were adopting the system of tuning
known as equal temperament, whereby the octave
was divided into twelve half-steps of equal size
Johann Sebastian Bach’s Well-Tempered Clavier
(1722) was an attempt to popularize this system to
a skeptical musical public. The new attention paid
to improving instruments and systematizing tuning
mirrored the efforts of scientists and philosophers
to bring precision and uniformity to the tools and
methods for scientific inquiry.
In the seventeenth century, northern Italy was the
world center for the manufacture of violins. The
Amati, Guarneri, and Stradivari families of
Cremona, Italy, established the techniques of
making high-quality violins that were sought in all of
the great courts of Europe Transmitted from father
to son, the construction techniques used to
produce these instruments were guarded so
secretly that modern violinmakers have never
successfully imitated them. Elsewhere, around
1650, earlier instruments were standardized and
refined. Also during this period amateur music
making was widespread, and professional
performance also took a great leap forward, as a
new breed of virtuosi inspired the writing of
treatises on performance techniques.
Three main types of composition-the sonata., the
suite, and the concerto-dominated seventeenthcentury instrumental music. All three reflect the
baroque taste for dramatic contrasts in tempo and
texture. The sonata (from the Italian word for
“sounded,” that is, music played and not sung) is a
piece written for a few instruments-often no more
than one or two. It usually consisted of three
movements of contrasting tempo-fast/slow/fasteach based on a song or dance form of the time.
The suite, written for any combination of
instruments, is a sequence or series of movements
derived from various European court or folk
dances-for example, the sarabande, the pavane,
the minuet, and gigue, or jig Henry Purcell (1659-
1695) in England, Francois Couperin (1668-1733)
in France, and Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-
1750) in Germany all contributed to the
development of the suite as a musical genre.
Finally, the concerto (from the same root as concert
ato, which describes opposing or contrasting
bodies of sound) is a composition consisting of two
groups of instruments, one small and the other
large, playing in dialogue. The typical baroque
concerto, the concerto grosso (“large concerto")
featured several movements whose number and
kind varied considerably.
The leading Italian instrumental composer of the
baroque era was Antonio Vivaldi (1678 -1741)
Vivaldi wrote some 450 concertos He systematized
the concerto grosso into a three- movement form
(fast/slow/fast) and increased the distinctions
between solo and ensemble groups in each
movement Of the many exciting compositions
Vivaldi wrote for solo violin and ensemble, the most
glorious is The Four Seasons, a group of four violin
concertos, each of which musically describes a
single season.

62 – 2 The Use of Jade and Bronze in China
Jade and bronze were chosen early in China’s
history as the materials for society’s most precious
objects. The main reason for this is very
straightforward. Both materials are beautiful to the
eye and in the case of jade, also to the touch. Jade
is a dense stone that can be ground to smooth, soft
surfaces and glows in subtle greens, grays, and
browns. Bronze, an alloy of tin and copper, is a
light, bright gold color when polished.
Jade was employed (c. 4500 B c ) for exceptionally
elegant versions of utilitarian stone tools; bronze
was the choice (c. 1650 B c ) for the highest-quality
cooking pots. Made in jade, the tools were not for
daily use but for displays of status and power, and
the bronze cooking pots were not for ordinary
meals but were reserved for offerings of food and
wine to ancestors. Jade and bronze were thus
used for special ritual or ceremonial versions of
standard everyday items.
The materials themselves were scarcer and
required more labor to work than ordinary stone
and ceramic. That this was the case must have
been as clear in the past as it is today and must
have marked the objects as in some way
exceptional. Not only the materials but also the
ways in which they were worked demonstrated
their exalted functions. Jade scepters (ceremonial
objects of various shapes that were carried by
influential people as symbols of authority) were
ground more thinly than the stone tools they
copied, such as axes or reaping knives. Had they
been used to chop down a tree, they would have
broken. Bronze cooking pots were made in intricate
forms, with extra knobs and handles and dense
decoration all of which would have been
impracticable on everyday ceramics.
There would be no point in using these scarce and
labor-intensive materials in place of common ones
if they could not be immediately recognized as
outstanding. Craftsmanship was therefore directed
toward exploiting and displaying the particular
qualities of jade and bronze that make them
recognizably different from ordinary stone and
ceramic. These qualities had to be made visually
noticeable. Other qualities, such as weight or
texture, can only be appreciated by holding the
object, and fewer people will have the opportunity
to pick it up and feel its features with their hands
than will be able to glance at it quickly.
Visual distinctions deployed to separate the
ceremonial from the everyday can also be used to
refer to smaller differences in the ranking of ritual
items, separating those owned by kings from those
owned by nobles. Such differences can be in size
or mass—one piece being larger or thicker than
another—or in skill, with one being better crafted
than another. We make such judgments when
looking at ancient objects today, and it seems likely
that some sort of similar assessment was made at
the time.
Two hierarchies, both visible to the eye, were thus
achieved. First and most fundamental was a
hierarchy of function, the ritual object standing
above the everyday object. Second was the
hierarchy within each category, with the more
elaborately worked and often larger object higher
up the scale. The rich and powerful owned the jade
scepters and bronze vessels. What is more, these
scepters and vessels not only expressed or
reflected the status of their owners but they also
probably reinforced it. In this way, jades and
bronzes became bound up with the religious and
political structures of the early Chinese state, and
they remained so linked up to the twentieth
century.
It is therefore not surprising that at times when
rulers and their courts wished to assert their
authority, they commissioned large numbers of
conspicuous bronzes. Further, when they wished to
distract attention from weaknesses in society, they
emphasized their power even more by increasing
expenditure on ritual objects. Thus changes in the
aesthetic qualities of jades and bronzes can inform
us about the society that produced them.
Later generations of Chinese scholars of the Song
Dynasty (A.D. 960-1279) quickly recognized the
link between the bronzes and jades and political
power. In their search for political legitimacy, they
collected and studied ancient artifacts, pursuits that
in themselves reinforced the high status of jade
and bronze in society. From the idea that political
power resided in ancient objects, including
calligraphy and painting, grew the first art
collections.

69 – 3 Ancient Southwestern Cultures
Around 2,500 years ago, Amerindian peoples
began to live in settled communities in what is now
the southwestern United States, growing maize –
a crop unique to the New World – together with
squash and, later, beans. These cultures
developed advanced technologies that allowed
them to manipulate their environment and thrive in
its arid conditions, though ultimately environmental
factors may also have led to their disappearance.
One of these cultures, the Hohokam, practiced
irrigation-based agriculture. Knowledge of
Hohokam irrigation systems is based on
archaeological remains found in southern Arizona
as well as on extrapolation from technologies
currently in use. Because the land was desert with
less than 10 inches of rainfall a year, agriculture
required catchment dams, irrigation canals, and
water conservation. Between A.D. 300 and 900,
the Hohokam manipulated the arid environment by
building large canals, some as wide as 30 feet
across, 7 feet deep, and 8 miles long, that could
fertilize as many as 8,000 acres at a time with
water from the Salt and Gila river systems.
The Hohokam could grow crops and store them
throughout the year, producing a continual supply
of food. An environmental consequence of irrigated
agriculture, however, is that water from the rivers
leaches out salts, drawing them up from the subsoil
and leaving salinated (salty) topsoil. Just as the
Mesopotamian settlements of the Near East were
abandoned owing to salinization of the land, the
Hohokam may have been forced to abandon their
villages. Alternatively, they may have remained
evolving and adapting to changed conditions. By
the time the Spanish arrived in the region in the
sixteenth century, they met Amerindians called
Akimel O’odham, who were still practicing a form of
irrigation, but not on the enormous scale developed
by the Hohokam. Other explanations for the
disappearance of Hohokam culture include
flooding, drought, earthquakes, and deforestation.
A second group of southwestern peoples, the
Anasazi, also developed advanced technologies for
manipulating their environment. They constructed
large multistoried communal houses in villages: or
pueblos, along the edges of a river in the bottom of
New Mexico’s Chaco Canyon where they planted
crops. The communities consisted of many small
villages with larger central cities containing fourstory apartments and ramrod-straight roads that
linked Chaco Canyon with other communities in the
Southwest.
One Anasazi pueblo, Mesa Verde, illustrates the
sophistication with which these peoples
transformed their environment. Mesa Verde is
situated 7,000 to 8,000 feet above sea level on a
vast forested plateau into which erosion has cut
numerous steep-walled canyons. Mesa Verde
culture and agriculture developed gradually over
time. The people of the earliest culture, from
around A.D. 500 to 750, were basket weavers who
lived underground in pit houses. Around A.D. 750
to 1,100, they added ceremonial chambers called
kivas and began building houses above ground out
of bricks. Between A.D. 1,100 and 1,300, they
reached the peak of their complex culture, building
ladders ascending to the cliff areas as well as
pathways descending to agricultural fields in the
valleys. The vast agricultural network covered
some 80 square miles of development, supporting
numerous pueblos located about 1,800 to 2,000
feet above the river.
Not only did the Anasazi build roads and pueblos,
they also put their understanding of astronomy to
practical use. In particular, the Anasazi attained the
ability to predict the advent of growing and
harvesting seasons based on arrival of solstices
(longest and shortest days) around June 21 and
December 21 and equinoxes (days with equal
periods of light and darkness) around March 21
and September 21. They did so by building an
observatory on Fajada Butte in Chaco Canyon, a
stone-slab structure assembled so that on solstices
and equinoxes, a sliver of sunlight entered between
two stones and fell on a petroglyph (an image
carved onto a rock) in a characteristic way. With
this knowledge they gained a measure of control
over the hazards of an environment.
The Anasazi disappeared from their homeland at
the height of their cultural development around the
end of the thirteenth century. Deforestation, social
disruption, and the onset of an 11-year drought
around A.D. 1280 (as evidenced by the narrowness
of tree-ring growth) may have been factors leading
to the abandonment of the pueblos.

WRITING / PRINTING
39 – 1 Early Writing Systems
Scholars agree that writing originated somewhere
in the Middle East, probably Mesopotamia, around
the fourth millennium B.C.E. It is from the great
libraries and word-hoards of these ancient lands
that the first texts emerged. They were written on
damp clay tablets with a wedged (or V-shaped)
stick; since the Latin word for wedge is cunea, the
texts are called cuneiform. The clay tablets usually
were not fired; sun drying was probably reckoned
enough to preserve the text for as long as it was
being used. Fortunately, however, many tablets
survived because they were accidentally fired when
the buildings they were stored in burned.
Cuneiform writing lasted for some 3,000 years, in a
vast line of succession that ran through Sumer,
Akkad, Assyria, Nineveh, and Babylon, and
preserved for us fifteen languages in an area
represented by modern-day Iraq, Syria, and
western Iran. The oldest cuneiform texts recorded
the transactions of tax collectors and merchants,
the receipts and bills of sale of an urban society.
They had to do with things like grain, goats, and
real estate. Later, Babylonian scribes recorded the
laws and kept other kinds of records. Knowledge
conferred power. As a result, the scribes were
assigned their own goddess, Nisaba, later replaced
by the god Nabu of Borsippa, whose symbol is
neither weapon nor dragon but something far more
fearsome, the cuneiform stick.
Cuneiform texts on science, astronomy, medicine,
and mathematics abound, some offering
astoundingly precise data. One tablet records the
speed of the Moon over 248 days; another
documents an early sighting of Halley's Comet,
from September 22 to September 28, 164 B.C.E.
More esoteric texts attempt to explain old
Babylonian customs, such as the procedure for
curing someone who is ill, which included rubbing
tar and gypsum on the sick person's door and
drawing a design at the foot of the person's bed.
What is clear from the vast body of texts (some
20,000 tablets were found in King Ashurbanipal's
library at Nineveh) is that scribes took pride in their
writing and knowledge.
The foremost cuneiform text, the Babylonian Epic
of Gilgamesh, deals with humankind's attempts to
conquer time. In it, Gilgamesh, king and warrior, is
crushed by the death of his best friend and so sets
out on adventures that prefigure mythical heroes of
ancient Greek legends such as Hercules. His goal
is not just to survive his ordeals but to make sense
of this life. Remarkably, versions of Gilgamesh
span 1,500 years, between 2100 B.C.E and 600
B.C.E., making the story the epic of an entire
civilization.
The ancient Egyptians invented a different way of
writing and a new substance to write on—papyrus,
a precursor of paper, made from a wetland plant.
The Greeks had a special name for this writing:
hieroglyphic, literally "sacred writing". This, they
thought, was language fit for the gods, which
explains why it was carved on walls of pyramids
and other religious structures. Perhaps
hieroglyphics are Egypt's great contribution to the
history of writing: hieroglyphic wiring, in use from
3100 B.C.E. until 394 C.E., resulted in the creation
of texts that were fine art as well as
communication. Egypt gave us the tradition of the
scribe not just as educated person but as artist and
calligrapher.
Scholars have detected some 6,000 separate
hieroglyphic characters in use over the history of
Egyptian writing, but it appears that never more
than a thousand were in use during any one period.
It still seems a lot to recall, but what was lost in
efficiency was more than made up for in the beauty
and richness of the texts. Writing was meant to
impress the eye with the vastness of creating itself.
Each symbol or glyph - the flowering reed
(pronounced like V), the owl ("m"), the quail chick
("w"), etcetera - was a tiny work of art. Manuscripts
were compiled with an eye to the overall design.
Egyptologists have noticed that the glyphs that
constitute individual words were sometimes
shuffled to make the text more pleasing to the eye
with little regard for sound or sense.

73 – 2 Writing History
Historians throughout the ages have been beset by
many pitfalls in their attempts to write
history.Modern historians writing the history of
Africa not only face problems similar to those
experienced by their colleagues writing the history
of other cultures.Most medieval African societies
south of the Sahara lacked an alphabet and a
written language.African written languages were
confined mainly to Ethiopia,to Sudan, and to the
maritime cities of the east coast. Early Greek,
Roman, Amharic, Fulani,and Swahili texts still
survive to give us some idea of bygone
days.Future collectors will almost certainly find
additional records when they search for documents
in North Africa and in faraway countries like Iran
and Saudi Arabia.In tropical countries,however,old
papers are preserved only with great difficulty,for
white ants and atmospheric humidity pose serious
problems even to modern archivists.Early record
keepers were even less equal to their task,and
much material has been lost or destroyed.
The lack of written material means that we shall
never be able to read,for example,the memoirs of a
king of the Luba people in the eighteenth century.
Worse still,we cannot draw on administrative
archives.Dull as they look, administrative files have
a peculiar value denied to other written
records.They are composed of documents drawn
up or used in the course of an administrative or
executive transaction of which they had formed a
part.This does not necessarily make official
memorandums, communiques, and such more
reliable, for officials often enough were dishonest
with their inferiors and superiors alike. But-unlike
the authors of so many biographies-they hardly
ever wrote in order to deceive posterity; hence,
archival evidence has an unusual degree of
authenticity. The lack of such material makes the
historian's job hard indeed. For where there is no
writing,there are large areas of human behavior
that cannot be described accurately except by
speculative extrapolations from literate cultures or
by conjectures determined to a large extent by our
own cultural preconceptions.
Some historians,therefore,try to supplement their
sources with information from indigenous traditions
and folklore,heroic legends,genealogical tables,and
personal reminiscences.The use of oral
history,however,again presents many
difficulties.Historians can look at the same
document again and again;so can their
successors.An artifact can be preserved in a
museum,and different conclusions can be arrived
at by going over the same evidence again and
again. But two or three people cannot interview the
same informant twice;even should they do so,they
will not necessarily elicit the same information,for
the interviewers themselves help impose a
subjective pattern on the information they
obtain.Human witnesses,moreover,will remember
previous interviews;their memory can never be
erased like a magnetic tape in such a way that they
can be questioned over and over again without
changing their answers at least to some degree.
Admittedly,it is easy to underestimate the value of
material elicited by oral historians who investigate
preliterate societies.Professional poets and singers
may faithfully record the same lay or the same
genealogical table for many generations, for their
memory is beyond question.Nevertheless,oral
tradition is always subject to change.The Lunda
people,who dwell on the Luapula River, are,for
instance,very interested in their own past.But as
lan Cunnison,a British anthropologist,observes,"this
is not history as we know it.It is the handing on of
what is already known or believed,and it does not
involve the asking of questions about the past,and
the search for the answer to them."
This does not mean that oral traditions are without
value to historians. They enlarge their
imagination,they help them pose new
questions,and they tell them a great deal
concerning a people's culture; they also provide a
substratum of fact.They are, however, difficult to
interpret,and the conventional historian's
intellectual tools may often prove inadequate for
the task. Oral traditions, moreover, like all other
forms of evidence, always stand in need of
corroboration and can never be accepted on the
basis of their own authority.
171
46 – 1 The Origins of Writing
It was in Egypt and Mesopotamia (modern-day
Iraq) that civilization arose, and it is there that we
find the earliest examples of that key feature of
civilization, writing. These examples, in the form of
inscribed clay tablets that date to shortly before
3000 B.C.E., have been discovered among the
archaeological remains of the Sumerians, a gifted
people settled in southern Mesopotamia.
The Egyptians were not far behind in developing
writing, but we cannot follow the history of their
writing in detail because they used a perishable
writing material. In ancient times the banks of the
Nile were lined with papyrus plants, and from the
papyrus reeds the Egyptians made a form of paper;
it was excellent in quality but, like any paper,
fragile. Mesopotamia’s rivers boasted no such
useful reeds, but its land did provide good clay, and
as a consequence the clay tablet became the
standard material. Though clumsy and bulky it has
a virtue dear to archaeologists: it is durable. Fire,
for example, which is death to papyrus paper or
other writing materials such as leather and wood,
simply bakes it hard, thereby making it even more
durable. So when a conqueror set a Mesopotamian
palace ablaze, he helped ensure the survival of any
clay tablets in it. Clay, moreover, is cheap, and
forming it into tablets is easy, factors that helped
the clay tablet become the preferred writing
material not only throughout Mesopotamia but far
outside it as well, in Syria, Asia Minor, Persia, and
even for a while in Crete and Greece. Excavators
have unearthed clay tablets in all these lands. In
the Near East they remained in use for more than
two and a half millennia, and in certain areas they
lasted down to the beginning of the common era
until finally yielding, once and for all, to more
convenient alternatives.
The Sumerians perfected a style of writing suited to
clay. This script consists of simple shapes,
basically just wedge shapes and lines that could
easily be incised in soft clay with a reed or wooden
stylus; scholars have dubbed it cuneiform from the
wedge-shaped marks (cunei in Latin) that are its
hallmark Although the ingredients are merely
wedges and lines, there are hundreds of
combinations of these basic forms that stand for
different sounds or words. Learning these complex
signs required long training and much practice;
inevitably, literacy was largely limited to a small
professional class, the scribes.
The Akkadians conquered the Sumerians around
the middle of the third millennium B.C.E., and they
took over the various cuneiform signs used for
writing Sumerian and gave them sound and word
values that fit their own language. The Babylonians
and Assyrians did the same, and so did peoples in
Syria and Asia Minor. The literature of the
Sumerians was treasured throughout the Near
East, and long after Sumerian ceased to be
spoken, the Babylonians and Assyrians and others
kept it alive as a literary language, the way
Europeans kept Latin alive after the fall of Rome.
For the scribes of these non-Sumerian languages,
training was doubly demanding since they had to
know the values of the various cuneiform signs for
Sumerian as well as for their own language.
The contents of the earliest clay tablets are simple
notations of numbers of commodities—animals,
jars, baskets, etc. Writing, it would appear, started
as a primitive form of bookkeeping. Its use soon
widened to document the multitudinous things and
acts that are involved in daily life, from simple
inventories of commodities to complicated
governmental rules and regulations.
Archaeologists frequently find clay tablets in
batches. The batches, some of which contain
thousands of tablets, consist for the most part of
documents of the types just mentioned: bills,
deliveries, receipts, inventories, loans, marriage
contracts, divorce settlements, court judgments,
and so on. These records of factual matters were
kept in storage to be available for reference-they
were, in effect, files, or, to use the term preferred
by specialists in the ancient Near East, archives.
Now and then these files include pieces of writing
that are of a distinctly different order, writings that
do not merely record some matter of fact but
involve creative intellectual activity. They range
from simple textbook material to literature-and they
make an appearance very early, even from the
third millennium B C E.

49 – 2 Movable Type
Nothing divided the medieval world in Europe more
decisively from the Early Modern period than
printing with movable type. It was a German
invention and the culmination of a complex
process. The world of antiquity had recorded its
writings mainly on papyrus. Between 200 B.C and
A.D 300, this was supplemented by vellum, calf
skin treated and then smoothed by pumice stone.
To this in late Roman times was added parchment,
similarly made from the smoothed skin of sheep or
goats. In the early Middle Ages, Europe imported
an industrial process from China, which turned
almost any kind of fibrous material into pulp that
was then spread in sheets. This was known as
cloth parchment. By about 1150, the Spanish had
developed the first mill for making cheap paper (a
word contracted from "papyrus", which became the
standard term). One of the most important
phenomena of the later Middle Ages was the
growing availability of cheap paper. Even in
England, where technology lagged far behind, a
sheet of paper, or eight octavo pages, cost only a
penny by the fifteenth century.
In the years 1446-1448, two German goldsmiths,
Johannes Gutenberg and Johann Fust, made use
of cheap paper to introduce a critical improvement
in the way written pages were reproduced. Printing
from wooden blocks was the old method; what the
Germans did was to invent movable type for the
letterpress. It had three merits: it could be used
repeatedly until worn out; it was cast in metal from
a mold and so could be renewed without difficulty;
and it made lettering uniform. In 1450, Gutenberg
began work on his Bible, the first printed book,
known as the Gutenberg. It was completed in 1455
and is a marvel. As Gutenberg, apart from getting
the key idea, had to solve a lot of practical
problems, including imposing paper and ink into the
process and the actual printing itself, for which he
adapted the screw press used by winemakers, it is
amazing that his first product does not look at all
rudimentary. Those who handle it are struck by its
clarity and quality.
Printing was one of those technical revolutions that
developed its own momentum at extraordinary
speed. Europe in the fifteenth century was a place
where intermediate technology - that is, workshops
with skilled craftspeople - was well established and
spreading fast, especially in Germany and Italy.
Such workshops were able to take on printing
easily, and it thus became Europe's first true
industry. The process was aided by two factors: the
new demand for cheap classical texts and the
translation of the Latin Bible into "modern"
languages. Works of reference were also in
demand. Presses sprang up in several German
cities, and by 1470, Nuremberg, Germany had
established itself as the center of the international
publishing trade, printing books from 24 presses
and distributing them at trade fairs all over western
and central Europe. The old monastic scriptoriamonastery workshops where monks copied texts
by hand-worked closely alongside the new
presses, continuing to produce the luxury goods
that movable-type printing could not yet supply.
Printing, however, was primarily aimed at a cheap
mass sale.
Although there was no competition between the
technologies, there was rivalry between nations.
The Italians made energetic and successful efforts
to catch up with Germany. Their most successful
scriptorium quickly imported two leading German
printers to set up presses in their book-producing
shop. German printers had the disadvantage of
working with the complex typeface that the Italians
sneeringly referred to as "Gothic" and that later
became known as black letter. Outside Germany,
readers found this typeface disagreeable. The
Italians, on the other hand, had a clear typeface
known as roman that became the type of the
future.
Hence, although the Germans made use of the
paper revolution to introduce movable type, the
Italians went far to regain the initiative by their
artistry. By 1500 there were printing firms in 60
German cities, but there were 150 presses in
Venice alone. However, since many nations and
governments wanted their own presses, the trade
quickly became international. The cumulative
impact of this industrial spread was spectacular.
Before printing, only the very largest libraries, of
which there were a dozen in Europe, had as many
as 600 books. The total number of books on the
entire Continent was well under 100,000. But by
1500, after only 45 years of the printed book, there
were 9 million in circulation.

53 – 1 Evidence of the Earliest Writing
Although literacy appeared independently in several
parts of the prehistoric world, the earliest evidence of
writing is the cuneiform Sumerian script on the clay
tablets of azncient Mesopotamia, which,
archaeological detective work has revealed, had its
origins in the accounting practices of commercial
activity. Researchers demonstrated that preliterate
people, to keep track of the goods they produced and
exchanged, created a system of accounting using
clay tokens as symbolic representations of their
products. Over many thousands of years, the symbols
evolved through several stages of abstraction until
they became wedge-shaped (cuneiform) signs on
clay tablets, recognizable as writing.
The original tokens (circa 8500 B.C.E.) were threedimensional solid shapes-tiny spheres, cones, disks,
and cylinders. A debt of six units of grain and eight
head of livestock, for example might have been
represented by six conical and eight cylindrical
tokens. To keep batches of tokens together, an
innovation was introduced (circa 3250 B. C. E.)
whereby they were sealed inside clay envelopes that
could be broken open and counted when it came time
for a debt to be repaid. But because the contents of
the envelopes could easily be forgotten, twodimensional representations of the three-dimensional
tokens were impressed into the surface of the
envelopes before they were sealed. Eventually,
having two sets of equivalent symbols-the internal
tokens and external markings-came to seem
redundant, so the tokens were eliminated (circa 3250-
3100 B.C.E.), and only solid clay tablets with twodimensional symbols were retained. Over time, the
symbols became more numerous, varied, and
abstract and came to represent more than trade
commodities, evolving eventually into cuneiform
writing.
The evolution of the symbolism is reflected in the
archaeological record first of all by the increasing
complexity of the tokens themselves. The earliest
tokens, dating from about 10,000 to 6,000 years ago,
were of only the simplest geometric shapes. But
about 3500 B.C.E., more complex tokens came into
common usage, including many naturalistic forms
shaped like miniature tools, furniture, fruit, and
humans. The earlier, plain tokens were counters for
agricultural products, whereas the complex ones
stood for finished products, such as bread, oil,
perfume, wool, and rope, and for items produced in
workshops, such as metal, bracelets, types of cloth,
garments, mats, pieces of furniture, tools, and a
variety of stone and pottery vessels. The signs
marked on clay tablets likewise evolved from simple
wedges, circles, ovals, and triangles based on the
plain tokens to pictographs derived from the complex
tokens.
Before this evidence came to light, the inventors of
writing were assumed by researchers to have been
an intellectual elite. Some, for example, hypothesized
that writing emerged when members of the priestly
caste agreed among themselves on written signs. But
the association of the plain tokens with the first
farmers and of the complex tokens with the first
artisans-and the fact that the token-and-envelope
accounting system invariably represented only smallscale transactions-testifies to the relatively modest
social status of the creators of writing.
And not only of literacy, but numeracy (the
representation of quantitative concepts) as well. The
evidence of the tokens provides further confirmation
that mathematics originated in people's desire to keep
records of flocks and other goods. Another immensely
significant step occurred around 3100 B.C.E., when
Sumerian accountants extended the token-based
signs to include the first real numerals. Previously,
units of grain had been represented by direct one-toone correspondence ―by repeating the token or
symbol for a unit of grain the required number of
times. The accountants, however, devised numeral
signs distinct from commodity signs, so that eighteen
units of grain could be indicated by preceding a single
grain symbol with a symbol denoting "18." Their
invention of abstract numerals and abstract counting
was one of the most revolutionary advances in the
history of mathematics.
What was the social status of the anonymous
accountants who produced this breakthrough? The
immense volume of clay tablets unearthed in the ruins
of the Sumerian temples where the accounts were
kept suggests a social differentiation within the scribal
class, with a virtual army of lower-ranking tabulators
performing the monotonous job of tallying
commodities. We can only speculate as to how high
or low the inventors of true numerals were in the
scribal hierarchy, but it stands to reason that this
laborsaving innovation would have been the
brainchild of the lower-ranking types whose drudgery
is eased.

60 – 2 The Revolution of Cheap Print
The first half of the nineteenth century saw
dramatic changes in the economics of the printed
word in both the United States and Europe, though
the changes generally happened earlier and on a
wider basis in America. In the 1830s and 1840s,
sharp reductions in prices for newspapers and
books in America highlighted the advent of an era
of cheap print. Now there were daily newspapers
that instead of 6 cents per copy sold for a penny or
two. Now there were novels that instead of an
earlier price of $2 sold for 25 cents or less, when
the same books in Britain cost the equivalent of
more than $7. So steep were the declines in the
price of print over so short a period that they
amounted to an information-price revolution, the
first of several such episodes of declining prices
that have profoundly affected information and
culture during the past two centuries. Two midnineteenth-century American cultural innovations,
the "penny press” and the “dime novel,” were
actually named for their low price. These were
criticized for being cheap in both senses of that
word low in price and low in taste. But low price did
not necessarily mean lowbrow increasingly, book
publishers issued even the most esteemed works
in cheap as well as expensive editions to reach as
wide a public as possible. The information-price
revolution also affected religious and political
publishing, as reading became a basis of mass
persuasion for the first time in history.
Cheap print was not entirely unprecedented. In
seventeenth- and eighteenth-century England and
France, cheap collections of stories, ballads, and
other miscellany had circulated among the lower
classes. But since only a minority of the poor could
read, most listened while a few read aloud; thus
cheap print reached not so much a reading as a
listening public. The expansion of cheap print in the
nineteenth century in America and Europe was on
a much larger scale, and it took place during a
great increase in popular literacy. Together these
amounted to a cultural watershed. Traditionally,
even in literate homes, books and other
publications had been relatively rare and treasured
objects; reading meant returning to a few texts,
especially religious works. But with the explosion of
print, reading became more varied, and readers
scanned newspapers, magazines, and cheap
books that they soon passed on or discarded.
Intensive reading of religious and other works did
not disappear, but reading became an increasingly
common form of diversion as well as devotion.
The usual explanation for the rise of cheap print
emphasizes new technology. Unquestionably, the
full development of cheap print could not have
happened without technological change. Print,
however, had already become cheaper in America
before technological advances played a significant
role; new technology arrived once the process was
under way, not at the beginning. This was no
accident: the continuing expansion of print created
an incentive for technological innovation. To
conceive of technology as the causal force is to
understate the prior importance of politics, culture,
and markets in creating the conditions that allowed
investments in new technology to pay off.
Cheap print was public policy in America. While
European governments taxed newspapers and
other publications, the United States let them go
tax free and even subsidized them, to a degree,
through the postal system. The rise of cheap books
and other forms of cheap print in the United States
also reflected distinctive patterns of nineteenthcentury American consumer markets. As the
economic historian Nathan Rosenberg remarks,
citing the cases of cutlery, guns, boots, and
clothing, “Americans readily accepted products
which had been deliberately designed for low cost,
mass production methods" at a time when
handmade goods persisted in Britain Books fit this
pattern. Americans had not been primarily
responsible for introducing new manufacturing
technology to the production of books. On the
contrary, most of the key advances in printing and
papermaking before 1850 had traveled west across
the Atlantic rather than the reverse. But the
industrialization of book production proceeded
more rapidly in the United States, where the market
by the middle decades of the century was not only
larger than in Britain but also apparently more
sensitive to price than to quality, perhaps because
elite readers constituted a smaller proportion of
book buyers.

HISTORY / SOCIETIES / ECONOMY /
BIOGRAPHY / ANCIENT SOCIETIES
07 – 2 Ancient Rome and Greece
There is a quality of cohesiveness about the
Roman world that applied neither to Greece nor
perhaps to any other civilization, ancient or
modern. Like the stone of Roman wall, which were
held together both by the regularity of the design
and by that peculiarly powerful Roman cement, so
the various parts of the Roman realm were bonded
into a massive, monolithic entity by physical,
organizational, and psychological controls. The
physical bonds included the network of military
garrisons, which were stationed in every province,
and the network of stone-built roads that linked the
provinces with Rome. The organizational bonds
were based on the common principles of law and
administration and on the universal army of officials
who enforced common standards of conduct. The
psychological controls were built on fear and
punishment—on the absolute certainty that anyone
or anything that threatened the authority of Rome
would be utterly destroyed.
The source of Roman obsession with unity and
cohesion may well have lain in the pattern of
Rome’s early development. Whereas Greece had
grown from scores of scattered cities, Rome grew
from one single organism. While the Greek world
had expanded along the Mediterranean seas lanes,
the Roman world was assembled by territorial
conquest. Of course, the contrast is not quite so
stark: in Alexander the Great the Greeks had found
the greatest territorial conqueror of all time; and the
Romans, once they moved outside Italy, did not fail
to learn the lessons of sea power. Yet the essential
difference is undeniable. The key to the Greek
world lay in its high-powered ships; the key to
Roman power lay in its marching legions. The
Greeks were wedded to the sea; the Romans, to
the land. The Greek was a sailor at heart; the
Roman, a landsman.
Certainly, in trying to explain the Roman
phenomenon, one would have to place great
emphasis on this almost instinct for the territorial
imperative. Roman priorities lay in the organization,
exploitation, and defense of their territory. In all
probability it was the fertile plain of Latium, where
the Latins who founded Rome originated, that
created the habits and skills of landed settlement,
landed property, landed economy, landed
administration, and a land-based society. From this
arose the Roman genius for military organization
and orderly government. In turn, a deep attachment
to the land, and to the stability which rural life
engenders, fostered the Roman virtues: gravitas, a
sense of responsibility, pietas, a sense of devotion
to family and country, and iustitia, a sense of the
natural order.
Modern attitudes to Roman civilization range from
the infinitely impressed to the thoroughly disgusted.
As always, there are the power worshippers,
especially among historians, who are predisposed
to admire whatever is strong, who feel more
attracted to the might of Rome than to the subtlety
of Greece. At the same time, there is a solid body
of opinion that dislikes Rome. For many, Rome is
at best the imitator and the continuator of Greece
on a larger scale. Greek civilization had quality;
Rome, mere quantity. Greece was original; Rome,
derivative. Greece had style; Rome had money.
Greece was the inventor; Rome, the research and
development division. Such indeed was the opinion
of some of the more intellectual Romans. “Had the
Greeks held novelty in such disdain as we,” asked
Horace in his epistle, “what work of ancient date
would now exist?”
Rome’s debt to Greece was enormous. The
Romans adopted Greek religion and moral
philosophy. In literature, Greek writers were
consciously used as models by their Latin
successors. It was absolutely accepted that an
educated Roman should be fluent in Greek. In
speculative philosophy and the sciences, the
Romans made virtually no advance on early
achievements.
Yet it would be wrong to suggest that Rome was
somehow a junior partner in Greco-Roman
civilization. The Roman genius was projected into
new spheres—especially into those of law, military
organization, administration, and engineering.
Moreover, the tensions that arose within the
Roman state produced literary and artistic
sensibilities of the highest order. It was no accident
that many leading Roman soldiers and statesmen
were writers of high caliber.

07 – 3 Agriculture, Iron, and the Bantu Peoples
There is evidence of agriculture in Africa prior to
3000 B.C.. It may have developed independently,
but many scholars believe that the spread of
agriculture and iron throughout Africa linked it to
the major centers of the Near East and
Mediterranean world. The drying up of what is now
the Sahara desert had pushed many peoples to the
south into sub-Sahara Africa. These peoples
settled at first in scattered hunting-and-gathering
bands, although in some places near lakes and
rivers, people who fished, with a more secure food
supply, lived in larger population concentrations.
Agriculture seems to have reached these people
from the Near East, since the first domesticated
crops were millets and sorghums whose origins are
not African but west Asian. Once the idea of
planting diffused, Africans began to develop their
own crops, such as certain varieties of rice, and
they demonstrated a continued receptiveness to
new imports. The proposed areas of the
domestication of African crops lie in a band that
extends from Ethiopia across southern Sudan to
West Africa. Subsequently, other crops, such as
bananas, were introduced from Southeast Asia.
Livestock also came from outside Africa. Cattle
were introduced from Asia, as probably were
domestic sheep and goats. Horses were apparently
introduced by the Hyksos invaders of Egypt (1780-
1560 B.C.) and then spread across the Sudan to
West Africa. Rock paintings in the Sahara indicate
that horses and chariots were used to traverse the
desert and that by 300-200 B.C., there were trade
routes across the Sahara. Horses were adopted by
peoples of the West African savannah, and later
their powerful cavalry forces allowed them to carve
out large empires. Finally, the camel was
introduced around the first century A.D. This was
an important innovation, because the camel’s
abilities to thrive in harsh desert conditions and to
carry large loads cheaply made it an effective and
efficient means of transportation. The camel
transformed the desert from a barrier into a still
difficult, but more accessible, route of trade and
communication.
Iron came from West Asia, although its routes of
diffusion were somewhat different than those of
agriculture. Most of Africa presents a curious case
in which societies moved directly from a technology
of stone to iron without passing through the
intermediate stage of copper or bronze metallurgy,
although some early copper-working sites have
been found in West Africa. Knowledge of iron
making penetrated into the forest and savannahs of
West Africa at roughly the same time that iron
making was reaching Europe. Evidence of iron
making has been found in Nigeria, Ghana, and
Mali.
This technological shift cause profound changes in
the complexity of African societies. Iron
represented power. In West Africa the blacksmith
who made tools and weapons had an important
place in society, often with special religious powers
and functions. Iron hoes, which made the land
more productive, and iron weapons, which made
the warrior more powerful, had symbolic meaning
in a number of West Africa societies. Those who
knew the secrets of making iron gained ritual and
sometimes political power.
Unlike in the Americas, where metallurgy was a
very late and limited development, Africans had
iron from a relatively early date, developing
ingenious furnaces to produce the high heat
needed for production and to control the amount of
air that reached the carbon and iron ore necessary
for making iron. Much of Africa moved right into the
Iron Age, taking the basic technology and adapting
it to local conditions and resources.
The diffusion of agriculture and later of iron was
accompanied by a great movement of people who
may have carried these innovations. These people
probably originated in eastern Nigeria. Their
migration may have been set in motion by an
increase in population caused by a movement of
peoples fleeing the desiccation, or drying up, of the
Sahara. They spoke a language, proto-Bantu
(“Bantu” means “the people”), which is the parent
tongue of a language of a large number of Bantu
languages still spoken throughout sub-Sahara
Africa. Why and how these people spread out into
central and southern Africa remains a mystery, but
archaeologists believe that their iron weapons
allowed them to conquer their hunting-gathering
opponents, who still used stone implements. Still,
the process is uncertain, and peaceful migration—
or simply rapid demographic growth—may have
also caused the Bantu explosion.
177
08 – 1 The Rise of Teotihuacán
The city of Teotihuacán, which lay about 50
kilometers northeast of modern-day Mexico City,
began its growth by 200-100 B.C. At its height,
between about A.D. 150 and 700, it probably had a
population of more than 125,000 people and
covered at least 20 square kilometers. It had over
2,000 apartment complexes, a great market, a
large number of industrial workshops, an
administrative center, a number of massive
religious edifices, and a regular grid pattern of
streets and buildings. Clearly, much planning and
central control were involved in the expansion and
ordering of this great metropolis. Moreover, the city
had economic and perhaps religious contacts with
most parts of Mesoamerica (modern Central
America and Mexico).
How did this tremendous development take place,
and why did it happen in the Teotihuacán Valley?
Among the main factors are Teotihuacán’s
geographic location on a natural trade route to the
south and east of the Valley of Mexico, the
obsidian resources in the Teotihuacán Valley itself,
and the valley’s potential for extensive irrigation.
The exact role of other factors is much more
difficult to pinpoint—for instance, Teotihuacán’s
religious significance as a shrine, the historical
situation in and around the Valley of Mexico toward
the end of the first millennium B.C., the ingenuity
and foresightedness of Teotihuacán’s elite, and,
finally, the impact of natural disasters, such as the
volcanic eruptions of the late first millennium B.C.
This last factor is at least circumstantially
implicated in Teotihuacán’s rise. Prior to 200 B.C.,
a number of relatively small centers coexisted in
and near the Valley of Mexico. Around this time,
the largest of these centers, Cuicuilco, was
seriously affected by a volcanic eruption, with much
of its agricultural land covered by lava. With
Cuicuilco eliminated as a potential rival, any one of
a number of relatively modest towns might have
emerged as a leading economic and political power
in Central Mexico. The archaeological evidence
clearly indicates, though, that Teotihuacán was the
center that did arise as the predominant force in
the area by the first century A.D.
It seems likely that Teotihuacán’s natural
resources, along with the city elite’s ability to
recognize their potential, gave the city a
competitive edge over its neighbors. The valley,
like many other places in Mexican and Guatemalan
highlands, was rich in obsidian. The hard volcanic
stone was a resource that had been in great
demand for many years, at least since the rise of
the Olmecs (a people who flourished between 1200
and 400 B.C.), and it apparently had a secure
market. Moreover, recent research on obsidian
tools found at Olmec sites has shown that some of
the obsidian obtained by the Olmecs originated
near Teotihuacán. Teotihuacán obsidian must have
been recognized as a valuable commodity for
many centuries before the great city arose.
Long-distance trade in obsidian probably gave the
elite residents of Teotihuacán access to a wide
variety of exotic good, as well as a relatively
prosperous life. Such success may have attracted
immigrants to Teotihuacán. In addition,
Teotihuacán’s elite may have consciously
attempted to attract new inhabitants. It is also
probable that as early as 200 B.C. Teotihuacán
may have achieved some religious significance and
its shrine (or shrines) may have served as an
additional population magnet. Finally, the growing
population was probably fed by increasing the
number and size of irrigated fields.
The picture of Teotihuacán that emerges is a
classic picture of positive feedback among obsidian
mining and working, trade, population growth,
irrigation, and religious tourism. The thriving
obsidian operation, for example, would necessitate
more miners, additional manufacturers of obsidian
tools, and additional traders to carry the goods to
new markets. All this led to increased wealth, which
in turn would attract more immigrants to
Teotihuacán. The growing power of the elite, who
controlled the economy, would give them the
means to physically coerce people to move to
Teotihuacán and serve as additions to the labor
force. More irrigation works would have to be built
to feed the growing population, and this resulted in
more power and wealth for the elite.
178
09 – 1 Colonizing the Americas via the
Northwest Coast
It has long been accepted that the Americas were
colonized by a migration of peoples from Asia,
slowly traveling across a land bridge called
Beringia (now the Bering Strait between
northeastern Asia and Alaska) during the last Ice
Age. The first water craft theory about this
migration was that around 11,000-12,000 years
ago there was an ice-free corridor stretching from
eastern Beringia to the areas of North America
south of the great northern glaciers. It was this
midcontinental corridor between two massive ice
sheets – the Laurentide to the east and the
Cordilleran to the west – that enabled the
southward migration. But belief in this ice-free
corridor began to crumble when paleoecologist
Glen MacDonald demonstrated that some of the
most important radiocarbon dates used to support
the existence of an ice-free corridor were incorrect.
He persuasively argued that such an ice-free
corridor did not exist until much later, when the
continental ice began its final retreat.
Support is growing for the alternative theory that
people using watercraft, possibly skin boats, moved
southward from Beringia along the Gulf of Alaska
and then southward along the Northwest coast of
North America possibly as early as 16,000 years
ago. This route would have enabled humans to
enter southern areas of the Americas prior to the
melting of the continental glaciers. Until the early
1970s,most archaeologists did not consider the
coast a possible migration route into the Americas
because geologists originally believed that during
the last Ice Age the entire Northwest Coast was
covered by glacial ice. It had been assumed that
the ice extended westward from the
Alaskan/Canadian Mountains to the very edge of
the continental shelf, the flat, submerged part of the
continent that extends into the ocean. This would
have created a barrier of ice extending from the
Alaska Peninsula, through the Gulf of Alaska and
southward along the Northwest Coast of north
America to what is today the state of Washington.
The most influential proponent of the coastal
migration route has been Canadian archaeologist
Knut Fladmark. He theorized that with the use of
watercraft, people gradually colonized unglaciated
refuges and areas along the continental shelf
exposed by the lower sea level. Fladmark’s
hypothesis received additional support form the
fact that the greatest diversity in native American
languages occurs along the west coast of the
Americas, suggesting that this region has been
settled the longest.
More recent geologic studies documented
deglaciation and the existence of ice-free areas
throughout major coastal areas of British Columbia,
Canada, by 13,000 years ago. Research now
indicates that sizable areas of southeastern Alaska
along the inner continental shelf were not covered
by ice toward the end of the last Ice Age. One
study suggests that except for a 250-mile coastal
area between southwestern British Columbia and
Washington State, the Northwest Coast of North
America was largely free of ice by approximately
16,000 years ago. Vast areas along the coast may
have been deglaciated beginning around 16,000
years ago, possibly providing a coastal corridor for
the movement of plants, animals, and humans
sometime between 13,000 and 14,000 years ago.
The coastal hypothesis has gained increasing
support in recent years because the remains of
large land animals, such as caribou and brown
bears, have been found in southeastern Alaska
dating between 10,000 and 12,500 years ago. This
is the time period in which most scientists formerly
believed the area to be inhospitable for humans. It
has been suggested that if the environment were
capable of supporting breeding populations of
bears, there would have been enough food
resources to support humans. Fladmark and other
believe that the first human colonization of America
occurred by boat along the Northwest Coast during
the very late Ice Age, possibly as early as 14,000
years ago. The most recent geologic evidence
indicates that it may have been possible for people
to colonize ice-free regions along the continental
shelf that were still exposed by the lower sea level
between13,000 and 14,000 years ago.
The coastal hypothesis suggests an economy
based on marine mammal hunting, saltwater
fishing, shellfish gathering, and the use of
watercraft. Because of the barrier of ice to the east,
the Pacific Ocean to the west, and populated areas
to the north, there may have been a greater
impetus for people to move in a southerly direction.

10 – 3 Seventeenth-Century European
Economic Growth
In the late sixteenth century and into the
seventeenth, Europe continued the growth that had
lifted it out of the relatively less prosperous
medieval period (from the mid 400s to the late
1400s). Among the key factors behind this growth
were increased agricultural productivity and an
expansion of trade.
Populations cannot grow unless the rural economy
can produce enough additional food to feed more
people. During the sixteenth century, farmers
brought more land into cultivation at the expense of
forests and fens (low-lying wetlands). Dutch land
reclamation in the Netherlands in the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries provides the most
spectacular example of the expansion of farmland:
the Dutch reclaimed more than 36.000 acres from
1590 to 1615 alone.
Much of the potential for European economic
development lay in what at first glance would seem
to have been only sleepy villages. Such villages,
however, generally lay in regions of relatively
advanced agricultural production, permitting not
only the survival of peasants but also the
accumulation of an agricultural surplus for
investment. They had access to urban merchants,
markets, and trade routes.
Increased agricultural production in turn facilitated
rural industry, an intrinsic part of the expansion of
industry. Woolens and textile manufacturers, in
particular, utilized rural cottage (in-home)
production, which took advantage of cheap and
plentiful rural labor. In the German states, the
ravages of the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648)
further moved textile production into the
countryside. Members of poor peasant families
spun or wove cloth and linens at home for scant
remuneration in an attempt to supplement meager
family income.
More extended trading networks also helped
develop Europe's economy in this period. English
and Dutch ships carrying rye from the Baltic states
reached Spain and Portugal. Population growth
generated an expansion of small-scale
manufacturing, particularly of handicrafts, textiles,
and metal production in England, Flanders, parts of
northern Italy, the southwestern German states,
and parts of Spain. Only iron smelting and mining
required marshaling a significant amount of capital
(wealth invested to create more wealth).
The development of banking and other financial
services contributed to the expansion of trade. By
the middle of the sixteenth century, financiers and
traders commonly accepted bills of exchange in
place of gold or silver for other goods. Bills of
exchange, which had their origins in medieval Italy,
were promissory notes (written promises to pay a
specified amount of money by a certain date) that
could be sold to third parties. In this way, they
provided credit. At mid-century, an Antwerp
financier only slightly exaggerated when he
claimed, "One can no more trade without bills of
exchange than sail without water." Merchants no
longer had to carry gold and silver over long,
dangerous journeys. An Amsterdam merchant
purchasing soap from a merchant in Marseille
could go to an exchanger and pay the exchanger
the equivalent sum in guilders, the Dutch currency.
The exchanger would then send a bill of exchange
to a colleague in Marseille, authorizing the
colleague to pay the Marseille merchant in the
merchant's own currency after the actual exchange
of goods had taken place.
Bills of exchange contributed to the development of
banks, as exchangers began to provide loans. Not
until the eighteenth century, however, did such
banks as the Bank of Amsterdam and the Bank of
England begin to provide capital for business
investment. Their principal function was to provide
funds for the state.
The rapid expansion in international trade also
benefitted from an infusion of capital, stemming
largely from gold and silver brought by Spanish
vessels from the Americas. This capital financed
the production of goods, storage, trade, and even
credit across Europe and overseas. Moreover, an
increased credit supply was generated by
investments and loans by bankers and wealthy
merchants to states and by joint-stock
partnerships—an English innovation (the first major
company began in 1600). Unlike short-term
financial cooperation between investors for a single
commercial undertaking, joint-stock companies
provided permanent funding of capital by drawing
on the investments of merchants and other
investors who purchased shares in the company.

14 – 2 Maya Water Problems
To understand the ancient Mayan people who lived
in the area that is today southern Mexico and
Central America and the ecological difficulties they
faced, one must first consider their environment,
which we think of as “jungle” or “tropical rainforest”.
This view is inaccurate, and the reason proves to
be important. Properly speaking, tropical rainforests
grow in high-rainfall equatorial areas that remain
wet or humid all year round. But the Maya
homeland lies more than sixteen hundred
kilometers from the equator, at latitudes 17 to 22
degrees north, in a habitat termed a “seasonal
tropical forest”. That is, while there does tend to be
a rainy season from May to October, there is also a
dry season from January through April. If one
focuses on the wet months, one calls the Maya
homeland a “seasonal tropical forest”; if one
focuses on the dry months, one could instead
describe it as a “seasonal desert”.
From north to south in the Yucatan Peninsula,
where the Maya lived, rainfall ranges from 18 to
100 inches (457 to 2,540 millimeters) per year, and
the soils become thicker, so that the southern
peninsula was agriculturally more productive and
supported denser populations. But rainfall in the
Maya homeland is unpredictably variable between
years; some recent years have had three or four
times more rain than other years. As a result,
modern farmers attempting to grow corn in the
ancient Maya homelands have faced frequent crop
failures, especially in the north. The ancient Maya
were presumably more experienced and did better,
but nevertheless they too must have faced risks of
crop failures from droughts and hurricanes.
Although southern Maya areas received more
rainfall than northern areas, problems of water
were paradoxically more severe in the wet south.
While that made things hard for ancient Maya living
in the south, it has also made things hard for
modern archaeologists who have difficulty
understanding why ancient droughts caused bigger
problems in the wet south than in the dry north.
The likely explanation is that an area of
underground freshwater underlies the Yucatan
Peninsula, but surface elevation increases from
north to south, so that as one moves south the land
surface lies increasingly higher above the water
table. In the northern peninsula the elevation is
sufficiently low that the ancient Maya were able to
reach the water table at deep sinkholes called
cenotes, or at deep caves. In low-elevation north
coastal areas without sinkholes, the Maya would
have been able to get down to the water table by
digging wells up to 75 feet (22 meters) deep. But
much of the south lies too high above the water
table for cenotes or wells to reach down to it.
Making matters worse, most of the Yucatan
Peninsula consists of karst, a porous sponge-like
limestone terrain where rain runs straight into the
ground and where little or no surface water remains
available.
How did those dense southern Maya populations
deal with the resulting water problem? It initially
surprises us that many of their cities were not built
next to the rivers but instead on high terrain in
rolling uplands. The explanation is that the Maya
excavated depressions, or modified natural
depressions, and then plugged up leaks in the
karst by plastering the bottoms of the depressions
in order to create reservoirs, which collected rain
from large plastered catchment basins and stored it
for use in the dry season. For example, reservoirs
at the Maya city of Tikal held enough water to meet
the drinking water needs of about 10,000 people
for a period of 18 months. At the city of Coba the
Maya built dikes around a lake in order to raise its
level and make their water supply more reliable.
But the inhabitants of Tikal and other cities
dependent on reservoirs for drinking water would
still have been in deep trouble if 18 months passed
without rain in a prolonged drought. A shorter
drought in which they exhausted their stored food
supplies might already have gotten them in deep
trouble, because growing crops required rain rather
than reservoirs.

14 – 3 Pastoralism in Ancient Inner Eurasia
Pastoralism is a lifestyle in which economic activity
is based primarily on livestock. Archaeological
evidence suggests that by 3000 B.C., and perhaps
even earlier, there had emerged on the steppes of
Inner Eurasia the distinctive types of pastoralism
that were to dominate the region’s history for
several millennia. Here, the horse was already
becoming the animal of prestige in many regions,
though sheep, goats, and cattle could also play a
vital role. It is the use of horses for transportation
and warfare that explains why Inner Eurasian
pastoralism proved the most mobile and the most
militaristic of all major forms of pastoralism. The
emergence and spread of pastoralism had a
profound impact on the history of Inner Eurasia,
and also, indirectly, on the parts of Asia and
Europe just outside this area. In particular,
pastoralism favors a mobile lifestyle, and this
mobility helps to explain the impact of pastoralist
societies on this part of the world.
The mobility of pastoralist societies reflects their
dependence on animal-based foods. While
agriculturalists rely on domesticated plants,
pastoralists rely on domesticated animals. As a
result, pastoralists, like carnivores in general,
occupy a higher position on the food chain. All else
being equal, this means they must exploit larger
areas of land than do agriculturalists to secure the
same amount of food, clothing, and other
necessities. So pastoralism is a more extensive
lifeway than farming is. However, the larger the
terrain used to support a group, the harder it is to
exploit that terrain while remaining in one place.
So, basic ecological principles imply a strong
tendency within pastoralist lifeways toward
nomadism (a mobile lifestyle). As the archaeologist
Roger Cribb puts it, “The greater the degree of
pastoralism, the stronger the tendency toward
nomadism.” A modern Turkic nomad interviewed by
Cribb commented: “The more animals you have,
the farther you have to move.”
Nomadism has further consequences. It means
that pastoralist societies occupy and can influence
very large territories. This is particularly true of the
horse pastoralism that emerged in the Inner
Eurasian steppes, for this was the most mobile of
all major forms of pastoralism. So, it is no accident
that with the appearance of pastoralist societies
there appear large areas that share similar cultural,
ecological, and even linguistic features. By the late
fourth millennium B.C., there is already evidence of
large culture zones reaching from Eastern Europe
to the western borders of Mongolia. Perhaps the
most striking sign of mobility is the fact that by the
third millennium B.C., most pastoralists in this huge
region spoke related languages ancestral to the
modern Indo-European languages. The remarkable
mobility and range of pastoral societies explain, in
part, why so many linguists have argued that the
Indo-European languages began their astonishing
expansionist career not among farmers in Anatolia
(present-day Turkey), but among early pastoralists
from Inner Eurasia. Such theories imply that the
Indo-European languages evolved not in Neolithic
(10,000 to 3,000 B.C.) Anatolia, but among the
foraging communities of the cultures in the region
of the Don and Dnieper rivers, which took up stock
breeding and began to exploit the neighboring
steppes.
Nomadism also subjects pastoralist communities to
strict rules of portability. If you are constantly on the
move, you cannot afford to accumulate large
material surpluses. Such rules limit variations in
accumulated material goods between pastoralist
households (though they may also encourage a
taste for portable goods of high value such as silks
or jewelry). So, by and large, nomadism implies a
high degree of self-sufficiency and inhibits the
appearance of an extensive division of labor.
Inequalities of wealth and rank certainly exist, and
have probably existed in most pastoralist societies,
but except in periods of military conquest, they are
normally too slight to generate the stable,
hereditary hierarchies that are usually implied by
the use of the term class. Inequalities of gender
have also existed in pastoralist societies, but they
seem to have been softened by the absence of
steep hierarchies of wealth in most communities,
and also by the requirement that women acquire
most of the skills of men, including, often, their
military skills.

05 – 2 The Origin of the Pacific Island People
The greater Pacific region, traditionally called
Oceania, consists of three cultural areas:
Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia. Melanesia,
in the southwest Pacific, contains the large islands
of New Guinea, the Solomons, Vanuatu, and New
Caledonia. Micronesia, the area north of
Melanesia, consists primarily of small scattered
islands. Polynesia is the central Pacific area in the
great triangle defined by Hawaii, Easter Island, and
New Zealand. Before the arrival of Europeans, the
islands in the two largest cultural areas, Polynesia
and Micronesia, together contained a population
estimated at 700,000.
Speculation on the origin of these Pacific islanders
began as soon as outsiders encountered them, in
the absence of solid linguistic, archaeological, and
biological data, many fanciful and mutually
exclusive theories were devised. Pacific islanders
are variously thought to have come from North
America, South America, Egypt, Israel, and India,
as well as Southeast Asia. Many older theories
implicitly deprecated the navigational abilities and
overall cultural creativity of the Pacific islanders.
For example, British anthropologists G. Elliot Smith
and W. J. Perry assumed that only Egyptians would
have been skilled enough to navigate and colonize
the Pacific. They inferred that the Egyptians even
crossed the Pacific to found the great civilizations
of the New World (North and South America). In
1947 Norwegian adventurer Thor Heyerdahl drifted
on a balsa-log raft westward with the winds and
currents across the Pacific from South America to
prove his theory that Pacific islanders were Native
Americans (also called American Indians). Later
Heyerdahl suggested that the Pacific was peopled
by three migrations: by Native Americans from the
Pacific Northwest of North America drifting to
Hawaii, by Peruvians drifting to Easter Island, and
by Melanesians. In 1969 he crossed the Atlantic in
an Egyptian-style reed boat to prove Egyptian
influences in the Americas. Contrary to these
theorists, the overwhelming evidence of physical
anthropology, linguistics, and archaeology shows
that the Pacific islanders came from Southeast Asia
and were skilled enough as navigators to sail
against the prevailing winds and currents.
The basic cultural requirements for the successful
colonization of the Pacific islands include the
appropriate boat-building, sailing, and navigation
skills to get to the islands in the first place,
domesticated plants and gardening skills suited to
often marginal conditions, and a varied inventory of
fishing implements and techniques. It is now
generally believed that these prerequisites
originated with peoples speaking Austronesian
languages (a group of several hundred related
languages) and began to emerge in Southeast Asia
by about 5,000 B.C.E. The culture of that time,
based on archaeology and linguistic reconstruction,
is assumed to have had a broad inventory of
cultivated plants including taro, yarns, banana,
sugarcane, breadfruit, coconut, sago, and rice. Just
as important, the culture also possessed the basic
foundation for an effective maritime adaptation,
including outrigger canoes and a variety of fishing
techniques that could be effective for overseas
voyaging.
Contrary to the arguments of some that much of
the pacific was settled by Polynesians accidentally
marooned after being lost and adrift, it seems
reasonable that this feat was accomplished by
deliberate colonization expeditions that set out fully
stocked with food and domesticated plants and
animals. Detailed studies of the winds and currents
using computer simulations suggest that drifting
canoes would have been a most unlikely means of
colonizing the Pacific. These expeditions were
likely driven by population growth and political
dynamics on the home islands, as well as the
challenge and excitement of exploring unknown
waters. Because all Polynesians, Micronesians,
and many Melanesians speak Austronesian
languages and grow crops derived from Southeast
Asia, all these peoples most certainly derived from
that region and not the New World or elsewhere.
The undisputed pre-Columbian presence in
Oceania of the sweet potato, which is a New World
domesticate, has sometimes been used to support
Heyerdahl's "American Indians in the Pacific"
theories. However, this is one plant out of a long
list of Southeast Asian domesticates. As Patrick
Kirch, an American anthropologist, points out,
rather than being brought by rafting South
Americans, sweet potatoes might just have easily
been brought back by returning Polynesian
navigators who could have reached the west coast
of South America.
183
06 – 2 William Smith
In 1769 in a little town in Oxfordshire, England, a
child with the very ordinary name of William Smith
was born into the poor family of a village
blacksmith. He received rudimentary village
schooling, but mostly he roamed his uncle's farm
collecting the fossils that were so abundant in the
rocks of the Cotswold hills. When he grew older,
William Smith taught himself surveying from books
he bought with his small savings, and at the age of
eighteen he was apprenticed to a surveyor of the
local parish. He then proceeded to teach himself
geology, and when he was twenty-four, he went to
work for the company that was excavating the
Somerset Coal Canal in the south of England.
This was before the steam locomotive, and canal
building was at its height. The companies building
the canals to transport coal needed surveyors to
help them find the coal deposits worth mining as
well as to determine the best courses for the
canals. This job gave Smith an opportunity to study
the fresh rock outcrops created by the newly dug
canal. He later worked on similar jobs across the
length and breadth of England, all the while
studying the newly revealed strata and collecting all
the fossils he could find. Smith used mail coaches
to travel as much as 10,000 miles per year. In 1815
he published the first modern geological map, “A
Map of the Strata of England and Wales with a Part
of Scotland,” a map so meticulously researched
that it can still be used today.
In 1831 when Smith was finally recognized by the
Geological Society of London as the “father of
English geology,” it was not only for his maps but
also for something even more important. Ever since
people had begun to catalog the strata in particular
outcrops, there had been the hope that these could
somehow be used to calculate geological time. But
as more and more accumulations of strata were
cataloged in more and more places, it became
clear that the sequences of rocks sometimes
differed from region to region and that no rock type
was ever going to become a reliable time marker
throughout the world. Even without the problem of
regional differences, rocks present a difficulty as
unique time markers. Quartz is quartz—a silicon
ion surrounded by four oxygen ions—there’s no
difference at all between two-million-year-old
Pleistocene quartz and Cambrian quartz created
over 500 million years ago.
As he collected fossils from strata throughout
England, Smith began to see that the fossils told a
different story from the rocks. Particularly in the
younger strata, the rocks were often so similar that
he had trouble distinguishing the strata, but he
never had trouble telling the fossils apart. While
rock between two consistent strata might in one
place be shale and in another sandstone, the
fossils in that shale or sandstone were always the
same. Some fossils endured through so many
millions of years that they appear in many strata,
but others occur only in a few strata, and a few
species had their births and extinctions within one
particular stratum. Fossils are thus identifying
markers for particular periods in Earth's history.
Not only could Smith identify rock strata by the
fossils they contained, he could also see a pattern
emerging: certain fossils always appear in more
ancient sediments, while others begin to be seen
as the strata become more recent. By following the
fossils, Smith was able to put all the strata of
England's earth into relative temporal sequence.
About the same time, Georges Cuvier made the
same discovery while studying the rocks around
Paris. Soon it was realized that this principle of
faunal (animal) succession was valid not only in
England or France but virtually everywhere. It was
actually a principle of floral succession as well,
because plants showed the same transformation
through time as did fauna. Limestone may be found
in the Cambrian or—300 million years later—in the
Jurassic strata, but a trilobite—the ubiquitous
marine arthropod that had its birth in the
Cambrian—will never be found in Jurassic strata,
nor a dinosaur in the Cambrian.

16 – 1 Trade and the Ancient Middle East
Trade was the mainstay of the urban economy in
the Middle East, as caravans negotiated the
surrounding desert, restricted only by access to
water and by mountain ranges. This has been so
since ancient times, partly due to the geology of the
area, which is mostly limestone and sandstone,
with few deposits of metallic ore and other useful
materials. Ancient demands for obsidian (a black
volcanic rock useful for making mirrors and tools)
led to trade with Armenia to the north, while jade
for cutting tools was brought from Turkistan, and
the precious stone lapis lazuli was imported from
Afghanistan. One can trace such expeditions back
to ancient Sumeria, the earliest known Middle
Eastern civilization. Records show merchant
caravans and trading posts were set up by the
Sumerians in the surrounding mountains and
deserts of Persia and Arabia, where they traded
grain for raw materials, such as timber and stones,
as well as for metals and gems.
Reliance on trade had several important
consequences. Production was generally in the
hands of skilled individual artisans doing piecework
under the tutelage of a master who was also the
shop owner. In these shops differences of rank
were blurred as artisans and masters labored side
by side in the same modest establishment, were
usually members of the same guild and religious
sect, lived in the same neighborhoods, and often
had assumed (or real) kinship relationships. The
worker was bound to the master by a mutual
contract that either one could repudiate, and the
relationship was conceptualized as one of
partnership.
This mode of craft production favored the growth of
self-governing and ideologically egalitarian craft
guilds everywhere in the Middle Eastern city. These
were essentially professional associations that
provided for the mutual aid and protection of their
members, and allowed for the maintenance of
professional standards. The growth of independent
guilds was furthered by the fact that surplus was
not a result of domestic craft production but
resulted primarily from international trading; the
government left working people to govern
themselves, much as shepherds of tribal
confederacies were left alone by their leaders. In
the multiplicity of small-scale local egalitarian or
quasi-egalitarian organizations for fellowship,
worship, and production that flourished in this
laissez-faire environment, individuals could interact
with one another within a community of harmony
and ideological equality, following their own
popularly elected leaders and governing
themselves by shared consensus while minimizing
distinctions of wealth and power.
The mercantile economy was also characterized by
a peculiar moral stance that is typical of people
who live by trade-an attitude that is individualistic,
calculating, risk taking, and adaptive to
circumstances. As among tribespeople, personal
relationships and a careful weighing of character
have always been crucial in a mercantile economy
with little regulation, where one's word is one's
bond and where informal ties of trust cement
together an international trade network. Nor have
merchants and artisans ever had much tolerance
for aristocratic professions of moral superiority,
favoring instead an egalitarian ethic of the open
market, where steady hard work, the loyalty of
one's fellows, and entrepreneurial skill make all the
difference. And, like the pastoralists, Middle
Eastern merchants and artisans unhappy with their
environment could simply pack up and leave for
greener pastures-an act of self-assertion wholly
impossible in most other civilizations throughout
history.
Dependence on long-distance trade also meant
that the great empires of the Middle East were built
both literally and figuratively on shifting sand. The
central state, though often very rich and very
populous, was intrinsically fragile, since the
development of new international trade routes
could undermine the monetary base and erode
state power, as occurred when European seafarers
circumvented Middle Eastern merchants after
Vasco da Gama's voyage around Africa in the late
fifteenth century opened up a southern route. The
ecology of the region also permitted armed
predators to prowl the surrounding barrens, which
were almost impossible for a state to control.
Peripheral peoples therefore had a great
advantage in their dealings with the center, making
government authority insecure and anxious.
185
17 – 1 Europe’s Early Sea Trade with Asia
In the fourteenth century, a number of political
developments cut Europe's overland trade routes
to southern and eastern Asia, with which Europe
had had important and highly profitable commercial
ties since the twelfth century. This development,
coming as it did when the bottom had fallen out of
the European economy, provided an impetus to a
long-held desire to secure direct relations with the
East by establishing a sea trade. Widely reported, if
somewhat distrusted, accounts by figures like the
famous traveler from Venice, Marco Polo, of the
willingness of people in China to trade with
Europeans and of the immensity of the wealth to be
gained by such contact made the idea irresistible.
Possibilities for trade seemed promising, but no
hope existed for maintaining the traditional routes
over land. A new way had to be found.
The chief problem was technological: How were the
Europeans to reach the East? Europe's maritime
tradition had developed in the context of easily
navigable seas—the Mediterranean, the Baltic,
and, to a lesser extent, the North Sea between
England and the Continent—not of vast oceans.
New types of ships were needed, new methods of
finding one's way, new techniques for financing so
vast a scheme. The sheer scale of the investment it
took to begin commercial expansion at sea reflects
the immensity of the profits that such East-West
trade could create. Spices were the most soughtafter commodities. Spices not only dramatically
improved the taste of the European diet but also
were used to manufacture perfumes and certain
medicines. But even high-priced commodities like
spices had to be transported in large bulk in order
to justify the expense and trouble of sailing around
the African continent all the way to India and China.
The principal seagoing ship used throughout the
Middle Ages was the galley, a long, low ship fitted
with sails but driven primarily by oars. The largest
galleys had as many as 50 oarsmen. Since they
had relatively shallow hulls, they were unstable
when driven by sail or when on rough water: hence
they were unsuitable for the voyage to the East.
Even if they hugged the African coastline, they had
little chance of surviving a crossing of the Indian
Ocean. Shortly after 1400, shipbuilders began
developing a new type of vessel properly designed
to operate in rough, open water: the caravel. It had
a wider and deeper hull than the galley and hence
could carry more cargo. Increased stability made it
possible to add multiple masts and sails. In the
largest caravels, two main masts held large square
sails that provided the bulk of the thrust driving the
ship forward, while a smaller forward mast held a
triangular-shaped sail, called a lateen sail, which
could be moved into a variety of positions to
maneuver the ship.
The astrolabe had long been the primary
instrument for navigation, having been introduced
in the eleventh century. It operated by measuring
the height of the Sun and the fixed stars: by
calculating the angles created by these points, it
determined the degree of latitude at which one
stood (the problem of determining longitude,
though, was not solved until the eighteenth
century). By the early thirteenth century, Western
Europeans had also developed and put into use
the magnetic compass, which helped when clouds
obliterated both the Sun and the stars. Also
beginning in the thirteenth century, there were new
maps refined by precise calculations and the
reports of sailors that made it possible to trace
one's path with reasonable accuracy. Certain
institutional and practical norms had become
established as well. A maritime code known as the
Consulate of the Sea, which originated in the
western Mediterranean region in the fourteenth
century, won acceptance by a majority of sea goers
as the normative code for maritime conduct; it
defined such matters as the authority of a ship's
officers, protocols of command, pay structures, the
rights of sailors, and the rules of engagement when
ships met one another on the sea-lanes. Thus by
about 1400 the key elements were in place to
enable Europe to begin its seaward adventure.
186
19 – 1 The Roman Army's Impact on Britain
In the wake of the Roman Empire's conquest of
Britain in the first century A.D., a large number of
troops stayed in the new province, and these
troops had a considerable impact on Britain with
their camps, fortifications, and participation in the
local economy.Assessing the impact of the army on
the civilian population starts from the realization
that the soldiers were always unevenly distributed
across the country. Areas rapidly incorporated into
the empire were not long affected by the military.
Where the army remained stationed, its presence
was much more influential. The imposition of a
military base involved the requisition of native lands
for both the fort and the territory needed to feed
and exercise the soldiers' animals. The imposition
of military rule also robbed local leaders of
opportunities to participate in local government, so
social development was stunted and the seeds of
disaffection sown. This then meant that the military
had to remain to suppress rebellion and organize
government.
Economic exchange was clearly very important as
the Roman army brought with it very substantial
spending power. Locally with respect to a particular
place or situation, a fort had two kinds of impact. Its
large population needed food and other supplies.
Some of these were certainly brought from long
distances, but demands were inevitably placed on
the local area. Although goods could be
requisitioned, they were usually paid for, and this
probably stimulated changes in the local economy.
When not campaigning, soldiers needed to be
occupied; otherwise they represented a potentially
dangerous source of friction and disloyalty. Hence
a writing tablet dated 25 April tells of 343 men at
one fort engaged on tasks like shoemaking,
building a bathhouse, operating kilns, digging clay,
and working lead. Such activities had a major effect
on the local area, in particular with the construction
of infrastructure such as roads, which improved
access to remote areas.
Each soldier received his pay, but in regions
without a developed economy there was initially
little on which it could be spent. The pool of excess
cash rapidly stimulated a thriving economy outside
fort gates. Some of the demand for the services
and goods was no doubt fulfilled by people drawn
from far afield, but some local people certainly
became entwined in this new economy. There was
informal marriage with soldiers, who until AD 197
were not legally entitled to wed, and whole new
communities grew up near the forts. These
settlements acted like small towns, becoming
centers for the artisan and trading populations.
The army also provided a mean of personal
advancement for auxiliary soldiers recruited from
the native peoples, as a man obtained hereditary
Roman citizenship on retirement after service in an
auxiliary regiment. Such units recruited on an ad
hoc (as needed) basis from the area in which they
were stationed, and there was evidently large-scale
recruitment within Britain. The total numbers were
at least 12,500 men up to the reign of the emperor
Hadrian (A.D. 117-138), with a peak around A.D.
80. Although a small proportion of the total
population, this perhaps had a massive local
impact when a large proportion of the young men
were removed from an area. Newly raised
regiments were normally transferred to another
province from whence it was unlikely that individual
recruits would ever return. Most units raised in
Britain went elsewhere on the European continent,
although one is recorded in Morocco. The reverse
process brought young men to Britain, where many
continued to live after their 20 to 25 years of
service, and this added to the cosmopolitan Roman
character of the frontier population. By the later
Roman period, frontier garrisons (groups of
soldiers) were only rarely transferred, service in
units became effectively hereditary, and forts were
no longer populated or maintained at full strength.
This process of settling in as a community over
several generations, combined with local
recruitment, presumably accounts for the apparent
stability of the British northern frontier in the later
Roman period. It also explains why some of the
forts continued in occupation long after Rome
ceased to have any formal authority in Britain, at
the beginning of the fifth century A.D. The
circumstances that had allowed natives to become
Romanized also led the self-sustaining military
community of the frontier area to become
effectively British.
187
20 – 1 Westward Migration
The story of the westward movement of population
in the United States is, in the main, the story of the
expansion of American agriculture — of the
development of new areas for the raising of
livestock and the cultivation of wheat, corn,
tobacco, and cotton. After 1815 improved
transportation enabled more and more western
farmers to escape a self-sufficient way of life and
enter a national market economy. During periods
when commodity prices were high, the rate of
westward migration increased spectacularly. "Old
America seemed to be breaking up and moving
westward," observed an English visitor in 1817,
during the first great wave of migration. Emigration
to the West reached a peak in the 1830's. Whereas
in 1810 only a seventh of the American people
lived west of the Appalachian Mountains, by 1840
more than a third lived there.
Why were these hundreds of thousands of settlers
— most of them farmers, some of them artisans —
drawn away from the cleared fields and established
cities and villages of the East? Certain
characteristics of American society help to explain
this remarkable migration. The European ancestors
of some Americans had for centuries lived rooted to
the same village or piece of land until some
religious, political, or economic crisis uprooted
them and drove them across the Atlantic. Many of
those who experienced this sharp break thereafter
lacked the ties that had bound them and their
ancestors to a single place. Moreover, European
society was relatively stratified; occupation and
social status were inherited. In American society,
however, the class structure was less rigid; some
people changed occupations easily and believed it
was their duty to improve their social and economic
position. As a result, many Americans were an
inveterately restless, rootless, and ambitious
people. Therefore, these social traits helped to
produce the nomadic and daring settlers who kept
pushing westward beyond the fringes of settlement.
In addition, there were other immigrants who
migrated west in search of new homes, material
success, and better lives.
The West had plenty of attractions: the alluvial river
bottoms, the fecund soils of the rolling forest lands,
the black loams of the prairies were tempting to
New England farmers working their rocky, sterile
land and to southeastern farmers plagued with soil
depletion and erosion. In 1820 under a new land
law, a farm could be bought for $100. The
continued proliferation of banks made it easier for
those without cash to negotiate loans in paper
money. Western Farmers borrowed with the
confident expectation that the expanding economy
would keep farm prices high, thus making it easy to
repay loans when they fell due.
Transportation was becoming less of a problem for
those who wished to move west and for those who
hand farm surpluses to send to market. Prior to
1815, western farmers who did not live on
navigable waterways were connected to them only
by dirt roads and mountain trails. Livestock could
be driven across the mountains, but the cost of
transporting bulky grains in this fashion was several
times greater than their value in eastern markets.
The first step toward an improvement of western
transportation was the construction of turnpikes.
These roads made possible a reduction in
transportation costs and thus stimulated the
commercialization of agriculture along their routes.
Two other developments presaged the end of the
era of turnpikes and started a transportation
revolution that resulted in increased regional
specialization and the growth of a national market
economy. First came the steamboat; although
flatboats and keelboats continued to be important
until the 1850’s steamboats eventually superseded
all other craft in the carrying of passengers and
freight. Steamboats were not only faster but also
transported upriver freight for about one tenth of
what it had previously cost on hand-propelled
keelboats. Next came the Erie Canal, an enormous
project in its day, spanning about 350 miles. After
the canal went into operation, the cost per mile of
transporting a ton of freight from Buffalo to New
York City declined from nearly 20 cents to less than
1 cent. Eventually, the western states diverted
much of their produce from the rivers to the Erie
Canal, a shorter route to eastern markets.
188
20 – 2 Early Settlements in the Southwest Asia
The universal global warming at the end of the Ice
Age had dramatic effects on temperate regions of
Asia, Europe, and North America. Ice sheets
retreated and sea levels rose. The climatic changes
in southwestern Asia were more subtle, in that they
involved shifts in mountain snow lines, rainfall
patterns, and vegetation cover. However, these
same cycles of change had momentous impacts on
the sparse human populations of the region. At the
end of the Ice Age, no more than a few thousand
foragers lived along the eastern Mediterranean
coast, in the Jordan and Euphrates valleys. Within
2,000 years, the human population of the region
numbered in the tens of thousands, all as a result
of village life and farming. Thanks to new
environmental and archaeological discoveries, we
now know something about this remarkable change
in local life.
Pollen samples from freshwater lakes in Syria and
elsewhere tell us forest cover expanded rapidly at
the end of the Ice Age, for the southwestern Asian
climate was still cooler and considerably wetter
than today. Many areas were richer in animal and
plant species than they are now, making them
highly favorable for human occupation. About 9000
B.C., most human settlements lay in the area along
the Mediterranean coast and in the Zagros
Mountains of Iran and their foothills. Some local
areas, like the Jordan River valley, the middle
Euphrates valley, and some Zagros valleys, were
more densely populated than elsewhere. Here
more sedentary and more complex societies
flourished. These people exploited the landscape
intensively, foraging on hill slopes for wild cereal
grasses and nuts, while hunting gazelle and other
game on grassy lowlands and in river valleys. Their
settlements contain exotic objects such as
seashells, stone bowls, and artifacts made of
obsidian (volcanic glass), all traded from afar. This
considerable volume of intercommunity exchange
brought a degree of social complexity in its wake.
Thanks to extremely fine-grained excavation and
extensive use of flotation methods (through which
seeds are recovered from soil samples), we know a
great deal about the foraging practices of the
inhabitants of Abu Hureyra in Syria's Euphrates
valley. Abu Hureyra was founded about 9500 B.C.,
a small village settlement of cramped pit dwellings
(houses dug partially in the soil) with reed roofs
supported by wooden uprights. For the next 1,500
years, its inhabitants enjoyed a somewhat warmer
and damper climate than today, living in a wellwooded steppe area where wild cereal grasses
were abundant. They subsisted offspring
migrations of Persian gazelles from the south. With
such a favorable location, about 300 to 400 people
lived in a sizable, permanent settlement. They were
no longer a series of small bands but lived in a
large community with more elaborate social
organization, probably grouped into clans of people
of common descent.
The flotation samples from the excavations allowed
botanists to study shifts in plant-collecting habits as
if they were looking through a telescope at a
changing landscape. Hundreds of tiny plant
remains show how the inhabitants exploited nut
harvests in nearby pistachio and oak forests.
However, as the climate dried up, the forests
retreated from the vicinity of the settlement. The
inhabitants turned to wild cereal grasses instead,
collecting them by the thousands, while the
percentage of nuts in the diet fell. By 8200 B.C.,
drought conditions were so severe that the people
abandoned their long-established settlement,
perhaps dispersing into smaller camps.
Five centuries later, about 7700 B.C., a new village
rose on the mound. At first the inhabitants still
hunted gazelle intensively. Then, about 7000 B.C.,
within the space of a few generations, they
switched abruptly to herding domesticated goats
and sheep and to growing einkorn, pulses, and
other cereal grasses. Abu Hureyra grew rapidly
until it covered nearly 30 acres. It was a close-knit
community of rectangular, one-story mud-brick
houses, joined by narrow lanes and courtyards,
finally abandoned about 5000 B.C.. Many complex
factors led to the adoption of the new economies,
not only at Abu Hureyra, but at many other
locations such as 'Ain Ghazal, also in Syria, where
goat toe bones showing the telltale marks of
abrasion caused by foot tethering (binding) testify
to early herding of domestic stock.

25 – 2 The Decline of Venetian Shipping
In the late thirteenth century, northern Italian cities
such as Genoa, Florence, and Venice began an
economic resurgence that made them into the most
important economic centers of Europe. By the
seventeenth century, however, other European
powers had taken over, as the Italian cities lost
much of their economic might.
This decline can be seen clearly in the changes
that affected Venetian shipping and trade. First,
Venice's intermediary functions in the Adriatic Sea,
where it had dominated the business of shipping
for other parties, were lost to direct trading. In the
fifteenth century there was little problem recruiting
sailors to row the galleys (large ships propelled by
oars): guilds (business associations) were required
to provide rowers, and through a draft system free
citizens served compulsorily when called for. In the
early sixteenth century the shortage of rowers was
not serious because the demand for galleys was
limited by a move to round ships (round-hulled
ships with more cargo space), with required fewer
rowers. But the shortage of crews proved to be a
greater and greater problem, despite continuous
appeal to Venice's tradition of maritime greatness.
Even though sailors' wages doubled among the
northern Italian cities from 1550 to 1590, this did
not elicit an increased supply.
The problem in shipping extended to the Arsenale,
Venice's huge and powerful shipyard. Timber ran
short, and it was necessary to procure it from
farther and farther away. In ancient Roman times,
the Italian peninsula had great forest of fir preferred
for warships, but scarcity was apparent as early as
the early fourteenth century. Arsenale officers first
brought timber from the foothills of the Alps, then
from north toward Trieste, and finally from across
the Adriatic. Private shipbuilders were required to
buy their oak abroad. As the costs of shipbuilding
rose, Venice clung to its outdated standard while
the Dutch were innovation in the lighter and more
easily handled ships.
The step from buying foreign timber to buying
foreign ships was regarded as a short one,
especially when complaints were heard in the latter
sixteenth century that the standards and traditions
of the Arsenale were running down. Work was
stretched out and done poorly. Older workers had
been allowed to stop work a half hour before the
regular time, and in 1601 younger works left with
them. Merchants complained that the privileges
reserved for Venetian-built and owned ships were
first extended to those Venetians who bought ships
from abroad and then to foreign-built and owned
vessels. Historian Frederic Lane observes that after
the loss of ships in battle in the late sixteenth
century, the shipbuilding industry no longer had the
capacity to recover that it had displayed at the start
of the century.
The conventional explanation for the loss of
Venetian dominance in trade is establishment of
the Portuguese direct sea route to the East,
replacing the overland Silk Road from the Black
Sea and the highly profitable Indian Oceancaravan-eastern Mediterranean route to Venice.
The Portuguese Vasco da Gama's Voyage around
southern Africa to India took place at the end of the
fifteenth century, and by 1502 the trans- Abrabian
caravan route had been cut off by political unrest.
The Venetian Council finally allowed round ships to
enter the trade that was previously reserved for
merchant galleys, thus reducing transport cost by
one third. Prices of spices delivered by ship from
the eastern Mediterranean came to equal those of
spices transported by Paortuguese vessels, but the
increase in quantity with both routes in operation
drove the price far down. Gradually, Venice's role
as a storage and distribution center for spices and
silk, dyes cotton, and gold decayed, and by the
early seventeenth century Venice had lost its
monopoly in markets such as France and southern
Germany.
Venetian shipping had started to decline from
about 1530-before the entry into the Mediterranean
of large volumes of Dutch and British shipping-and
was clearly outclassed by the end of the century. A
contemporary of Shakespeare (1564-1616)
observed that the productivity of Italian shipping
had declined, compared with that of the British,
because of conservatism and loss of expertise.
Moreover, Italian sailors were deserting and
emigrating, and captains, no longer recruited from
the ranks of nobles, were weak on navigations.

26 – 3 Sumer and the First Cities of the Ancient
Near East
The earliest of the city states of the ancient Near
East appeared at the southern end of the
Mesopotamian plain, the area between the Tigris
and Euphrates rivers in what is now Iraq. It was
here that the civilization known as Sumer emerged
in its earliest form in the fifth millennium. At first
sight, the plain did not appear to be a likely home
for a civilization. There were few natural resources,
no timber, stone, or metals. Rainfall was limited,
and what water there was rushed across the plain
in the annual flood of melted snow. As the plain fell
only 20 meters in 500 kilometers, the beds of the
rivers shifted constantly. It was this that made the
organization of irrigation, particularly the building of
canals to channel and preserve the water,
essential. Once this was done and the silt carried
down by the rivers was planted, the rewards were
rich: four to five times what rain-fed earth would
produce. It was these conditions that allowed an
elite to emerge, probably as an organizing class,
and to sustain itself through the control of surplus
crops.
It is difficult to isolate the factors that led to the next
development — the emergence of urban
settlements. The earliest, that of Eridu, about 4500
B.C.E., and Uruk, a thousand years later, center on
impressive temple complexes built of mud brick. In
some way, the elite had associated themselves
with the power of the gods. Uruk, for instance, had
two patron gods — Anu, the god of the sky and
sovereign of all other gods, and Inanna, a goddess
of love and war — and there were others, patrons
of different cities. Human beings were at their
mercy. The biblical story of the Flood may originate
in Sumer. In the earliest version, the gods destroy
the human race because its clamor had been so
disturbing to them.
It used to be believed that before 3000 B.C.E. the
political and economic life of the cities was
centered on their temples, but it now seems
probable that the cities had secular rulers from
earliest times. Within the city lived administrators,
craftspeople, and merchants. (Trading was
important, as so many raw materials, the
semiprecious stones for the decoration of the
temples, timbers for roofs, and all metals, had to be
imported.) An increasingly sophisticated system of
administration led in about 3300 B.C.E. to the
appearance of writing. The earliest script was
based on logograms, with a symbol being used to
express a whole word. The logograms were incised
on damp clay tablets with a stylus with a wedge
shape at its end. (The Romans called the shape
cuneus and this gives the script its name of
cuneiform.) Two thousand logograms have been
recorded from these early centuries of writing. A
more economical approach was to use a sign to
express not a whole word but a single syllable. (To
take an example: the Sumerian word for “head”
was “sag.” Whenever a word including a syllable in
which the sound “sag” was to be written, the sign
for “sag" could be used to express that syllable with
the remaining syllables of the word expressed by
other signs.) By 2300 B.C.E. the number of signs
required had been reduced to 600, and the range
of words that could be expressed had widened.
Texts dealing with economic matters predominated,
as they always had done; but at this point works of
theology, literature, history, and law also appeared.
Other innovations of the late fourth millennium
include the wheel, probably developed first as a
more efficient way of making pottery and then
transferred to transport. A tablet engraved about
3000 B.C.E. provides the earliest known example
from Sumer, a roofed boxlike sledge mounted on
four solid wheels. A major development was the
discovery, again about 3000 B.C.E., that if copper,
which had been known in Mesopotamia since
about 3500 B.C.E., was mixed with tin, a much
harder metal, bronze, would result. Although
copper and stone tools continued to be used,
bronze was far more successful in creating sharp
edges that could be used as anything from saws
and scythes to weapons. The period from 3000 to
1000 B.C.E., when the use of bronze became
widespread, is normally referred to as the Bronze
Age.
191
28 – 2 Early Saharan Pastoralists
The Sahara is a highly diverse, albeit dry, region
that has undergone major climatic changes since
10,000 B.C. As recently as 6,000 B.C., the
southern frontier of the desert was far to the north
of where it is now, while semiarid grassland and
shallow freshwater lakes covered much of what are
now arid plains. This was a landscape where
antelope of all kinds abounded — along with
Bosprimigenius, a kind of oxen that has become
extinct. The areas that are now desert were, like all
arid regions, very susceptible to cycles of higher
and lower levels of rainfall, resulting in major,
sudden changes in distributions of plants and
animals. The people who hunted the sparse desert
animals responded to drought by managing the
wild resources they hunted and gathered,
especially wild oxen, which had to have regular
water supplies to survive.
Even before the drought, the Sahara was never
well watered. Both humans and animals were
constantly on the move, in search of food and
reliable water supplies. Under these circumstances,
archaeologist Andrew Smith believes, the small
herds of Bosprimigenius in the desert became
smaller, more closely knit breeding units as the
drought took hold. The beasts were more
disciplined, so that it was easier for hunters to
predict their habits, and capture animals at will. At
the same time, both cattle and humans were more
confined in their movements, staying much closer
to permanent water supplies for long periods of
time. As a result, cattle and humans came into
close association.
Smith believes that the hunters were well aware of
the more disciplined ways in which their prey
behaved. Instead of following the cattle on their
annual migrations, the hunters began to prevent
the herd from moving from one spot to another. At
first, they controlled the movement of the herd
while ensuring continuance of their meat diet. But
soon they also gained genetic control of the
animals, which led to rapid physical changes in the
herd. South African farmers who maintain herds of
wild eland (large African antelopes with short,
twisted horns) report that the offspring soon
diminish in size, unless wild bulls are introduced
constantly from outside. The same effects of
inbreeding may have occurred in controlled cattle
populations, with some additional, and perhaps
unrecognized, advantages. The newly
domesticated animals behaved better, were easier
to control, and may have enjoyed a higher birth
rate, which in turn yielded greater milk supplies. We
know from rock paintings deep in the Sahara that
the herders were soon selecting breeding animals
to produce offspring with different horn shapes and
hide colors.
It is still unclear whether domesticated cattle were
tamed independently in northern Africa or
introduced to the continent from Southwest Asia.
Whatever the source of the original tamed herds
might have been, it seems entirely likely that much
the same process of juxtaposition (living side by
side) and control occurred in both southwest Asia
and northern Africa, and even in Europe, among
peoples who had an intimate knowledge of the
behavior of wild cattle. The experiments with
domestication probably occurred in many places,
as people living in ever-drier environments cast
around for more predictable food supplies.
The cattle herders had only a few possessions:
unsophisticated pots and polished adzes. They
also hunted with bow and arrow. The Saharan
people left a remarkable record of their lives
painted on the walls of caves deep in the desert.
Their artistic endeavors have been preserved in
paintings of wild animals, cattle, goats, humans,
and scenes of daily life that extend back perhaps to
5,000 B.C.. The widespread distribution of pastoral
sites of this period suggests that the Saharans
ranged their herds over widely separated summer
and winter grazing grounds.
About 3,500 B.C., climatic conditions again
deteriorated. The Sahara slowly became drier and
lakes vanished. On the other hand, rainfall
increased in the interior of western Africa, and the
northern limit of the tsetse fly, an insect fatal to
cattle, moved south. So the herders shifted south,
following the major river systems into savanna
regions. By this time, the Saharan people were
probably using domestic crops, experimenting with
such summer rainfall crops as sorghum and millet
as they move out of areas where they could grow
wheat, barley, and other Mediterranean crops.
192
32 – 2 Siam, 1851-1910
In the late nineteenth century, political and social
changes were occurring rapidly in Siam (now
Thailand). The old ruling families were being
displaced by an evolving centralized government.
These families were pensioned off (given a sum of
money to live on) or simply had their revenues
taken away or restricted; their sons were enticed
away to schools for district officers, later to be
posted in some faraway province; and the old
patron-client relations that had bound together local
societies simply disintegrated. Local rulers could no
longer protect their relatives and attendants in legal
cases, and with the ending in 1905 of the practice
of forcing peasant farmers to work part-time for
local rulers, the rulers no longer had a regular base
for relations with rural populations. The old local
ruling families, then, were severed from their
traditional social context.
The same situation viewed from the perspective of
the rural population is even more complex.
According to the government’s first census of the
rural population, taken in 1905, there were about
thirty thousand villages in Siam. This was probably
a large increase over the figure even two or three
decades earlier, during the late 1800s. It is difficult
to imagine it now, but Siam’s Central Plain in the
late 1800s was nowhere near as densely settled as
it is today. There were still forests closely
surrounding Bangkok into the last half of the
nineteenth century, and even at century’s end there
were wild elephants and tigers roaming the
countryside only twenty or thirty miles away.
Much population movement involved the opening
up of new lands for rice cultivation. Two things
made this possible and encouraged it to happen.
First, the opening of the kingdom to the full force of
international trade by the Bowring Treaty (1855)
rapidly encouraged economic specialization in the
growing of rice, mainly to feed the rice-deficient
portions of Asia (India and China in particular). The
average annual volume of rice exported from Siam
grew from under 60 million kilograms per year in
the late 1850s to more than 660 million kilograms
per year at the turn of the century; and over the
same period the average price per kilogram
doubled. During the same period, the area planted
in rice increased from about 230, 000 acres to
more than 350, 000 acres. This growth was
achieved as the result of the collective decisions of
thousands of peasant families to expand the
amount of land they cultivated, clear and plant new
land, or adopt more intensive methods of
agriculture.
They were able to do so because of our second
consideration. They were relatively freer than they
had been half a century earlier. Over the course of
the Fifth Reign (1868 – 1910), the ties that bound
rural people to the aristocracy and local ruling elites
were greatly reduced. Peasants now paid a tax on
individuals instead of being required to render labor
service to the government. Under these conditions,
it made good sense to thousands of peasant
families to in effect work full-time at what they had
been able to do only part-time previously because
of the requirement to work for the government:
grow rice for the marketplace.
Numerous changes accompanied these
developments. The rural population both dispersed
and grew, and was probably less homogeneous
and more mobile than it had been a generation
earlier. The villages became more vulnerable to
arbitrary treatment by government bureaucrats as
local elites now had less control over them. By the
early twentieth century, as government
modernization in a sense caught up with what had
been happening in the countryside since the
1870s, the government bureaucracy intruded more
and more into village life. Provincial police began to
appear, along with district officers and cattle
registration and land deeds and registration for
compulsory military service. Village handicrafts
diminished or died out completely as people bought
imported consumer goods, like cloth and tools,
instead of making them themselves. More
economic variation took shape in rural villages, as
some grew prosperous from farming while others
did not. As well as can be measured, rural
standards of living improved in the Fifth Reign. But
the statistical averages mean little when measured
against the harsh realities of peasant life.
193
33 – 1 The First Civilizations
Evidence suggests that an important stimulus
behind the rise of early civilizations was the
development of settled agriculture, which
unleashed a series of changes in the organization
of human communities that culminated in the rise of
large ancient empires.
The exact time and place that crops were first
cultivated successfully is uncertain. Many
prehistorians believe that farming may have
emerged independently in several different areas of
the world when small communities, driven by
increasing population and a decline in available
food resources, began to plant seeds in the ground
in an effort to guarantee their survival. The first
farmers, who may have lived as long as 10,000
years ago, undoubtedly used simple techniques
and still relied primarily on other forms of food
production, such as hunting, foraging, or
pastoralism. The real breakthrough took place
when farmers began to cultivate crops along the
floodplains of river systems. The advantage was
that crops grown in such areas were not as
dependent on rainfall and therefore produced a
more reliable harvest. An additional benefit was
that the sediment carried by the river waters
deposited nutrients in the soil, thus enabling the
farmer to cultivate a single plot of ground for many
years without moving to a new location. Thus, the
first truly sedentary (that is, nonmigratory) societies
were born. As time went on, such communities
gradually learned how to direct the flow of water to
enhance the productive capacity of the land, while
the introduction of the iron plow eventually led to
the cultivation of heavy soils not previously
susceptible to agriculture.
The spread of this river valley agriculture in various
parts of Asia and Africa was the decisive factor in
the rise of the first civilizations. The increase in
food production in these regions led to a significant
growth in population, while efforts to control the
flow of water to maximize the irrigation of cultivated
areas and to protect the local inhabitants from
hostile forces outside the community provoked the
first steps toward cooperative activities on a large
scale. The need to oversee the entire process
brought about the emergence of an elite that was
eventually transformed into a government.
The first clear steps in the rise of the first
civilizations took place in the fourth and third
millennia B.C. in Mesopotamia, northern Africa,
India, and China. How the first governments took
shape in these areas is not certain, but
anthropologists studying the evolution of human
communities in various parts of the world have
discovered that one common stage in the process
is the emergence of what are called "big men"
within a single village or a collection of villages. By
means of their military prowess, dominant
personalities, or political talents, these people
gradually emerge as the leaders of that community.
In time, the "big men" become formal symbols of
authority and pass on that authority to others within
their own family. As the communities continue to
grow in size and material wealth, the "big men"
assume hereditary status, and their allies and
family members are transformed into a hereditary
monarchy.
The appearance of these sedentary societies had a
major impact on the social organizations, religious
beliefs, and way of life of the peoples living within
their boundaries. With the increase in population
and the development of centralized authority came
the emergence of the cities. While some of these
urban centers were identified with a particular
economic function, such as proximity to gold or iron
deposits or a strategic location on a major trade
route, others served primarily as administrative
centers or the site of temples for the official cult or
other ritual observances. Within these cities, new
forms of livelihood appeared to satisfy the growing
need for social services and consumer goods.
Some people became artisans or merchants, while
others became warriors, scholars, or priests. In
some cases, the physical division within the first
cities reflected the strict hierarchical character of
the society as a whole, with a royal palace
surrounded by an imposing wall and separate from
the remainder of the urban population. In other
instances, such as the Indus River Valley, the cities
lacked a royal precinct and the ostentatious
palaces that marked their contemporaries
elsewhere.

72 – 3 Cities and Kingdoms in Alexander's
Empire
As Alexander the Great spread his empire (the
Hellenistic empire) from Macedon and Greece over
a large swath of southwestern Asia and northern
Africa, he established a number of Kingdoms that
became subjects of the empire. One of the major
developments of these new kingdoms was the
resurgence of monarchy, which had many
repercussions. For most Greeks, monarchs were
something out of the heroic past, something found
in Homer's mythical epic the Iliad but not in daily
life. Furthermore, most Hellenistic kingdoms
embraced numerous different peoples who had
little in common. Hellenistic kings thus needed a
new political concept to unite them. One solution
was the creation of a ruler cult that linked the king’s
authority with that of the gods. Thus, royal power
had divine approval and was meant to create a
political and religious bond between the kings and
their subjects. These deified kings were not
considered gods as mighty as Zeus or Apollo, and
the new ruler cults probably made little religious
impact on those ruled. Nonetheless, the ruler cult
was an easily understandable symbol of unity
within the kingdom.
Monarchy also included royal women, who began
to play an active part in political and diplomatic life.
Some of them did so in their own right, others in
collaboration with their husbands. For the most part
they served as examples that women too were
capable of shouldering vast responsibilities and
performing them successfully. Although
Alexander’s generals created huge kingdoms, the
concept of monarchy, even when combined with
the ruler cult, never replaced the ideal of the polis
(the ancient Greek city-state).
Consequently, the monarchies never won the deep
emotional loyalty that Greeks had once felt for the
polis. Hellenistic kings needed large numbers of
Greeks to run their kingdoms. Otherwise royal
business would grind to a halt, and the conquerors
would soon be swallowed up by the far more
numerous conquered population. Obviously, then,
the kings had to encourage Greeks to immigrate
and build new homes. The Hellenistic kings thus
confronted the problem of making life in the new
monarchies resemble the traditional Greek way of
life. Since Greek civilization was urban, the kings
continued Alexander’s policy of establishing cities
throughout their kingdoms in order to entice Greeks
to immigrate. Yet the creation of these cities posed
a serious political problem that the Hellenistic kings
failed to solve.
To the Greeks, civilized life was unthinkable without
the polis, which was far more than a mere city. The
Greek polis was by definition autonomous state run
by its citizens, free of any outside power or
restraint. Hellenistic kings, however, refused to
grant sovereignty to their cities. In effect, these
kings willingly built cities but refused to build a
polis.
Hellenistic monarchs gave their cities all the
external trappings of a polis. Each had an
assembly of citizens, a council to prepare
legislation, and a board of magistrates to conduct
the city’s political business. Yet, however similar to
the Greek polis they appeared, these cities could
not engage in diplomatic dealings, make treaties,
pursue their own foreign policy, or wage their own
wars. None could govern its own affairs without
interference from the king, who, even if he stood in
the background, was the real sovereign. In the
eyes of the king, the cities were important parts of
the kingdom, but the welfare of the whole kingdom
came first. The cities had to follow royal orders, and
the king often placed his own officials in the cities
to see that his decrees were followed.
A new Hellenistic city differed from a Greek polis in
other ways as well. The Greek polis had enjoyed
political and social unity even though it was
normally composed of citizens, non-citizens and
resident aliens. The polis had one body of law and
one set of customs. In the Hellenistic city, Greeks
represented an elite citizen class. Natives and nonGreek foreigners who lived in Hellenistic cities
usually possessed lesser rights than Greeks and
often had their own laws. In some instances this
disparity spurred natives to assimilate Greek
culture in order to rise politically and socially. The
Hellenistic city was not homogeneous and could
not spark the intensity of feeling that marked the
polis.
195
71 – 2 Minoan Palaces
The Minoan culture on the island of Crete in the
Aegean Sea flourished from about 3000to 1100
B.C.In what is known as the Palace Period (ca.
2000-1450 B. C.), power was centralized in
palaces and, later, in villas. According to one
authority, the five primary economic functions of
Minoan palaces during much of the Palace era
were (1) production of manufactured goods, (2)
consumption of food and manufactured goods. (3)
regulation of local and internal exchange. (4)
regulation of international and external exchange,
and (5) use as depositories (storage facilities)
The production and storage of manufactured goods
are evident from the archaeological digs at
Phaistos and Mallia. important palace sites,
Excavations of the earliest phases at Phaistos
(those from the so-called Firsl Palace Period, which
ended about 1700 B.C.)revealed two areas
dedicated to economic activity. Unit A contained
several large storage vessels originally filled with
foodstuffs, including liquids such as wine and oil.
Nearby Unit B was the palace workshop.
Here,excavators found tools used for stoneworking
(a lapidary workshop), several loom weights (a
weaving workshop), and two potter's wheels (a
ceramics workshop). Clay sealings from a smaller
room in Unit B may indicate where finished
products were processed for storage or export. By
the Second Palace Period (roughly 1700-1450
B.C.), there were even more food storage vessels
present and an archive room (a room for storing
documents).
Similar finds appeared at Mallia. In the northwest
quarter of the palace, excavators discovered
obsidian, soapstone,and a reddish marble called
rosso antico, all evidently part of the lapidary
(slonecuttmg) workshop. A potter's workshop was
also present within the palace walls. During part of
this period, the workshop of a bronze smithy was
located just outside the palace walls. It is actually
surprising that such an industry would be so close
to any residential quarters, considering the
unpleasant fumes given off by the work and the
rather high potential for fires. Nevertheless, at a
somewhat later date, the palace walls were
extended so that the smithy was located within the
palace itself,Clearly,this was an industry over which
the palace wanted to keep very close control.
The role of Mmoan palaces as depositories and
regulators of local distribution and trade may be
seen in the koulouras-large,stone-lined pits located
at Knossos. Phaistos,and in a slightly altered guise,
at Mallia. There is continued debate as to the
purpose of these huge storage bins. It was
originally suggested that they were rubbish pits.
Some modern scholars believe that they were giant
tree planters. But the usual interpretation is that
they were for gram storage, with the koulouras at
Knossos being able to hold enough gram to feed
1,000 people and the koulouras at Phaistos being
able to hold enough for 300 people. In such a case,
the palace would have received a substantial
portion of the agricultural produce of the
surrounding farms, stored it, and then distributed it
to the more specialized,nonagricultural populace of
the palace region.
Palatial control over foreign trade is more difficult to
prove archaeologically, as there is often no way to
determine where on Crete any specific item found
abroad was made. One argument often brought to
the fore is that only the palaces would have the
capital (to use a modern term) to finance the goods
and shipping for long trade journeys, not to mention
to handle the risks of possible sea wrecks. Another
argument,however,lies in the nature of the Mmoan
goods found abroad.For example,Kamares ware
pottery from Mmoan Crete has come to light on the
coasts of Cyprus and in areas of the Near East
such as Egypt and Syria. This Kamares ware is
clearly a product of palatial manufacture. The
ceramics from before and after the classical
Kamares wares are clearly local creationsKnossian ware being distinct from Malhan ware. By
contrast, the Kamares ware made in the palaces is
similar from palace to palace but is utterly distinct
from the provincial wares. The number of foreign
goods stored in the palaces,especially Zakro, also
gives evidence for the palatial control of
international exchange.

41 – 3 Trade and Early State Formation
Bartering was a basic trade mechanism for many
thousands of years; often sporadic and usually based
on notions of reciprocity, it involved the mutual
exchange of commodities or objects between
individuals or groups. Redistribution of these goods
through society lay in the hands of chiefs, religious
leaders, or kin groups. Such redistribution was a
basic element in chiefdoms. The change from
redistribution to formal trade—often based on
regulated commerce that perhaps involved fixed
prices and even currency—was closely tied to
growing political and social complexity and hence to
the development of the state in the ancient world.
In the 1970s, a number of archaeologists gave trade
a primary role in the rise of ancient states. British
archaeologist Colin Renfrew attributed the dramatic
flowering of the Minoan civilization on Crete and
through the Aegean to intensified trading contacts
and to the impact of olive and vine cultivation on local
communities. As agricultural economies became
more diversified and local food supplies could be
purchased both locally and over longer distances, a
far-reaching economic interdependence resulted.
Eventually, this led to redistribution systems for
luxuries and basic commodities, systems that were
organized and controlled by Minoan rulers from their
palaces. As time went on, the self-sufficiency of
communities was replaced by mutual dependence.
Interest in long-distance trade brought about some
cultural homogeneity from trade and gift exchange,
and perhaps even led to piracy. Thus, intensified
trade and interaction, and the flowering of specialist
crafts, in a complex process of positive feedback, led
to much more complex societies based on palaces,
which were the economic hubs of a new Minoan
civilization.
Renfrew’s model made some assumptions that are
now discounted. For example, he argued that the
introduction of domesticated vines and olives allowed
a substantial expansion of land under cultivation and
helped to power the emergence of complex society.
Many archaeologists and paleobotanists now
question this view, pointing out that the available
evidence for cultivated vines and olives suggests that
they were present only in the later Bronze Age.
Trade, nevertheless, was probably one of many
variables that led to the emergence of palace
economies in Minoan Crete.
American archaeologist William Rathje developed a
hypothesis that considered an explosion in longdistance exchange a fundamental cause of Mayan
civilization in Mesoamerica. He suggested that the
lowland Mayan environment was deficient in many
vital resources, among them obsidian, salt, stone for
grinding maize, and many luxury materials. All these
could be obtained from the nearby highlands, from
the Valley of Mexico, and from other regions, if the
necessary trading networks came into being. Such
connections, and the trading expeditions to maintain
them, could not be organized by individual villages.
The Maya lived in a relatively uniform environment,
where every community suffered from the same
resource deficiencies. Thus, argued Rathje, longdistance trade networks were organized through local
ceremonial centers and their leaders. In time, this
organization became a state, and knowledge of its
functioning was exportable, as were pottery, tropical
bird feathers, specialized stone materials, and other
local commodities.
Rathje’s hypothesis probably explains part of the
complex process of Mayan state formation, but it
suffers from the objection that suitable alternative raw
materials can be found in the lowlands. It could be,
too, that warfare became a competitive response to
population growth and to the increasing scarcity of
prime agricultural land, and that it played an important
role in the emergence of the Mayan states.
Now that we know much more about ancient
exchange and commerce, we know that, because no
one aspect of trade was an overriding cause of
cultural change or evolution in commercial practices,
trade can never be looked on as a unifying factor or
as a primary agent of ancient civilization. Many everchanging variables affected ancient trade, among
them the demand for goods. There were also the
logistics of transportation, the extent of the trading
network, and the social and political environment.
Intricate market networks channeled supplies along
well-defined routes. Authorities at both ends might
regulate the profits fed back to the source, providing
the incentive for further transactions. There may or
may not have been a market organization. Extensive
long-distance trade was a consequence rather than a
cause of complex societies.

40 – 1 Ancient Athens
One of the most important changes in Greece
during the period from 800 B.C. to 500 B.C. was
the rise of the polis, or city-state, and each polis
developed a system of government that was
appropriate to its circumstances. The problems that
were faced and solved in Athens were the sharing
of political power between the established
aristocracy and the emerging other classes, and
the adjustment of aristocratic ways of life to the
ways of life of the new polis. It was the harmonious
blending of all of these elements that was to
produce the classical culture of Athens.
Entering the polis age, Athens had the traditional
institutions of other Greek protodemocratic states:
an assembly of adult males, an aristocratic council,
and annually elected officials. Within this traditional
framework the Athenians, between 600 B.C. and
450 B. C., evolved what Greeks regarded as a fully
fledged democratic constitution, though the right to
vote was given to fewer groups of people than is
seen in modem times.
The first steps toward change were taken by Solon
in 594 B. C.，when he broke the aristocracy's
stranglehold on elected offices by establishing
wealth rather than birth as the basis of office
holding, abolishing the economic obligations of
ordinary Athenians to the aristocracy, and allowing
the assembly (of which all citizens were equal
members) to overrule the decisions of local courts
in certain cases. The strength of the Athenian
aristocracy was further weakened during the rest of
the century by the rise of a type of government
known as a tyranny, which is a form of interim rule
by a popular strongman (not rule by a ruthless
dictator as the modern use of the term suggests to
us). The Peisistratids, as the succession of tyrants
were called (after the founder of the dynasty,
Peisistratos), strengthened Athenian central
administration at the expense of the aristocracy by
appointing judges throughout the region, producing
Athens’ first national coinage, and adding and
embellishing festivals that tended to focus attention
on Athens rather than on local villages of the
surrounding region. By the end of the century, the
time was ripe for more change: the tyrants were
driven out, and in 508 B C a new reformer,
Cleisthenes, gave final form to the developments
reducing aristocratic control already under way.
Cleisthenes' principal contribution to the creation of
democracy at Athens was to complete the long
process of weakening family and clan structures,
especially among the aristocrats, and to set in their
place locality-based corporations called demes,
which became the point of entry for all civic and
most religious life in Athens. Out of the demes were
created 10 artificial tribes of roughly equal
population. From the demes, by either election or
selection, came 500 members of a new council,
6,000 jurors for the courts, 10 generals, and
hundreds of commissioners. The assembly was
sovereign in all matters but in practice delegated its
power to subordinate bodies such as the council,
which prepared the agenda for the meetings of the
assembly, and the courts, which took care of most
judicial matters. Various committees acted as an
executive branch, implementing policies of the
assembly and supervising, for instance, the food
and water supplies and public buildings. This widescale participation by the citizenry in the
government distinguished the democratic form of
the Athenian polis from other, less liberal forms.
The effect of Cleisthenes’ reforms was to establish
the superiority of the Athenian community as a
whole over local institutions without destroying
them. National politics rather than local or deme
politics became the focal point. At the same time,
entry into national politics began at the deme level
and gave local loyalty a new focus: Athens itself.
Over the next two centuries the implications of
Cleisthenes’ reforms were fully exploited.
During the fifth century B. C. the council of 500 was
extremely influential in shaping policy. In the next
century, however, it was the mature assembly that
took on decision-making responsibility. By any
measure other than that of the aristocrats, who had
been upstaged by the supposedly inferior "people,"
the Athenian democracy was a stunning success.
Never before, or since, have so many people been
involved in the serious business of selfgovernance. It was precisely this opportunity to
participate in public life that provided a stimulus for
the brilliant unfolding of classical Greek culture.

42 – 4 Europe in the Twelfth Century
Europe in the eleventh century underwent
enormous social, technological, and economic
changes, but this did not create a new Europe—it
created two new ones. The north was developed
as a rigidly hierarchical society in which status was
determined, or was at least indicated, by the extent
to which one owned, controlled, or labored on land;
whereas the Mediterranean south developed a
more fluid, and therefore more chaotic, world in
which industry and commerce predominated and
social status both reflected and resulted from the
role that one played in the public life of the
community. In other words, individual identity and
social community in the north were established on
a personal basis, whereas in the south they were
established on a civic basis. By the start of the
twelfth century, northern and southern Europe were
very different places indeed, and the Europeans
themselves noticed it and commented on it.
Political dominance belonged to the north.
Germany, France, and England had large
Populations and large armies that made them, in
the political and military senses, the masters of
Western Europe. Organized by the practices known
collectively as feudalism, these kingdoms emerged
as powerful states with sophisticated machineries
of government. Their kings and queens were the
leading figures of the age; their castles and
cathedrals stood majestically on the landscape as
symbols of their might; their armies both energized
and defined the age. Moreover, feudal society
showed a remarkable ability to adapt to new needs
by encouraging the parallel development of
domestic urban life and commercial networks; in
some regions of the north, in fact, feudal society
may even have developed in response to the start
of the trends toward bigger cities. But southern
Europe took the lead in economic and cultural life.
Though the leading Mediterranean states were
small in size, they were considerably wealthier than
their northern counterparts. The Italian city of
Palermo in the twelfth century, for example, alone
generated four times the commercial tax revenue of
the entire kingdom of England. Southern
communities also possessed urbane, multilingual
cultures that made them the intellectual and artistic
leaders of the age.
Levels of general literacy in the south far
surpassed those of the north, and the people of the
south put that learning to use on a large scale.
Science, mathematics, poetry, law, historical
writing, religious speculation, translation, and
classical studies all began to flourish; throughout
most of the twelfth century, most of the continent's
best brains flocked to southern Europe.
So too did a lot of the north's soldiers. One of the
central themes of the political history of the twelfth
century was the continual effort by the northern
kingdoms to extend their control southward in the
hope of tapping into the Mediterranean bonanza.
The German emperors starting with Otto I (936-
973), for example, struggled ceaselessly to
establish their control over the cities of northern
Italy, since those cities generated more revenue
than all of rural Germany combined. The kings of
France used every means at their disposal to push
the lower border of their kingdom to the
Mediterranean shoreline. And the Normans who
conquered and ruled England established outposts
of Norman power in Sicily and the adjacent lands of
southern Italy; the English kings also hoped or
claimed at various times to be, either through
money or marriage diplomacy, the rulers of several
Mediterranean states. But as the northern world
pressed southward, so too did some of the cultural
norms and social mechanisms of the south expand
northward. Over the course of the twelfth century,
the feudal kingdoms witnessed a proliferation of
cities modeled in large degree on those of the
south. Contact with the merchants and financiers of
the Mediterranean led to the development of
northern industry and international trade (which
helped to pay for many of the castles and
cathedrals mentioned earlier). And education
spread as well, culminating in the foundation of
what is arguably medieval Europe's greatest
invention: the university. The relationship of north
and south was symbiotic, in other words, and the
contrast between them was more one of
differences in degree than of polar opposition.

43 – 1 The Empire of Alexander the Great
In 334 B.C. Alexander the Great took his Greek
armies to the east and in only a few years
completed his creation of an empire out of much of
southwest Asia in the new empire, barriers to trade
and the movement of peoples were removed;
markets were put in touch with one another. In the
next generation thousands of Greek traders and
artisans would enter this wider world to seek their
fortunes. Alexander’s actions had several important
consequences for the region occupied by the
empire.
The first of these was the expansion of Greek
civilization throughout the Middle East. Greek
became the great international language. Towns
and cities were established not only as garrisons
(military posts) but as centers for the diffusion of
Greek language, literature, and thought, particularly
through libraries, as at Antioch (in modern Turkey)
and the most famous of all, at Alexandria in Egypt,
which would be the finest in the world for the next
thousand years.
Second, this internationalism spelled the end of the
classical Greek city-state——the unit of
government in ancient Greece——and everything it
stood for. Most city-states had been quite small in
terms of citizenry, and this was considered to be a
good thing. The focus of life was the agora, the
open marketplace where assemblies could be held
and where issues of the day, as well as more
fundamental topics such as the purpose of
government or the relationship between law and
freedom, could be discussed and decisions made
by individuals in person. The philosopher Plato
(428-348 B.C.) felt that the ideal city-state should
have about 5,000 citizens, because to the Greeks it
was important that everyone in the community
should know each other. In decision making, the
whole body of citizens together would have the
necessary knowledge in order generally to reach
the right decision, even though the individual might
not be particularly qualified to decide. The
philosopher Aristotle (384-322 B.C.), who lived at a
time when the city-state system was declining,
believed that a political entity of 100,000 simply
would not be able to govern itself.
This implied that the city-state was based on the
idea that citizens were not specialists but had
multiple interests and talents——each a so-called
jack-of-all-trades who could engage in many areas
of life and politics. It implied a respect for the
wholeness of life and a consequent dislike of
specialization. It implied economic and military selfsufficiency. But with the development of trade and
commerce in Alexander’s empire came the growth
of cities; it was no longer possible to be a jack-ofall-trades. One now had to specialize, and with
specialization came professionalism. There were
getting to be too many persons to know, an easily
observable community of interests was being
replaced by a multiplicity of interests. The city-state
was simply too "small-time."
Third, Greek philosophy was opened up to the
philosophy and religion of the East. At the peak of
the Greek city-state, religion played an important
part. Its gods—such as Zeus, father of the gods,
and his wife Hera—were thought of very much as
being like human beings but with superhuman
abilities. Their worship was linked to the rituals
connected with one’s progress through life—birth,
marriage, and death— and with invoking protection
against danger, making prophecies, and promoting
healing, rather than to any code of behavior. Nor
was there much of a theory of afterlife.
Even before Alexander’s time, a life spent in the
service of their city-state no longer seemed ideal to
Greeks. The Athenian philosopher Socrates (470-
399 B.C.) was the first person in Greece to propose
a morality based on individual conscience rather
than the demands of the state, and for this he was
accused of not believing in the city’s gods and so
corrupting the youth, and he was condemned to
death. Greek philosophy—or even a focus on
conscience—might complement religion but was no
substitute for it, and this made Greeks receptive to
the religious systems of the Middle East, even if
they never adopted them completely. The
combination of the religious instinct of Asia with the
philosophic spirit of Greece spread across the
world in the era after Alexander’s death, blending
the culture of the Middle East with the culture of
Greece.

46 – 2 The Commercial Revolution in Medieval
Europe
Beginning in the 1160s, the opening of new silver
mines in northern Europe led to the minting and
circulation of vast quantities of silver coins. The
widespread use of cash greatly increased the
volume of international trade. Business procedures
changed radically. The individual traveling
merchant who alone handled virtually all aspects of
exchange evolved into an operation involving three
separate types of merchants: the sedentary
merchant who ran the "home office," financing and
organizing the firm’s entire export-import trade; the
carriers who transported goods by land and sea;
and the company agents resident in cities abroad
who, on the advice of the home office, looked after
sales and procurements.
Commercial correspondence, unnecessary when
one businessperson oversaw everything and made
direct bargains with buyers and sellers, multiplied.
Regular courier service among commercial cities
began. Commercial accounting became more
complex when firms had to deal with shareholders,
manufacturers, customers, branch offices,
employees, and competing firms. Tolls on roads
became high enough to finance what has been
called a road revolution, involving new surfaces
and bridges, new passes through the Alps, and
new inns and hospices for travelers. The growth of
mutual trust among merchants facilitated the
growth of sales on credit and led to new
developments in finance, such as the bill of
exchange, a device that made the long, slow, and
very dangerous shipment of coins unnecessary.
The ventures of the German Hanseatic League
illustrate these advancements. The Hanseatic
League was a mercantile association of European
towns dating from 1159. The league grew by the
end of the fourteenth century to include about 200
cities from Holland to Poland. Across regular, welldefined trade routes along the Baltic and North
seas, the ships of league cities carried furs, wax,
copper, fish, grain, timber, and wine. These goods
were exchanged for finished products, mainly cloth
and salt, from western cities. At cities such as
Bruges and London, Hanseatic merchants secured
special trading concessions, exempting them from
all tolls and allowing them to trade at local fairs.
Hanseatic merchants established foreign trading
centers, the most famous of which was the London
Steelyard, a walled community with warehouses,
offices, a church, and residential quarters for
company representatives. By the late thirteenth
century, Hanseatic merchants had developed an
important business technique, the business
register. Merchants publicly recorded their debts
and contracts and received a league guarantee for
them. This device proved a decisive factor in the
later development of credit and commerce in
northern Europe.
These developments added up to what one
modern scholar has called "a commercial
revolution." In the long run, the commercial
revolution of the High Middle Ages (A D 1000-
1300) brought about radical change in European
society. One remarkable aspect of this change was
that the commercial classes constituted a small
part of the total population—never more than 10
percent. They exercised an influence far in excess
of their numbers. The commercial revolution
created a great deal of new wealth, which meant a
higher standard of living. The existence of wealth
did not escape the attention of kings and other
rulers. Wealth could be taxed, and through
taxation, kings could create strong and centralized
states. In the years to come, alliances with the
middle classes were to enable kings to weaken
aristocratic interests and build the states that came
to be called modern.
The commercial revolution also provided the
opportunity for thousands of agricultural workers to
improve their social position. The slow but steady
transformation of European society from almost
completely rural and isolated to relatively more
urban constituted the greatest effect of the
commercial revolution that began in the eleventh
century. Even so, merchants and business people
did not run medieval communities, except in central
and northern Italy and in the county of Flanders.
Most towns remained small. The nobility and
churchmen determined the predominant social
attitudes, values, and patterns of thought and
behavior. The commercial changes of the eleventh
through fourteenth centuries did however, lay the
economic foundation for the development of urban
life and culture.
201
48 – 4 The Rise of Moscow
The rise of Moscow during medieval times was a
fundamental development in Russian history.
Moscow began with very little and for a long time
could not be compared to such flourishing
principalities as Novgorod or Galicia. Even in its
own area, the northeast, it was junior to old centers
like Rostov and Suzdal. In accounting for Moscow's
rise, historians have emphasized several factors or
rather groups of factors.
First, attention may be given to the doctrine of
geographic causation. It stresses the decisive
importance of the location on Moscow for the later
expansion of the Muscovite state (the medieval
state centered in Moscow) and includes several
lines of argument. Moscow lay as a crossing of
three roads. The most important was the way from
the historically crucial city of Kiev and the declining
south to the growing northeast. In fact Moscow has
been described as the first stopping and setting
point in the northeast. But it also profited from
moments in other directions, including the reverse.
Thus it seems immigrants came to Moscow after
the Mongol devastation of the lands further to the
northeast. Moscow was also situated on a bend of
the Moscow River that flows from the northwest to
the southeast into the Oka, the largest western
tributary of the Volga River. To speak more broadly
of water communications which span and unite
European Russia, Moscow has the rare fortune of
being located near the headwaters of four major
rivers: the Oka, the Volga, the Don, and the
Dnieper. This offered marvelous opportunities for
expansion across the flowing plain, especially as
there were no mountains or other natural obstacles
to hem in the young principality.
In another sense too, Moscow benefited from a
central position. It stood in the midst of lands
inhabited by the Russian people which, so the
argument runs, provided a proper setting for a
natural growth in all directions. In fact some
specialists have tried to estimate precisely how
close to the geographic center of the Russian
people Moscow was situated, noting also such
circumstances as proximity to the land dividing the
two main dialects of the Great Russian language.
Central location within Russia, to make an
additional point, cushioned Moscow from outside
invaders. Thus, for example, it was the city of
Novgorod, not Moscow, that continuously had to
meet enemies from the northwest, while in the
southeast Ryazan absorbed the first blows from the
direction. All in all, the considerable significance of
the location on Moscow cannot be denied although
this geographic factor has generally been assigned
less relative weight by recent scholars.
The economic argument is linked in part to the
geographic. The Moscow River served as an
important trade artery, and as the Muscovite
principality expanded around its waterways, it
profited by and in turn helped to promote
increasing economic intercourse. One school of
thought has treated the expansion of Moscow
largely in terms of the growth of a common market.
Another economic approach emphasizes the
success of the Muscovite princes in developing
agriculture in their domains and supporting
colonization. These princes clearly outdistance
their rivals in obtaining peasants to settle on their
lands. As a further advantage, they managed to
maintain in their realm a relative peace and security
highly beneficial to economic life.
The last view introduces another key factor in
explaining the Muscovite rise: the role of the rulers
of Moscow. Moscow has generally been
considered fortunate in its princes. Sheer luck
constituted an important part of the picture. For
several generations, the princes of Moscow had
the advantage of male succession without
interruption or conflict. In particular, for a long time
the sons of the princes of Moscow were lucky not
to have uncles competing for the Muscovite seat.
When the classic power struggle between royal
uncles and nephews finally erupted under Basil
II(reigned 1425-1462), direct succession from
father to son possessed sufficient standing and
support in the principality of Moscow to overcome
the challenge. The principality has also been
considered fortunate because its early rulers,
descending from the youngest son of Alexander
Nevskii (1220?-1263) and thus representing a
junior princely branch, found it expedient to devote
themselves to their small holdings instead of
neglecting them for more ambitious undertakings
elsewhere.
202
48 – 1 Chinese Population Growth
Increases in population have usually been
accompanied (indeed facilitated) by an increase in
trade. In the Western experience, commerce
provided the conditions that allowed
industrialization to get started, which in turn led to
growth in science, technology, industry, transport,
communications, social change, and the like that
we group under the broad term of “development.”
However, the massive increase in population that
in Europe was at first attributed to industrialization
starting in the eighteenth century occurred also and
at the same period in China, even though there
was no comparable industrialization.
It is estimated that the Chinese population by 1600
was close to 150 million. The transition between
the Ming and Qing dynasties (the seventeenth
century) may have seen a decline, but from 1741 to
1851 the annual figures rose steadily and
spectacularly, perhaps beginning with 143 million
and ending with 432 million. If we accept these
totals, we are confronted with a situation in which
the Chinese population doubled in the 50 years
from 1790 to 1840. If, with greater caution, we
assume lower totals in the early eighteenth century
and only 400 million in 1850, we still face a startling
fact: something like a doubling of the vast Chinese
population in the century before Western contact,
foreign trade, and industrialization could have had
much effect.
To explain this sudden increase we cannot point to
factors constant in Chinese society but must find
conditions or a combination of factors that were
newly effective in this period. Among these is the
almost complete internal peace maintained under
Manchu rule during the eighteenth century. There
was also an increase in foreign trade through
Guangzhou (southern China) and some
improvement of transportation within the empire.
Control of disease, like the checking of smallpox by
variolation may have been important. But of most
critical importance was the food supply.
Confronted with a multitude of unreliable figures,
economists have compared the population records
with the aggregate data for cultivated land area and
grain production in the six centuries since 1368.
Assuming that China’s population in 1400 was
about 80 million, the economist Dwight Perkins
concludes that its growth to 700 million or more in
the 1960s was made possible by a steady increase
in the grain supply, which evidently grew five or six
times between 1400 and 1800 and rose another 50
percent between 1800 and 1965. This increase of
food supply was due perhaps half to the increase
of cultivated area, particularly by migration and
settlement in the central and western provinces,
and half to greater productivity—the farmers’
success in raising more crops per unit of land.
This technological advance took many forms: one
was the continual introduction from the south of
earlier-ripening varieties of rice, which made
possible double-cropping (the production of two
harvests per year from one field). New crops such
as corn (maize) and sweet potatoes as well as
peanuts and tobacco were introduced from the
Americas. Corn, for instance, can be grown on the
dry soil and marginal hill land of North China,
where it is used for food, fuel, and fodder and
provides something like one-seventh of the food
energy available in the area. The sweet potato,
growing in sandy soil and providing more food
energy per unit of land than other crops, became
the main food of the poor in much of the South
China rice area.
Productivity in agriculture was also improved by
capital investments, first of all in irrigation. From
1400 to 1900 the total of irrigated land seems to
have increased almost three times. There was also
a gain in farm tools, draft animals, and fertilizer, to
say nothing of the population growth itself, which
increased half again as fast as cultivated land area
and so increased the ratio of human hands
available per unit of land. Thus the rising
population was fed by a more intensive agriculture,
applying more labor and fertilizer to the land.

50 – 2 The Achievement of Brazilian
Independence
In contrast to the political anarchy, economic
dislocation, and military destruction in Spanish
America, Brazil's drive toward independence from
Portugal proceeded as a relatively bloodless
transition between 1808 and 1822. The idea of
Brazilian independence first arose in the late
eighteenth century as a Brazilian reaction to the
Portuguese policy of tightening political and
economic control over the colony in the interests of
the mother country. The first significant conspiracy
against Portuguese rule was organized from 1788-
1799 in the province of Minas Gerais, where rigid
governmental control over the production and
prices of gold and diamonds, as well as heavy
taxes, caused much discontent. But this conspiracy
never went beyond the stage of discussion and
was easily discovered and crushed. Other
conspiracies in the late eighteenth century as well
as a brief revolt in 1817 reflected the influence of
republican ideas over sections of the elite and even
the lower strata of urban society. All proved
abortive or were soon crushed. Were it not for an
accident of European history, the independence of
Brazil might have been long delayed.
The French invasion of Portugal in 1807 followed
by the flight of the Portuguese court (sovereign and
government officers) to Rio de Janeiro brought
large benefits to Brazil. Indeed, the transfer of the
court in effect signified achievement of Brazilian
independence. The Portuguese prince and future
King Joao VI opened Brazil's ports to the trade of
friendly nations, permitted the rise of local
industries, and founded the Bank of Brazil. In 1815
he elevated Brazil to the legal status of a kingdom
coequal with Portugal. In one sense, however,
Brazil's new status signified the substitution of one
dependence for another. Freed from Portuguese
control, Brazil came under the economic
dominance of England, which obtained major tariff
concessions and other privileges by the Strangford
Treaty of 1810 between Portugal and Great Britain.
The treaty provided for the importation of British
manufactures into Brazil and the export of Brazilian
agricultural produce to Great Britain. One result
was an influx of cheap machine-made goods that
swamped the handicrafts industry of the country.
Brazilian elites took satisfaction in Brazil's new role
and the growth of educational, cultural, and
economic opportunities for their class. But the
feeling was mixed with resentment toward the
thousands of Portuguese courtiers (officials) and
hangers-on who came with the court and who
competed with Brazilians for jobs and favors. Thus,
the change in the status of Brazil sharpened the
conflict between Portuguese elites born in Brazil
and elites born in Portugal and loyal to the
Portuguese crown.
The event that precipitated the break with the
mother country was the revolution of 1820 in
Portugal. The Portuguese revolutionaries framed a
liberal constitution for the kingdom, but they were
conservative or reactionary in relation to Brazil.
They demanded the immediate return of King Joao
to Lisbon, an end to the system of dual monarchy
that he had devised, and the restoration of the
Portuguese commercial monopoly. Timid and
vacillating, King Joao did not know which way to
turn. Under the pressure of his courtiers, who
hungered to return to Portugal and their lost
estates, he finally approved the new constitution
and sailed for Portugal. He left behind him,
however, his son and heir, Pedro, and in a private
letter advised him that in the event the Brazilians
should demand independence, he should assume
leadership of the movement and set the crown of
Brazil on his head.
Soon it became clear that the Portuguese
parliament intended to set the clock back by
abrogating all the liberties and concessions won by
Brazil since 1808. One of its decrees insisted on
the immediate return of Pedro from Brazil. The
pace of events moved more rapidly in 1822. On
January 9, urged on by Brazilian advisers who
perceived a golden opportunity to make an orderly
transition to independence without the intervention
of the masses, Pedro refused an order from the
parliament to return to Portugal, saying famously, "l
remain." On September 7, regarded by all
Brazilians as Independence Day, he issued the
even more celebrated proclamation,
"Independence or death!" In December 1822,
having overcome slight resistance by Portuguese
troops, Dom Pedro was formally proclaimed
constitutional Emperor of Brazil.

51 – 3 Population Growth in Nineteenth-Century
Europe
Because of industrialization, but also because of a
vast increase in agricultural output without which
industrialization would have been impossible,
Western Europeans by the latter half of the
nineteenth century enjoyed higher standards of
living and longer, healthier lives than most of the
world's peoples. In Europe as a whole, the
population rose from 188 million in 1800 to 400
million in 1900. By 1900, virtually every area of
Europe had contributed to the tremendous surge of
population, but each major region was at a different
stage of demographic change.
Improvements in the food supply continued trends
that had started in the late seventeenth century.
New lands were put under cultivation, while the use
of crops of American origin, particularly the potato,
continued to expand. Setbacks did occur. Regional
agricultural failures were the most common cause
of economic recessions until 1850, and they could
lead to localized famine as well. A major potato
blight (disease) in 1846-1847 led to the deaths of at
least one million persons in Ireland and the
emigration of another million, and Ireland never
recovered the population levels the potato had
sustained to that point. Bad grain harvests at the
same time led to increased hardship throughout
much of Europe.
After 1850, however, the expansion of foods more
regularly kept pace with population growth, though
the poorer classes remained malnourished. Two
developments were crucial. First, the application of
science and new technology to agriculture
increased. Led by German universities, increasing
research was devoted to improving seeds,
developing chemical fertilizers, and advancing
livestock. After 1861, with the development of landgrant universities in the United States that had
huge agricultural programs, American cropproduction research added to this mix.
Mechanization included the use of horse-drawn
harvesters and seed drills, many developed initially
in the United States. It also included mechanical
cream separators and other food-processing
devices that improved supply.
The second development involved industrially
based transportation. With trains and steam
shipping, it became possible to move foods to
needy regions within Western Europe quickly.
Famine (as opposed to malnutrition) became a
thing of the past. Many Western European
countries, headed by Britain, began also to import
increasing amounts of food, not only from Eastern
Europe, a traditional source, but also from the
Americas, Australia, and New Zealand. Steam
shipping, which improved speed and capacity, as
well as new procedures for canning and
refrigerating foods (particularly after 1870), was
fundamental to these developments.
Europe's population growth included one additional
innovation by the nineteenth century: it combined
with rapid urbanization. More and more Western
Europeans moved from countryside to city, and big
cities grew most rapidly of all. By 1850, over half of
all the people in England lived in cities, a first in
human history. In one sense, this pattern seems
inevitable: growing numbers of people pressed
available resources on the land, even when
farmwork was combined with a bit of
manufacturing, so people crowded into cities
seeking work or other resources. Traditionally,
however, death rates in cities surpassed those in
the countryside by a large margin; cities had
maintained population only through steady inmigration. Thus rapid urbanization should have
reduced overall population growth, but by the
middle of the nineteenth century this was no longer
the case. Urban death rates remained high,
particularly in the lower-class slums, but they
began to decline rapidly.
The greater reliability of food supplies was a factor
in the decline of urban death rates. Even more
important were the gains in urban sanitation, as
well as measures such as inspection of housing.
Reformers, including enlightened doctors, began to
study the causes of high death rates and to urge
remediation. Even before the discovery of germs,
beliefs that disease spread by "miasmas" (noxious
forms of bad air) prompted attention to sewers and
open garbage; Edwin Chadwick led an exemplary
urban crusade for underground sewers in England
in the 1830s. Gradually, public health provisions
began to cut into customary urban mortality rates.
By 1900, in some parts of Western Europe life
expectancy in the cities began to surpass that of
the rural areas. Industrial societies had figured out
ways to combine large and growing cities with
population growth, a development that would soon
spread to other parts of the world.
205
50 – 1 American Railroads
In the United States, railroads spearheaded the
second phase of the transportation revolution by
overtaking the previous importance of canals. The
mid-1800s saw a great expansion of American
railroads. The major cities east of the Mississippi
River were linked by a spider web of railroad
tracks. Chicago's growth illustrates the impact of
these rail links. In 1849 Chicago was a village of a
few hundred people with virtually no rail service. By
1860 it had become a city of 100,000, served by
eleven railroads. Farmers to the north and west of
Chicago no longer had to ship their grain, livestock,
and dairy products down the Mississippi River to
New Orleans; they could now ship their products
directly east. Chicago supplanted New Orleans as
the interior of America's main commercial hub.
The east-west rail lines stimulated the settlement
and agricultural development of the Midwest. By
1860, Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin had replaced
Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York as the leading
wheat-growing states. Enabling farmers to speed
their products to the East, railroads increased the
value of farmland and promoted additional
settlement. In turn, population growth in agricultural
areas triggered industrial development in cities
such as Chicago, Davenport (Iowa), and
Minneapolis, for the new settlers needed lumber for
fences and houses and mills to grind wheat into
flour.
Railroads also propelled the growth of small towns
along their routes. The Illinois Central Railroad,
which had more track than any other railroad in
1855, made money not only from its traffic but also
from real estate speculation. Purchasing land for
stations along its path, the Illinois Central then laid
out towns around the stations. The selection of
Manteno, Illinois, as a stop of the Illinois Central,
for example, transformed the site from a
crossroads without a single house in 1854 into a
bustling town of nearly a thousand in 1860, replete
with hotels, lumberyards, grain elevators, and
gristmills. By the Civil War (1861-1865), few
thought of the railroad-linked Midwest as a frontier
region or viewed its inhabitants as pioneers.
As the nation's first big business, the railroads
transformed the conduct of business. During the
early 1830s, railroads, like canals, depended on
financial aid from state governments. With the
onset of economic depression in the late 1830s,
however, state governments scrapped overly
ambitious railroad projects. Convinced that
railroads burdened them with high taxes and
blasted hopes, voters turned against state aid, and
in the early 1840s, several states amended their
constitutions to bar state funding for railroads and
canals. The federal government took up some of
the slack, but federal aid did not provide a major
stimulus to railroads before 1860. Rather, part of
the burden of finance passed to city and county
governments in agricultural areas that wanted to
attract railroads. Such municipal governments, for
example, often gave railroads rights-of-way, grants
of land for stations, and public funds.
The dramatic expansion of the railroad network in
the 1850s, however, strained the financing capacity
of local governments and required a turn toward
private investment, which had never been absent
from the picture. Well aware of the economic
benefits of railroads, individuals living near them
had long purchased railroad stock issued by
governments and had directly bought stock in
railroads, often paying by contributing their labor to
building the railroads. But the large railroads of the
1850s needed more capital than such small
investors could generate. Gradually, the center of
railroad financing shifted to New York City, and in
fact, it was the railroad boom of the 1850s that
helped make Wall Street in New York City the
nation's greatest capital market. The stocks of all
the leading railroads were traded on the floor of the
New York Stock Exchange during the 1850s. In
addition, the growth of railroads turned New York
City into the center of modern investment firms.
The investment firms evaluated the stock of
railroads in the smaller American cities and then
found purchasers for these stocks in New York
City, Philadelphia, Paris, London, Amsterdam, and
Hamburg. Controlling the flow of funds to railroads,
the investment bankers began to exert influence
over the railroads' internal affairs by supervising
administrative reorganizations in times of trouble.

52 – 3 Early Food Production in Sub-Saharan
Africa
At the end of the Pleistocene (around 10,000 B.C.),
the technologies of food production may have
already been employed on the fringes of the rain
forests of western and central Africa, where the
common use of such root plants as the African yam
led people to recognize the advantages of growing
their own food. The yam can easily be resprouted if
the top is replanted. This primitive form of
"vegeculture" (cultivation of root and tree crops)
may have been the economic tradition onto which
the cultivation of summer rainfall cereal crops was
grafted as it came into use south of the grassland
areas on the Sahara's southern borders.
As the Sahara dried up after 5000 B.C., pastoral
peoples (cattle herders) moved southward along
major watercourses into the savanna belt of West
Africa and the Sudan. By 3000 B.C., just as ancient
Egyptian civilization was coming into being along
the Nile, they had settled in the heart of the East
African highlands far to the south. The East African
highlands are ideal cattle country and the home
today of such famous cattle-herding peoples as the
Masai. The highlands were inhabited by huntergatherers living around mountains near the plains
until about 3300 B.C., when the first cattle herders
appeared. These cattle people may have moved
between fixed settlements during the wet and dry
seasons, living off hunting in the dry months and
their own livestock and agriculture during the rains.
As was the case elsewhere, cattle were demanding
animals in Africa. They required water at least
every 24 hours and large tracts of grazing grass if
herds of any size were to be maintained. The
secret was the careful selection of grazing land,
especially in environments where seasonal rainfall
led to marked differences in graze quality
throughout the year. Even modest cattle herds
required plenty of land and considerable mobility.
To acquire such land often required moving herds
considerable distances, even from summer to
winter pastures. At the same time, the cattle
owners had to graze their stock in tsetse-fly-free
areas. The only protection against human and
animal sleeping sickness, a disease carried by the
tsetse fly, was to avoid settling or farming such
areas—a constraint severely limiting the
movements of cattle-owning farmers in eastern and
central Africa. As a result, small cattle herds spread
south rapidly in areas where they could be grazed.
Long before cereal agriculture took hold far south
of the Sahara, some hunter-gatherer groups in the
savanna woodlands of eastern and southern Africa
may have acquired cattle, and perhaps other
domesticated animals, by gift exchange or through
raids on herding neighbors.
Contrary to popular belief: there is no such
phenomenon as "pure" pastoralists, a society that
subsists on its herds alone. The Saharan herders
who moved southward to escape drought were
almost certainly also cultivating sorghum, millet;
and other tropical rainfall crops. By 1500 B.C.,
cereal agriculture was widespread throughout the
savanna belt south of the Sahara. Small farming
communities dotted the grasslands and forest
margins of eastern West Africa, all of them
depending on what is called shifting agriculture.
This form of agriculture involved clearing woodland,
burning the felled brush over the cleared plot,
mixing the ash into the soil, and then cultivating the
prepared fields. After a few years, the soil was
exhausted, so the farmer moved on, exploiting new
woodland and leaving the abandoned fields to lie
fallow. Shifting agriculture, often called slash-andburn, was highly adaptive for savanna farmers
without plows, for it allowed cereal farming with the
minimal expenditure of energy.
The process of clearance and burning may have
seemed haphazard to the uninformed eye, but it
was not. Except in favored areas, such as regularly
inundated floodplains: tropical Africa's soils were of
only moderate to low fertility. The art of farming
was careful soil selection, that is, knowing which
soils were light and easily cultivable, could be
readily turned with small hoes, and would maintain
their fertility over several years' planting, for cereal
crops rapidly remove nitrogen and other nutrients
from the soil. Once it had taken hold: slash-andburn agriculture expanded its frontiers rapidly as
village after village took up new lands, moving
forward so rapidly that one expert has estimated it
took a mere two centuries to cover 2,000
kilometers from eastern to southern Africa.
207
52 – 4 England’s Economy in sixteenth century
In the last half of the sixteenth century England
emerged as a commercial and manufacturing
power in Europe due to a combination of
demographic, agricultural and industrial factors.
The population of England and Wales grew rapidly
from about 2.5 million in the 1520s to more than
3.5 million in 1580, reaching about 4.5 million in
1610. Reduced mortality rates and increased
fertility, the latter probably generated by expanding
work opportunities in manufacturing and farming
(leading to earlier marriage and more children),
explained this rapid rise in population. While
epidemics and plague occasionally took their toll,
the people in England still suffered less than did
those in continental Europe. Furthermore, the
country had been pulled out of the war that
occurred in France and central Europe during the
same period.
England provides the prominent example of the
expansion of agricultural production well before the
general European agricultural revolution of the
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. A larger
population stimulated the increased woollen
through crop civilization. English agriculture
became more efficient and market-oriented than
almost anywhere else on the continent. Between
1450 and 1640 the yield of grain per acre
increased by at least thirty percent. In sharp
contrast with farming in Spain, English land owners
brought more dense marshes and woodlands into
cultivation.
The great land estates of the English society
largely remained intact and many wealthy land
owners aggressively increased the size of their
holdings, a precondition for increased productivity.
Marriages between the children of landowners also
increased the size of land estates. Primogeniture
(the full inheritance of land by the eldest son)
helped prevent land from being subdivided.
Younger sons of independent land owners left the
family and went to find other respective locations.
Larger farms were conducive more to
commercialized farming at the time when an
expanding population pushed up demand and
prices. Farmland owners turned part of their land
into pasture land for sheep in order to adapt to
developing woollen trade.
Some of the great land owners as well as Yeomen
(farmers whose holdings and security of land
tenure guaranteed their prosperity and status),
organized their holdings in the interest efficiency.
Many farmers selected crops for sales in growing
London market. In their quest for greater profits,
many land owners put their squeeze on their
tenants. Between 1580 and 1620 land lords raised
rents and altered conditions of land tenure in their
favor, preferring shorter phases and forcing tenants
to pay an entry fee before agreeing to rent them
land. Landlords evicted those who could not afford
annual, more onerous terms. But they also pushed
tenants toward more productive farming methods,
including crop rotation.
England's exceptional economic development also
drew the country's natural resources, including iron,
timber, and coal, extracted in far greater quantity
than elsewhere in the continent. New industrial
development expanded the production of iron and
pewter in and around the city of Birmingham.
But above all textile manufacturing transformed
English economy. Woolens, which accounted for
eighty percent of the exports, worsteds (sturdy yarn
spun from combed wool fibers), and other cloth
found eager buyers in England as well as in the
continent. Moreover, late in the sixteenth century
as English merchants began making forays across
the Atlantic these textiles were also sold in the
Americas. Cloth manufacturers undercut production
by urban craftspeople by "putting out" work to the
villages and farms of the countryside. In such
domestic industry poor rural women could spin and
make cading (combing fibers in preparation for
spin) in their homes.
The English textile trade was closely tied to
Antwerp, in the Spanish Netherlands, where
workers dyed English cloth. The entrepreneur Sir
Thomas Gresham became England's
representative there. He so enhanced the
reputation of English business in that region that
English merchants could operate on credit---the
most prominent achievement for sixteenth century.
He also advised the government to explore the
economic possibilities of Americas, which led to the
first concerted efforts at colonization, undertaken
with commercial profits in mind.
208
51 – 1 Memphis: United Egypt's First Capital
The city of Memphis, located on the Nile near the
modern city of Cairo, was founded around 3100
B.C. as the first capital of a recently united Egypt.
The choice of Memphis by Egypt's first kings
reflects the site's strategic importance. First, and
most obvious, the apex of the Nile River delta was
a politically opportune location for the state's
administrative center, standing between the united
lands of Upper and Lower Egypt and offering ready
access to both parts of the country. The older
predynastic (pre-3100 B.C.) centers of power, This
and Hierakonpolis, were too remote from the vast
expanse of the delta, which had been incorporated
into the unified state. Only a city within easy reach
of both the Nile valley to the south and the more
spread out, difficult terrain to the north could
provide the necessary political control that the
rulers of early dynastic Egypt (roughly 3000-2600
B.C.) required.
The region of Memphis must have also served as
an important node for transport and
communications, even before the unification of
Egypt. The region probably acted as a conduit for
much, if not all, of the river-based trade between
northern and southern Egypt. Moreover,
commodities (such as wine, precious oils, and
metals) imported from the Near East by the royal
courts of predynastic Upper Egypt would have
been channeled through the Memphis region on
their way south. In short, therefore, the site of
Memphis offered the rulers of the Early Dynastic
Period an ideal location for controlling internal trade
within their realm, an essential requirement for a
state-directed economy that depended on the
movement of goods.
Equally important for the national administration
was the ability to control communications within
Egypt. The Nile provided the easiest and quickest
artery of communication and the national capital
was, again, ideally located in this respect. Recent
geological surveys of the Memphis region have
revealed much about its topography in ancient
times. It appears that the location of Memphis may
have been even more advantageous for controlling
trade, transport, and communications than was
previously appreciated. Surveys and drill cores
have shown that the level of the Nile floodplain has
steadily risen over the last five millenniums. When
the floodplain was much lower, as it would have
been in predynastic and early dynastic times, the
outwash fans (fan-shaped deposits of sediments)
of various wadis (stream-beds or channels that
carry water only during rainy periods) would have
been much more prominent features on the east
bank. The fan associated with the Wadi Hof
extended a significant way into the Nile floodplain,
forming a constriction in the vicinity of Memphis.
The valley may have narrowed at this point to a
mere three kilometers, making it the ideal place for
controlling river traffic.
Furthermore, the Memphis region seems to have
been favorably located for the control not only of
river-based trade but also of desert trade routes.
The two outwash fans in the area gave access to
the extensive wadi systems of the eastern desert.
In predynastic times, the Wadi Digla may have
served as a trade route between the Memphis
region and the Near East, to judge from the
unusual concentration of foreign artifacts found in
the predynastic settlement of Maadi. Access to,
and control of, trade routes between Egypt and the
Near East seems to have been a preoccupation of
Egypt’s rulers during the period of state formation.
The desire to monopolize foreign trade may have
been one of the primary factors behind the political
unification of Egypt. The foundation of the national
capital at the junction of an important trade route
with the Nile valley is not likely to have been
accidental. Moreover, the Wadis Hof and Digla
provided the Memphis region with accessible
desert pasturage. As was the case with the cities of
Hierakonpolis and Elkab, the combination within
the same area of both desert pasturage and alluvial
arable land (land suitable for growing crops) was a
particularly attractive one for early settlement; this
combination no doubt contributed to the prosperity
of the Memphis region from early predynastic
times.
209
54 – 4 Documenting the Incas
The Incans ruled a vast empire in western South
America when the Spaniards encountered them in
the sixteenth century. Although the Incas had no
writing system of their own, historical information
about Incas is available to researchers because
early Spaniards wrote documents about them.
However, there are drawbacks to use the written
record. First, the Spanish writers were describing
activities and institutions that were very different
from their own, but they often described Inca
culture in terms of their own society. As an
example, consider the list of kings given by the
Incas. As presented in the historical chronology,
Spanish sources indicate there were thirteen kings
who ruled sequentially. The names were given to
them by Inca informants.
However, one school of thought in Inca studies
suggests that the names were not actual people,
but, rather, titles filled by different individuals. Thus,
the number of actual kings may have been fewer,
and several titles may have been filled at the same
time. The early Spanish writers, being unfamiliar
with such a system of titles, simply translated it into
something they were familiar with (a succession of
kings). Given that the Inca empire expanded only
during the time of the last four kings, or as a result
of the actions of the individuals in those four
positions, this question is not deemed significant
for an understanding of the Incas. But the example
shows that biases and inaccuracies may have
been introduced inadvertently from the very
beginning of the written Spanish reports about the
Incas. Moreover, early writers often copied
information from each other - so misinformation
was likely to be passed on and accepted as true by
later scholars.
Second, both Spanish writers and Incan informants
sometimes had motives for being deliberately
deceitful. For example, in an effort to gain status in
the Spaniards' eyes, Incas might say that they
formerly had been more important in the Inca
empire than they actually were. Spanish officials as
well were occasionally untruthful when it served
their purposes. For example, Spaniards might
deliberately underreport the productivity of a region
under their authority so they could sell the
additional products and keep the money, rather
than hand it over to the Spanish Crown.
Third, it should be noted that the Spaniards' main
sources of information were the Incas themselves,
often members of the Inca ruling class. Therefore,
what was recorded was the Incas' point of view
about their own history and empire. Some modern
authorities question whether the history of Incas
happened as they said it did. Although some of
their history is certainly more myth than truth,
many, if not most, scholars agree that the history of
the last four Inca kings is probably accurate. The
same is true of other things told to the Spanish
writers: the more recently an event is said to have
occurred, the more likely it is to have actually
happened.
A fourth problem relates to the nature of the Inca
conquests of the other people in the Americas
before the Spanish arrived and how accurate the
accounts of those conquests are - whether related
by the Spaniards or by the Incas on whom they
relied. It was certainly in the Inca's interest to
describe themselves as invincible and just.
However, lacking accounts by conquered people
about their interactions with the Incas, it is
unknown how much of the information of the Inca
conquest as related by the ruling class is factual.
Finally, there is a certain vagueness in the
historical record regarding places and names.
Many Spanish writers listed places they had visited
within the empire, including both provinces and
towns. However, other writers traveling along the
same routes sometimes recounted different lists of
places. In addition, it is difficult to identify the exact
locations of towns and other geographic points of
reference because of the widespread movements
of people over the past five centuries.
For all these reasons, the historical record must be
carefully evaluated to determine whether it is
accurate and to verify the locations of past events.
One approach is to cross-check information from a
number of authors. Another approach is to conduct
archaeological research. Regardless of the
problems, historical documents review some
important information about the Incas.

54 – 1 The Commercialization of Lumber
In nineteenth-century America, practically
everything that was built involved wood. Pine was
especially attractive for building purposes. It is
durable and strong, yet soft enough to be easily
worked with even the simplest of hand tools. It also
floats nicely on water, which allowed it to be
transported to distant markets across the nation.
The central and northern reaches of the Great
Lakes states—Michigan, Wisconsin, and
Minnesota—all contained extensive pine forests as
well as many large rivers for floating logs into the
Great Lakes, from where they were transported
nationwide.
By 1860, the settlement of the American West
along with timber shortages in the East converged
with ever-widening impact on the pine forests of the
Great Lakes states. Over the next 30 years,
lumbering became a full-fledged enterprise in
Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. Newly
formed lumbering corporations bought up huge
tracts of pineland and set about systematically
cutting the trees. Both the colonists and the later
industrialists saw timber as a commodity, but the
latter group adopted a far more thorough and
calculating approach to removing trees. In this
sense, what happened between 1860 and 1890
represented a significant break with the past. No
longer were farmers in search of extra income, the
main source for shingles, firewood, and other wood
products. By the 1870s, farmers and city dwellers
alike purchased forest products from large
manufacturing companies located in the Great
Lakes states rather than chopping wood
themselves or buying it locally.
The commercialization of lumbering was in part the
product of technological change. The early, thick
saw blades tended to waste a large quantity of
wood, with perhaps as much as a third of the log
left behind on the floor as sawdust or scrap. In the
1870s, however, the British-invented band saw,
with its thinner blade, became standard issue in the
Great Lakes states' lumber factories. Meanwhile,
the rise of steam-powered mills streamlined
production by allowing for the more efficient,
centralized, and continuous cutting of lumber.
Steam helped to automate a variety of tasks, from
cutting to the carrying away of waste. Mills also
employed steam to heat log ponds, preventing
them from freezing and making possible year-round
lumber production.
For industrial lumbering to succeed, a way had to
be found to neutralize the effects of the seasons on
production. Traditionally, cutting took place in the
winter, when snow and ice made it easier to drag
logs on sleds or sleighs to the banks of streams.
Once the streams and lakes thawed, workers rafted
the logs to mills, where they were cut into lumber in
the summer. If nature did not cooperate—if the
winter proved dry and warm, if the spring thaw was
delayed—production would suffer. To counter the
effects of climate on lumber production, loggers
experimented with a variety of techniques for
transporting trees out of the woods. In the 1870s,
loggers in the Great Lakes states began sprinkling
water on sleigh roads, giving them an artificial ice
coating to facilitate travel. The ice reduced the
friction and allowed workers to move larger and
heavier loads.
But all the sprinkling in the world would not save a
logger from the threat of a warm winter. Without
snow the sleigh roads turned to mud. In the 1870s,
a set of snowless winters left lumber companies to
ponder ways of liberating themselves from the
seasons. Railroads were one possibility. At first, the
remoteness of the pine forests discouraged
common carriers from laying track. But increasing
lumber prices in the late 1870s combined with
periodic warm, dry winters compelled loggers to
turn to iron rails. By 1887, 89 logging railroads
crisscrossed Michigan, transforming logging from a
winter activity into a year-round one.
Once the logs arrived at a river, the trip
downstream to a mill could be a long and tortuous
one. Logjams (buildups of logs that prevent logs
from moving downstream) were common—at times
stretching for 10 miles—and became even more
frequent as pressure on the northern Midwest
pinelands increased in the 1860s. To help keep the
logs moving efficiently, barriers called booms
(essentially a chain of floating logs) were
constructed to control the direction of the timber. By
the 1870s, lumber companies existed in all the
major logging areas of the northern Midwest.
211
56 – 2 Representative Government in Colonial
North America
Before 1750, colonists in North America had little
occasion to think of themselves as a distinct
people. There was no American government, no
single political organization in which all the colonies
joined to manage their common concerns. There
was not even a wish for such an organization
except among a few eccentric individuals America,
to the people who lived in it, was still a geographic
region, not a frame of mind.
Asked about nationality, the typical American
colonist of 1750 would have said English or British.
In spite of substantial numbers of Dutch, Germans,
and Scotch-Irish, English people and English
institutions prevailed in every colony, and most
colonists spoke of England as home even though
they had never been there. Yet no American
institutions were quite like their counterparts in
England: the heritage of English ideas that went
with these institutions was so rich and varied that
colonists were able to select and develop those
that best suited their situation and forget others that
meanwhile were growing prominent in the mother
country. This variety sometimes led to regional
differences: in some ways New Englanders were
set off from Virginians even more than from people
in England. But some ideas, institutions, and
attitudes became common in all the colonies and
remained uncommon in England. Although colonial
Englishmen were not yet aware that they shared
these Americanisms with one another or that
English people in England did not share them,
many of the characteristic ideas and attitudes that
later distinguished United States nationalism were
already present by the mid-eighteenth century.
English people brought with them to the New World
the political ideas that still give English and
American government a close resemblance. But
American colonists very early developed
conceptions of representative government that
differed from those in England. Representative
government in England originated in the Middle
Ages, when the king called for men to advise him.
They were chosen by their neighbors and informed
the king of his subjects’ wishes. Eventually, their
advice became so compelling that the king could
not reject it, and the representatives of the people,
organized as a legislature known as the House of
Commons, became the most powerful branch of
the English government.
At first, the House of Commons consisted of
representatives from each county, or shire, and
from selected boroughs. Over the centuries many
of these boroughs became ghost towns with only a
handful of inhabitants, and great towns sprang up
where none had existed before. Yet the old
boroughs continued to send members to the House
of Commons, and the new towns sent none.
Moreover, only a fraction of the English population
could participate even in county elections. In order
to vote, a man had to own property that would, if
rented, yield him at least 40 shillings yearly. Few
could meet the test. A number of English people
thought the situation absurd and said so. But
nothing was done to improve it; in fact, a theory
was devised to justify it. A member of the House of
Commons, it was said, represented not the people
who chose him but the whole country, and he was
not responsible for any particular constituency. Not
all Englishmen could vote for representatives, but
all were virtually represented by every member of
the Commons.
The assemblies of American colonial
representatives were more democratic. Although
every colony had property qualifications for voting,
probably the great majority of adult white males
owned enough land to meet them. Moreover, the
system for apportioning representation was more
balanced. New England colonies gave every town
the right to send delegates to the legislature.
Outside New England, the unit of representation
was usually the county. The political organization of
new counties and the extension of representation
seldom kept pace with the rapid advance of
settlement westward, but nowhere was
representation so uneven or irrational as in
England.
American colonists knew nothing of virtual
representation. A colonial representative was
supposed to be an agent of the people who chose
him. He was supposed to look after their interests
first and those of the colony second. In New
England, where town meetings could be called at
any time, people often gathered to tell their
delegate how to vote on a particular issue.

58 – 3 The Rise of Classic Maya Civilization
Prior to the beginning of the Late Preclassic period
in 300 B.c, Maya ceremonial centers of relatively
substantial size had already appeared in Central
America. The ceremonial center was a distinctive
feature of Maya culture, acting as a focus for the
community. Generally speaking, these centers
were not what we would call cities Although they
did consist of a number of large and varied
buildings, they did not have a substantial resident
population. Some scholars have even labeled
these Maya centers “vacant towns” Their
permanent population consisted mainly of rulers,
priests, and their attendants plus a limited number
of artisans. The elite lived in big houses or in
palaces in and around the center. The bulk of the
peasant population lived in much more modest
wood and thatch homes in the areas surrounding
the centers. At certain times of the year, on the
occasion of major religious festivals such as the
one at the time of the planting of their crops,
scholars hypothesize, by analogy to historical and
modern practices, that the peasants would flock to
the centers to observe and participate in the
ceremonies. At other times of the year, some of the
peasants would be called into the centers to help in
the construction of new temples and palaces
dedicated to the glory of the gods and to the
comforts of their earthly representatives, the
priestly rulers. The peasants also would provide the
food to help sustain the elite in the centers.
What the peasants received from the elite was
certainly not as tangible as the services they
provided. In return for food and labor, the peasants
were offered a psychologically and spiritually
secure and ordered world, as well as access to
some trade goods. Apparently, this was enough.
Agriculture in the tropical Maya lowlands was at
best a chancy business even slight shifts in the
onset of the rainy season or the dry season could
mean disaster for that year's harvest. The religion
of the ancient Maya helped the peasants cope with
their precarious lives. If the gods were properly
propitiated, the crops would be good-as would life
in general.
One archaeologist, William Haviland, argues that it
was the centralizing effects of Maya religion that
led to the rise of Classic Maya civilization. He
believes that the religious centers acted as
magnets to peoples living in the surrounding areas.
To support the growing populations around the
centers, Haviland argues, the agricultural systems
became intensified This led to the evolution of a
complex state Haviland believes that as early as
200 B.c., the “vacant" ceremonial centers at Tikal
had begun transformation toward urban centers.
Moreover, by this time or even earlier, other
centers with huge, labor-intensive buildings had
begun to emerge Sites such as Nakbe, El Mirador,
and Lamanai may have approached urban
dimensions in the last few centuries of the first
millennium B.C.
Other scholars attribute the growth of the
ceremonial centers to trade. William Rathje argues
that the basic cause for the rise of Maya civilization
was the necessity for the Maya, who lived in
resource-poor lowlands, to trade with adjacent
highlanders for materials such as obsidian (a rock
used to make ornaments and cutting edges), salt,
and hard stone for grinding implements. Rathje
maintains that lowland sites such as Tikal, which
were quite distant from the highland resource
areas, were made bigger and architecturally
magnificent to attract highland merchants and their
trade. In order to undertake all the building, the
elite had to attract more artisans and bring more
laborers into the community to do the work. These
population increases led in turn to even more
building, population growth, greater population
density, greater social differentiation, and
occupational specialization. Critics have argued,
however, that there were local substitutes for the
external “necessities'’ and that foreign trade was
present well before the rise of complex
architecture.
Yet other factors beyond ideology and trade must
have been important in the emerging Classic Maya
civilization. Competition among the growing
number of centers may also have played a key role
in the growth of social, economic, and political
complexity, as the organization of the centers grew
to meet the pressures of other centers for new
agricultural land and control of rising populations.

60 – 4 A Model of Urban Expansion
In the early twentieth century, the science of
sociology found supporters in the United States
and Canada partly because the cities there were
growing so rapidly. It often appeared that North
American cities would be unable to absorb all the
new comers arriving in such large numbers.
Presociological thinkers like Frederick Law
Olmsted, the founder of the movement to build
parks and recreation areas in cities, and Jacob
Riis, an advocate of slum reform, urged the nation's
leaders to invest in improving the urban
environment, building parks and beaches, and
making better housing available to all. These
reform efforts were greatly aided by sociologists
who conducted empirical research on the social
conditions in cities. In the early twentieth century,
many sociologists lived in cities like Chicago that
were characterized by rapid population growth and
serious social problems. It seemed logical to use
empirical research to construct theories about how
cities grow and change in response to major social
forces as well as more controlled urban planning.
The founders of the Chicago school of sociology,
Robert Park and Ernest Burgess, attempted to
develop a dynamic model of the city, one that
would account not only for the expansion of cities
in terms of population and territory but also for the
patterns of settlement and land use within cities.
They identified several factors that influence the
physical form of cities. As Park stated, among them
are "transportation and communication, tramways
and telephones, newspapers and advertising, steel
construction and elevators—all things, in fact,
which tend to bring about at once a greater mobility
and a greater concentration of the urban
populations."
Park and Burgess based their model of urban
growth on the concept of "natural areas"—that is,
areas such as occupational suburbs or residential
enclaves in which the population is relatively
homogeneous and land is used in similar ways
without deliberate planning. Park and Burgess saw
urban expansion as occurring through a series of
"invasions" of successive zones or areas
surrounding the center of the city. For example,
people from rural areas and other societies
"invaded" areas where housing was inexpensive.
Those areas: ended to be close to the places
where they worked. In turn, people who could
afford better housing and the cost of commuting
"invaded" areas farther from the business district.
Park and Burgess's model has come to be known
as the "concentric-zone model' (represented by the
figure). Because the model was originally based on
studies of Chicago, its center is labeled "Loop," the
term commonly applied to that city's central
commercial zone. Surrounding the central zone is a
"zone in transition," an area that is being invaded
by business and light manufacturing. The third
zone is inhabited by workers who do not want to
live in the factory or business district but at the
same time need to live reasonably close to where
they work. The fourth or residential zone consists of
upscale apartment buildings and single-family
homes. And the outermost ring, outside the city
limits, is the suburban or commuters' zone; its
residents live within a 30- to 60-minute ride of the
central business district.
Studies by Park, Burgess, and other Chicagoschool sociologists showed how new groups of
immigrants tended to be concentrated in separate
areas within inner-city zones, where sometimes
experienced tension with other ethnic groups that
had arrived earlier. Over time, however, each group
was able to adjust to life in the city and to find a
place for itself in the urban economy. Eventually
many of the immigrants moved to unsegregated
areas in outer zones; the areas they left behind
were promptly occupied by new waves of
immigrants.
The Park and Burgess model of growth in zones
and natural areas of the city can still be used to
describe patterns of growth in cities that were built
around a central business district and that continue
to attract large numbers of immigrants. But this
model is biased toward the commercial and
industrial cities of North America, which have
tended to form around business centers rather than
around palaces or cathedrals, as is often the case
in some other parts of the world. Moreover, it fails
to account for other patterns of urbanization, such
as the rapid urbanization that occurs along
commercial transportation corridors and the rise of
nearby satellite cities.

63 – 1 The Sumerians and Regional
Interdependence
With the emergence of the Sumerian civilization in
about 3100 B.C., a new era in human experience
began-one in which the economic, political, and
social mechanisms created by humans began to
affect the lives of cities, towns, and villages located
hundreds and perhaps thousands of miles apart. In
a real sense, a rapidly evolving world system linked
hundreds of Southwest Asian societies all the way
from modern-day eastern Iran to the eastern
Mediterranean and the Nile Valley. This nascent
world system developed as a result of insatiable
demands for nonlocal raw materials in different
ecological regions where societies were developing
along very similar evolutionary tracks toward
greater complexity. In each area, social
developments and technological innovations were
triggered not only by basic economic needs but
also by the competitive instincts of newly urbanized
elites, who used lavish display and exotic luxuries
to reaffirm their social prestige and authority.
Sumerian civilization is a mirror of this developing
regional interdependence.
Sumerian civilization came into being as a result of
a combination of environmental and social factors.
The Sumerians lived in a treeless, lowland
environment with fertile soils but no metal little
timber, and no semiprecious stones. They obtained
these commodities by trading with areas where
such items were in abundance. Sumerian rulers
controlled not only large grain surpluses that could
be moved in river craft but also a flourishing
industry in textiles and other luxuries. The trade
moved up and down the great rivers, especially the
placid Euphrates. Ancient overland trade routes
linked the Tigris and Euphrates rivers with the
distant cities and ports in the Levant (eastern
Mediterranean area). Even as early as Sumerian
times, caravans of pack animals joined Anatolia to
the Euphrates, the Levant to Mesopotamia, and
Mesopotamia to isolated towns on the distant
Iranian highlands to the east.
Bronze tech no logy produced tougher-edged,
more durable artifacts that could be used for more
arduous day-to-day tasks. One resulting innovation
was the metal- and wood-tipped plow, an
implement dragged by oxen that was capable of
digging a far deeper furrow than the simple hoes
and digging sticks of earlier times. The plow was
developed as irrigation agriculture assumed greater
importance in Sumer, and the combined
innovations increased agricultural yields
dramatically. These yields not only supported larger
urban and rural populations but also provided a
means for the rulers of city-states both in Sumer
and farther afield to exercise more control over
food surpluses and over the wealth obtained by
long-distance exchange.
An intricate and ever-changing system of political
alliances and individual obligations of friendship
linked community with community and city-state
with city-state. In time, financial and logistical
checks and balances were maintained by an
administrative system based in the temples to bring
order to what had begun as in formal bartering.
Specialized merchants began to handle such
commodities as copper and lapis lazuli, a
semiprecious stone. There was wholesaling and
contracting, loans were floated, and individual profit
was a prime motivation Increasingly, every citystate, and even entire civilizations, came to depend
on the world system, not so much for political
stability but for survival.
As the volume of long-distance trade increased
dramatically, so competition over resources
intensified. Each state raised an army to defend its
water rights, trade routes, and city walls. The
onerous tasks of defense and military organization
passed to despotic kings supposedly appointed by
the gods. Such Sumerian city-states as Erech,
Kish, and Ur had periods of political strength and
prosperity when they dominated their neighbors.
Then, just as swiftly, the tide of their fortunes would
change and they would sink into obscurity.
Inevitably, the ambitions of some proud Sumerian
leaders led them to entertain bolder visions than
merely the control of a few city-states in the
lowlands. They were well aware that the control of
lucrative sources of raw materials and trade routes
was the secret of vast political power. In about
2400 B.c., a monarch named Lugalzagesi boasted
of overseeing the entire area from the Persian Gulf
to the Mediterranean. This boast was probably
false. It is likely that Sumerian cities dominated the
overland routes that linked Mesopotamia, Anatolia,
and the Levant, but their influence was never
permanent, their control probably illusory.
215
63 – 3 The Roman Empire
After the formation of the Roman Republic in 509 B
C., the Romans expanded the borders of their realm
through near-continuous warfare. At its greatest
extent, in the early second century A.D, the Roman
Empire reached from the Euphrates River in
southwest Asia to Scotland in the West. The vast
territory ringed the Mediterranean Sea-mare nostrum,
or “our sea," the Romans called it. As the Romans
absorbed the peoples they conquered, they imposed
on them a legal, administrative, and cultural structure
that endured for some five centuries-in the eastern
Mediterranean until the fifteenth century AD-and left a
lasting mark on the civilizations that emerged in
Europe.
Conquering and maintaining a vast empire required
not only inspired leadership and tactics but also
careful planning, massive logistical support, and great
administrative skill. Some of Rome's most enduring
contributions to Western civilization-its system of law,
its governmental and administrative structures, and its
sophisticated civil engineering and architecture-reflect
these qualities.
To facilitate the development and administration of
the empire, as well as to make city life comfortable
and attractive to its citizens, the Roman government
undertook building programs of unprecedented scale
and complexity, mandating the construction of central
administrative and legal centers (forums and
basilicas), recreational facilities (racetracks and
stadiums), theaters, public baths, roads, bridges,
aqueducts (bridge-like structures for carrying fresh
water from the mountains), middle-class housing, and
even new towns. To accomplish these tasks without
sacrificing beauty, efficiency, and human well-being,
Roman builders and architects developed rational
plans using easily worked but durable materials and
highly sophisticated engineering methods. The
architect Vitruvius described these accomplishments
in his Ten Books of Architecture.
To move their armies about efficiently, speed
communications between Rome and the farthest
reaches of the empire, and promote commerce, the
Romans built a vast and sophisticated network of
roads and bridges. Many modern European highways
still follow the lines laid down by Roman engineers,
and foundations dating from the Roman era underlie
the streets of many cities Roman bridges are still in
use, and remnants of Roman aqueducts need only
repairs and connecting links to enable them to
function again. The Pont du Gard, near Nimes in
southern France, for example, is a powerful reminder
of Rome’s rapid spread and enduring impact. Entirely
functional, the Roman aqueduct conveys the balance,
proportion, and rhythmic harmony of a great work of
art and fits naturally into the landscape, a reflection of
the Romans’ attitude toward the land.
Despite their sophistication as city-dwellers, Romans
liked to portray themselves as simple country folk who
had never lost their love of nature. The middle
classes enjoyed their town-home gardens, wealthy
city dwellers maintained rural estates, and Roman
emperors had country villas that were both
functioning farms and places of recreation. Wealthy
Romans even brought nature indoors by
commissioning artists to paint landscapes on the
interior walls of their homes.
The Romans particularly admired Greek art.
Historians have even suggested that although Rome
conquered the Greek world, Greek culture conquered
Rome. The Romans used Greek designs and Greek
styles of columns in their architecture, imported Greek
art, and employed Greek artists. In 146 B.C., for
example, they stripped the Greek city of Corinth of its
art treasures and shipped them back to Rome.
Ironically, this love of Greek art was not accompanied
by admiration for its artists. In Rome, as in Greece,
professional artists were generally considered little
more than skilled laborers.
Although the Romans had gods of their own, they
also adopted many Greek gods and myths and
assimilated Greek religious beliefs and practices into
a form of state religion. To these gods they added
their own deified emperors, in part to maintain the
allegiance of the culturally diverse populations of the
empire. Worship of ancient gods mingled with
homage to past rulers, and oaths of allegiance to the
living ruler made the official religion a political dutyincreasingly ritualized, perfunctory, and distant from
the everyday life of the average person. As a result,
many Romans adopted the more personal religious
beliefs of the people they had conquered. These
unauthorized religions flourished, despite occasional
government efforts to suppress them.
216
64 – 3 The Development of Complex Societies
in Ancient Mexico
Between 9,000 and 4,000 years ago, most of
Mexico was inhabited mainly by hunter-foragers
who lived in small bands that moved with the
seasons to exploit cactus fruits, deer herds, nuts,
and the hundreds of other plant and animal species
in their range, depending on the season. Since
these bands were small in size and never stayed in
one place for a sufficient period of time to have
much long-term effect on the plant and animal
populations on which they subsisted, the hunterforagers’ overall impact on their environment was
low. A few groups along the margins of the lake in
the Valley of Mexico may have been sedentary
villagers, as were some groups along the coasts,
and their role in the domestication of plants and
animals and the eventual spread of agriculture is
unclear. Some researchers suggest, however, that
by about 4,000 years ago, maize cob size had
become large enough that people over large areas
of the Mexican highlands could subsist mainly on
maize.
The recent re-dating of some of the supposedly
earliest domesticated maize in Mesoamerica
(Ancient Mexico) to about 3500 B.C. raises the
possibility that initial agriculture evolved out of
intensified foraging by groups of people who were
relatively sedentary, perhaps living all or most of
the year in one or a few places, and that they were
perhaps even in the process of developing social
differences (social hierarchy) that increased the
intensity of their foraging. However, maize was
domesticated, and by whom, maize appears to
have reached sufficient productivity to permit the
village-farming way of life soon after about 2000
B.C., and agricultural communities appeared at
about this time in many different areas.
From the hot, wet coastal lowlands to the arid
Tehuacan Valley, the earliest villages were quite
similar in size and contents. Almost all houses were
built using the wattle-and-daub method-sticks,
branches, and cane were woven in-and-out
between vertical wall poles, then covered with a
mud plaster, which was dried by the hot sun.
Houses, which were seldom larger than four by six
meters, featured thatched roofs and tamped clay
floors on which fine sand was scattered.
Most of the earliest farming communities were tiny
hamlets-villages of ten to twelve houses that were
home to about fifty to sixty people-but some
communities were larger. Most houses that have
been excavated have yielded the same remains,
mainly grinding stones, storage pits, pieces of large
ceramic storage jars, bones of cottontail rabbits,
carbonized maize fragments, and broken pieces of
ceramic charcoal braziers. In addition, ovens,
middens, and graves are very common. While the
proportion of plant and animal foods varied
somewhat, all villages probably grew maize, beans,
squash, peppers, and some other crops, and
hunted deer and rabbits. Each village, or each
extended family, may have had a specialist who did
pressure flaking of stone (to make tools), leatherworking, or a similar craft, and individual villages
may have concentrated on specialties like salt
production, feather-weaving, shell-working. and
grinding stone manufacture.
As in Mesopotamia, China, and elsewhere, the
background to the origins of complex society in
Mesoamerica was a great scatter of relatively
simple agricultural villages in which the mechanics
of producing a reliable, expandable food supply
had been mastered. An early radical break with the
simple village farming tradition of Mesoamerica
occurred in the sweltering lowlands of the South
Gulf Coast of Mexico. Here, beginning at about
1000 B.C., people built massive clay pyramids and
platforms, lived in small town groups of hundreds or
even thousands, intensively farmed a variety of
ecological zones, and produced what is one of the
world's most valued examples of stone sculpture.
These people are known to us as the Olmec, a
name derived from an ancient American word for
rubber-doubtless a reference to the rubber trees
that grow in this area-but a name they themselves
probably did not use. Some scholars have
considered the possibility that the Olmec culture
was the mother culture of all later complex
societies in Mesoamerica and that the Olmec were
directly responsible for transforming their neighbors
by military, political religious, or economic means
into complex societies. Other scholars, however,
have argued convincingly that the Olmec represent
only one of several largely independent cases of
the evolution of social complexity in Mesoamerica.
217
64 – 4 Nineteen-century Politics in the United
States
The development of the modern presidency in the
United States began with Andrew Jackson who
swept to power in 1829 at the head of the
Democratic Party and served until 1837. During his
administration, he immeasurably enlarged the
power of the presidency. "The President is the
direct representative of the American people," he
lectured the Senate when it opposed him. "He was
elected by the people, and is responsible to them."
With this declaration, Jackson redefined the
character of the presidential office and its
relationship to the people.
During Jackson's second term, his opponents had
gradually come together to form the Whig party.
Whigs and Democrats held different attitudes
toward the changes brought about by the market,
banks, and commerce. The Democrats tended to
view society as a continuing conflict between "the
people”-farmers, planters, and workers-and a set of
greedy aristocrats. This "paper money aristocracy"
of bankers and investors manipulated the banking
system for their own profit, Democrats claimed, and
sapped the nation's virtue by encouraging
speculation and the desire for sudden, unearned
wealth. The Democrats wanted the rewards of the
market without sacrificing the features of a simple
agrarian republic. They wanted the wealth that the
market offered without the competitive, changing
society; the complex dealing; the dominance of
urban centers; and the loss of independence that
came with it.
Whigs, on the other hand, were more comfortable
with the market. For them, commerce and
economic development were agents of civilization.
Nor did the Whigs envision any conflict in society
between farmers and workers on the one hand and
businesspeople and bankers on the other.
Economic growth would benefit everyone by raising
national income and expanding opportunity. The
government's responsibility was to provide a wellregulated economy that guaranteed opportunity for
citizens of ability.
Whigs and Democrats differed not only in their
attitudes toward the market but also about how
active the central government should be in people's
lives. Despite Andrew Jackson's inclination to be a
strong President, Democrats as a rule believed in
limited government. Government's role in the
economy was to promote competition by destroying
monopolies' and special privileges. In keeping with
this philosophy of limited government, Democrats
also rejected the idea that moral beliefs were the
proper sphere of government action. Religion and
politics, they believed, should be kept clearly
separate, and they generally opposed humanitarian
legislation.
The Whigs, in contrast, viewed government power
positively. They believed that it should be used to
protect individual rights and public liberty, and that
it had a special role where individual effort was
ineffective. By regulating the economy and
competition, the government could ensure equal
opportunity. Indeed, for Whigs the concept of
government promoting the general welfare went
beyond the economy. In particular, Whigs in the
northern sections of the United States also
believed that government power should be used to
foster the moral welfare of the country. They were
much more likely to favor social-reform legislation
and aid to education.
In some ways the social makeup of the two parties
was similar. To be competitive in winning votes,
Whigs and Democrats both had to have significant
support among farmers, the largest group in
society, and workers. Neither party could win an
election by appealing exclusively to the rich or the
poor. The Whigs, however, enjoyed
disproportionate strength among the business and
commercial classes. Whigs appealed to planters
who needed credit to finance their cotton and rice
trade in the world market, to farmers who were
eager to sell their surpluses, and to workers who
wished to improve themselves. Democrats
attracted farmers isolated from the market or
uncomfortable with it, workers alienated from the
emerging industrial system, and rising
entrepreneurs who wanted to break monopolies
and open the economy to newcomers like
themselves. The Whigs were strongest in the
towns, cities, and those rural areas that were fully
integrated into the market economy, whereas
Democrats dominated areas of semisubsistence
farming that were more isolated and languishing
economically.
218
67 – 2 Human Activity and the Archaeological
Record
Archaeologists distinguish the "cultural" formation
processes of the archaeological record(those
involving some kind of human activity) from the
"natural" formation processes (those involving
nonhuman activity, such as river action disturbing
archaeological material). There are two kinds of
cultural formation processes: those that reflect the
original human behavior and activity before a find
or site became buried and those(such as
looting)that came after burial. Of course, most
major archaeological sites are formed as the result
of a complex sequence of use, burial, and reuse so
that a simple twofold division of cultural formation
processes may not be so simple to apply in
practice, but the distinction is still useful.
Original human behavior is often reflected
archaeologically in at least four major activities. In
the case of a tool, for example, on of the raw
material, (2)manufacture, (3)use, and(4)disposal or
discard when the tool is worn out or broken.The
tool may of course be reworked and recycled, thus
repeating stages 2 and 3.)Similarly, a food crop
such as wheat will be acquired(harvested),
manufactured(processed), used(eaten), and
discarded(digested and the waste products
excreted), although here one might add a common
intermediate stage of storage before use. From the
archaeologist's point of view, the critical factor is
that remains can enter the archaeological record at
any one of these stages. A tool may be lost or
thrown out for being of inferior quality during
manufacture, or a crop may be accidentally burnt
and thus preserved during processing. In order to
reconstruct the original activity accurately it is
therefore crucial to try to understand which of the
stages one is looking at. It may be quite easy to
identify the first stage for stone tools, for instance,
because stone quarries can often be recognized by
deep holes in the ground with piles of associated
waste flakes that survive well. But it is much more
difficult to know beyond reasonable doubt where a
sample of charred plant remains comes from,
whether from an area where harvested wheat was
taken for threshing or from the area where the
grain was eaten. This may also make it difficult to
reconstruct the true plant diet, since certain
activities may favor the preservation of certain
species of plant.
Deliberate burial of valuables or the dead is
another human behavior that has left its mark on
the archaeological record. In times of conflict or
war, people often deposit prized possessions in the
ground, intending to reclaim them at a later date;
but sometimes, for one reason or another, they fail
to do so. These hoards are a prime source of
evidence for certain periods, such as the European
Bronze Age, for which hoards of metal goods are
common, or later Roman Britain, which has yielded
buried treasures of silver and other precious
metals. The archaeologist, however, may not find it
easy to distinguish between hoards originally
intended to be reclaimed and valuables buriedperhaps as offerings to supernatural powers-with
no reclamation intended.
In addition to burial hoards, a major source of
archaeological evidence comes from burial of the
dead, whether in simple graves, elaborate burial
mounds, or giant pyramids, usually with grave
goods such as ceramic vessels or weapons, and
sometimes with painted tomb-chamber walls as in
ancient Mexico or Egypt. The Egyptians indeed
went so far as to mummify their dead-to preserve
them, they hoped, for eternity-as did the Incas of
Peru whose kings were kept in the Temple of the
Sun at Cuzco and brought outside for special
ceremonies.
Human destruction of the archaeological record
might be caused by burials of the kind just
described being dug into earlier deposits. But
people in the past deliberately or accidentally
obliterated traces of their predecessors in
innumerable other ways Rulers often destroyed
monuments or erased inscriptions belonging to
previous chiefs or monarchs. On the other hand,
some human destruction meant to obliterate has
inadvertently preserved material for the
archaeologist to find. Burning, for example, may
not always destroy. Clay daubing and adobe
usually decay, but if a structure has been burned,
the mud is baked to the consistency of a brick.
219
68 – 1 Salt and the Rise of Venice
The city of Venice, on Italy's coastline, achieved
commercial dominance of southern Europe during
the Middle Ages largely because of its extensive
trade in the valuable commodity of salt. At first,
Venice produced its own salt at its Chioggia
saltworks. For a time, its principal competitor in the
region was the town of Cervia, with Venice having
the advantage because Chioggia was more
productive. But Chioggia produced a fine-grained
salt, so when Venetians wanted coarser salt, they
had to import it. Then, in the thirteenth century,
after a series of floods and storms destroyed about
a third of the salt-producing ponds in Chioggia the
Venetians were forced to import even more salt.
That was when the Venetians made an important
discovery. More money could be made buying and
selling salt than producing it. Beginning in 1281,
the government paid merchants a subsidy on salt
landed in Venice from other areas. As a result of
this assistance, shipping salt to Venice became so
profitable that the salt merchants could afford to
ship other goods at prices that undersold their
competitors. Growing fat on the salt subsidy Venice
merchants could afford to send ships to the eastern
Mediterranean, where they picked up valuable
cargoes of Indian spices and sold them in western
Europe at low prices that their non-Venetian
competitors could not afford to offer. That meant
that Venetians were paying extremely high prices
for salt, but they did not mind expensive salt if they
could dominate the spice trade and be leaders in
the grain trade. When grain harvests failed in Italy,
Venice would use its salt income to subsidize grain
imports from other parts of the Mediterranean and
thereby corner the Italian grain market.
Unlike the Chinese salt monopoly, the Venetian
government never owned salt but simply took a
profit from regulating its trade. Enriched by its
share of sales on high-priced salt, the salt
administration could offer loans to finance other
trade. Between the fourteenth and sixteenth
centuries, a period when Venice was a leading port
for grains and spices, 30 to 50 percent of the
tonnage of imports to Venice was in salt. All salt
had to go through government agencies. The salt
administration issued licenses that told merchants
not only how much salt they could export but also
to where and at what price. The salt administration
also maintained Venice's palatial public buildings
and the complex hydraulic system that prevented
the metropolis from washing away. Many of
Venice's grand statues and ornamental buildings
were financed by the salt administration.
Venice carefully built its reputation as a reliable
supplier, and so contracts with the merchant state
were desirable. Venice was able to dictate terms
for these contracts. In 1250, when Venice agreed
to supply Mantua and Ferrara with salt, the contract
stipulated that these cities would not buy salt from
anyone else. This became the model for Venetian
salt contracts. As Venice became the salt supplier
to more and more countries, it needed more and
more salt producers from which to buy. Merchants
financed by the salt administration went farther into
the Mediterranean, buying salt from many distant
sources. Wherever they went, they tried to
dominate the supply, control the saltworks, and
even acquire them if they could.
Venice manipulated markets by controlling
production. In the late thirteenth century, wishing to
raise the world market price, Venice had all
saltworks on the Greek island of Crete destroyed,
and it banned the local production of salt. The
Venetians then brought in all the salt needed for
local consumption, built stores to sell the imported
salt, and paid damages to the owners of the
saltworks. The policy was designed to control
prices and at the same time keep the locals happy.
Aiding its ability to ruthlessly manipulate commerce
and control territory, Venice maintained the ships of
the merchant fleet as a naval reserve and called
them into combat when needed. The Venetian fleet
patrolled the Adriatic Sea, stopped ships, inspected
cargo, and demanded licensing documents to
make sure all commercial traffic was conforming
with its regulations.

70 – 1 The Development of Chinese Dynasties
The centralized dynasties that ruled ancient China
were a product of the terrain and climate of the
Asian continent. China is isolated from the rest of
the Eastern hemisphere by formidable natural
barriers of mountains on the west and southwest
as well as the Gobi Desert on the north. To the
east lies the Pacific Ocean. Although China’s
separation was not total – trade goods, people and
ideas moved back and forth between China, India,
and Central Asia – in many respects its
development was distinctive.
In its formative years, Chinese civilization had been
influenced by the contributing factors of the Yellow
River region – the land of the loess. It is generally
understood that the river running through a vast
area, where the fine and porous soil accounts for
the large silt content in its current, has a constant
tendency to clog its own course and cause dikes to
break and enormous inundations to occur. The
problem cannot be dealt with locally. This
predicament has a historical origin that can be
traced at least to the Spring and Autumn period
(722 – 481 B.C.), when in 652 B.C., Duke Huan of
Qi convened his league of states. A mutual pledge
by all participants is recorded in various sources as
“not to execute improper dikes and not to hinder
the water flow.” The stone inscriptions of his own
achievements erected by the first emperor of the
Qin dynasty (221 – 207 B.C.) are reproduced in
The Records of History. One of the meritorious
deeds that he credited to himself was the
neutralization of the barriers that obstructed water
flows. These and other references are evidence
that China’s political unification, achieved in the
B.C. era had come under the pressing demand for
a coordinated effort in dealing with the flood
problem which over and above technical
considerations has remained in force for the past
2,000 years.
A second factor compelling China to proceed to an
early national unification and to follow it with
political centralization was the effect of monsoon
rain on agriculture. The summer monsoon in China
comes from the direction of the Philippine Sea. It by
itself does not give rain. The moisture in the air
current depends upon winds flowing from west to
east and northeast, lifting it to an altitude to be
cooled, only then does rain come down from
condensation. This climatic arrangement subjects
agricultural drops of the nation to the
synchronization of two sets of variables. When the
two kinds of currents miss each other, drought sets
in. When they repeatedly converge over a specific
area, flood and inundation are the inevitable result.
It is not uncommon for lack of rain and too much
rain simultaneously to victimize two or more parts
of China. Only an enormous empire in control of
vast resources can deal with the situation. The
requirement imposed by the power of nature was
felt too, during the B.C. era. In one ancient text we
read many stories about wars between the
principalities during times of natural disaster. The
scholar Yao Shanyu, working from ancient
summaries, calls attention to the fact that in the
2,117 years under study, 1,621 floods and 1,392
droughts caused damage serious enough to be
reported by the imperial courts.
Further ruling out the possibility of a decentralized
China was the potential threat of nomads. The
traditional line of defense that China erected in the
north along the steppe – a vast grass-covered plain
– customarily referred to as the Great Wall was by
no means fixed. The territories north and west of
the Great Wall, having an annual rainfall of less
than fifteen inches and therefore inadequate for
cultivation, remained a grazing ground for the
nomads. In times of bad weather and in periods of
China’s dynasty, these nomads had a tendency to
execute large-scale invasion. This was a problem
whose cause was so deeply rooted in geography
that the Chinese were not able to solve it merely
through military offensives. Long-term experience
taught them to put the regional and local
government under a strong leader, allowing
national defense to dictate a degree of
homogeneity and uniformity in order to survive.

HUMAN BIOLOGY
18 – 2 The mystery of yawning
According to conventional theory, yawning takes
place when people are bored or sleepy and serves
the function of increasing alertness by reversing,
through deeper breathing, the drop in blood oxygen
levels that are caused by the shallow breathing that
accompanies lack of sleep or boredom.
Unfortunately, the few scientific investigations of
yawning have failed to find any connection
between how often someone yawns and how much
sleep they have had or how tired they are. About
the closest any research that has come to
supporting the tiredness theory is to confirm that
adults yawn more often on weekdays than at
weekends, and that school children yawn more
frequently in their first year at primary school than
they do in kindergarten.
Another flaw of the tiredness theory is that yawning
does not raise alertness or physiological activity, as
the theory would predict. When researchers
measured the heart rate, muscle tension and skin
conductance of people before, during and after
yawning, they did detect some changes in skin
conductance following yawning, indicating a slight
increase in physiological activity. However, similar
changes occurred when the subjects were asked
simply to open their mouths or to breathe deeply.
Yawning did nothing special to their state of
physiological activity. Experiments have also cast
serious doubt on the belief that yawning is
triggered by a drop in blood oxygen or a rise in
blood carbon dioxide. Volunteers were told to think
about yawning while they breathed either normal
air, pure oxygen, or an air mixture with an abovenormal level of carbon dioxide. If the theory was
correct, breathing air with extra carbon dioxide
should have triggered yawning, while breathing
pure oxygen should have suppressed yawning. In
fact, neither condition made any difference to the
frequency of yawning, which remained constant at
about 24 yawns per hour. Another experiment
demonstrated that physical exercise, which was
sufficiently vigorous to double the rate of breathing,
had no effect on the frequency of yawning. Again
the implication is that yawning has little or nothing
to do with oxygen.
A completely different theory holds that yawning
assists in the physical development of the lungs
early in life, but has no remaining biological
function in adults. It has been suggested that
yawning and hiccupping might serve to clear out
the fetuses airways. The lungs of a fetus secrete a
liquid that mixes with its mother’s amniotic fluid.
Babies with congenital blockages that prevent this
fluid from escaping from their lungs are sometimes
born with deformed lungs. It might be that yawning
helps to clear out the lungs by periodically lowering
the pressure in them. According to this theory,
yawning in adults is just a developmental fossil with
no biological function. But, while accepting that not
everything in life can be explained by Darwinian
evolution, there are sound reasons for being
skeptical of theories like this one, which avoid the
issue of what yawning does for adults. Yawning is
distracting, consumes energy and takes time. It is
almost certainly doing something significant in
adults as well as in fetuses. What could it be?
The empirical evidence, such as it is, suggests an
altogether different function for yawning— namely,
that yawning prepares us for a change in activity
level. Support for this theory came from a study of
yawning behavior in everyday life. Volunteers wore
wrist-mounted devices that automatically recorded
their physical activity for up to two weeks: the
volunteers also recorded their yawns by pressing a
button on the device each time they yawned. The
data showed that yawning tended to occur about
15 minutes before a period of increased behavioral
activity. Yawning bore no relationship to sleep
patterns, however. This accords with anecdotal
evidence that people often yawn in situations
where they are neither tired nor bored, but are
preparing for impending mental and physical
activity. Such yawning is often referred to as
“incongruous” because it seems out of place, at
least on the tiredness view: soldiers yawning
before combat, musicians yawning before
performing, and athletes yawning before
competing. Their yawning seems to have nothing
to do with sleepiness or boredom—quite the
reverse—but it does precede a change in activity
level.
222
24 – 2 Breathing during Sleep
Of all the physiological differences in human sleep
compared with wakefulness that have been
discovered in the last decade, changes in
respiratory control are most dramatic. Not only are
there differences in the level of the functioning of
respiratory systems, there are even changes in
how they function. Movements of the rib cage for
breathing are reduced during sleep, making the
contractions of the diaphragm more important. Yet
because of the physics of lying down, the stomach
applies weight against the diaphragm and makes it
more difficult for the diaphragm to do its job.
However, there are many other changes that affect
respiration when asleep.
During wakefulness, breathing is controlled by two
interacting systems. The first is an automatic,
metabolic system whose control is centered in the
brain stem. It subconsciously adjusts breathing rate
and depth in order to regulate the levels of carbon
dioxide (CO2) and oxygen (O2), and the acid-base
ratio in the blood. The second system is the
voluntary, behavioral system. Its control center is
based in the forebrain, and it regulates breathing
for use in speech, singing, sighing, and so on. It is
capable of ignoring or overriding the automatic,
metabolic system and produces an irregular pattern
of breathing.
During NREM (the phase of sleep in which there is
no rapid eye movement) breathing becomes
deeper and more regular, but there is also a
decrease in the breathing rate, resulting in less air
being exchanged overall. This occurs because
during NREM sleep the automatic, metabolic
system has exclusive control over breathing and
the body uses less oxygen and produces less
carbon dioxide. Also, during sleep the automatic
metabolic system is less responsive to carbon
dioxide levels and oxygen levels in the blood. Two
things result from these changes in breathing
control that occur during sleep. First, there may be
a brief cessation or reduction of breathing when
falling asleep as the sleeper waxes and wanes
between sleep and wakefulness and their differing
control mechanisms. Second, once sleep is fully
obtained, there is an increase of carbon dioxide
and a decrease of oxygen in the blood that persists
during NREM.
But that is not all that changes. During all phases of
sleep, several changes in the air passages have
been observed. It takes twice as much effort to
breathe during sleep because of greater resistance
to airflow in the airways and changes in the
efficiency of the muscles used for breathing. Some
of the muscles that help keep the upper airway
open when breathing tend to become more relaxed
during sleep, especially during REM (the phase of
sleep in which there is rapid eye movement).
Without this muscular action, inhaling is like
sucking air out of a balloon — the narrow passages
tend to collapse. Also there is a regular cycle of
change in resistance between the two sides of the
nose. If something blocks the "good" side, such as
congestion from allergies or a cold, then resistance
increases dramatically. Coupled with these factors
is the loss of the complex interactions among the
muscles that can change the route of airflow from
nose to mouth.
Other respiratory regulating mechanisms
apparently cease functioning during sleep. For
example, during wakefulness there is an
immediate, automatic, adaptive increase in
breathing effort when inhaling is made more
difficult (such as breathing through a restrictive face
mask). This reflexive adjustment is totally absent
during NREM sleep. Only after several inadequate
breaths under such conditions, resulting in the
considerable elevation of carbon dioxide and
reduction of oxygen in the blood, is breathing effort
adjusted. Finally, the coughing reflex in reaction to
irritants in the airway produces not a cough during
sleep but a cessation of breathing. If the irritation is
severe enough, a sleeping person will arouse, clear
the airway, then resume breathing and likely return
to sleep.
Additional breathing changes occur during REM
sleep that are even more dramatic than the
changes that occur during NREM. The amount of
air exchanged is even lower in REM than NREM
because, although breathing is more rapid in REM,
it is also more irregular, with brief episodes of
shallow breathing or absence of breathing. In
addition, breathing during REM depends much
more on the action of the diaphragm and much less
on rib cage action.

HUMAN BEING / ANTHROPOLOGY /
PSYCHOLOGY / MEMORY /
ADULTHOOD AND IMMATURITY
06 – 3 Infantile Amnesia
What do you remember about your life before you
were three? Few people can remember anything
that happened to them in their early years. Adults'
memories of the next few years also tend to be
scanty. Most people remember only a few events—
usually ones that were meaningful and distinctive,
such as being hospitalized or a sibling’s birth.
How might this inability to recall early experiences
be explained? The sheer passage of time does not
account for it; adults have excellent recognition of
pictures of people who attended high school with
them 35 years earlier. Another seemingly plausible
explanation—that infants do not form enduring
memories at this point in development—also is
incorrect. Children two and a half to three years old
remember experiences that occurred in their first
year, and eleven month olds remember some
events a year later. Nor does the hypothesis that
infantile amnesia reflects repression—or holding
back—of sexually charged episodes explain the
phenomenon. While such repression may occur,
people cannot remember ordinary events from the
infant and toddler periods either.
Three other explanations seem more promising.
One involves physiological changes relevant to
memory. Maturation of the frontal lobes of the brain
continues throughout early childhood, and this part
of the brain may be critical for remembering
particular episodes in ways that can be retrieved
later. Demonstrations of infants’ and toddlers' longterm memory have involved their repeating motor
activities that they had seen or done earlier, such
as reaching in the dark for objects, putting a bottle
in a doll’s mouth, or pulling apart two pieces of a
toy. The brain’s level of physiological maturation
may support these types of memories, but not ones
requiring explicit verbal descriptions.
A second explanation involves the influence of the
social world on children’s language use. Hearing
and telling stories about events may help children
store information in ways that will endure into later
childhood and adulthood. Through hearing stories
with a clear beginning, middle, and ending children
may learn to extract the gist of events in ways that
they will be able to describe many years later.
Consistent with this view, parents and children
increasingly engage in discussions of past events
when children are about three years old. However,
hearing such stories is not sufficient for younger
children to form enduring memories. Telling such
stories to two year olds does not seem to produce
long-lasting verbalizable memories.
A third likely explanation for infantile amnesia
involves incompatibilities between the ways in
which infants encode information and the ways in
which older children and adults retrieve it. Whether
people can remember an event depends critically
on the fit between the way in which they earlier
encoded the information and the way in which they
later attempt to retrieve it. The better able the
person is to reconstruct the perspective from which
the material was encoded, the more likely that
recall will be successful.
This view is supported by a variety of factors that
can create mismatches between very young
children's encoding and older children's and adults'
retrieval efforts. The world looks very different to a
person whose head is only two or three feet above
the ground than to one whose head is five or six
feet above it. Older children and adults often try to
retrieve the names of things they saw, but infants
would not have encoded the information verbally.
General knowledge of categories of events such as
a birthday party or a visit to the doctor's office helps
older individuals encode their experiences, but
again, infants and toddlers are unlikely to encode
many experiences within such knowledge
structures.
These three explanations of infantile amnesia are
not mutually exclusive; indeed, they support each
other. Physiological immaturity may be part of why
infants and toddlers do not form extremely
enduring memories, even when they hear stories
that promote such remembering in preschoolers.
Hearing the stories may lead preschoolers to
encode aspects of events that allow them to form
memories they can access as adults. Conversely,
improved encoding of what they hear may help
them better understand and remember stories and
thus make the stories more useful for remembering
future events. Thus, all three explanations—
physiological maturation, hearing and producing
stories about past events, and improved encoding
of key aspects of events—seem likely to be
involved in overcoming infantile amnesia.
224
12 – 1 Which Hand Did They Use?
We all know that many more people today are
right-handed than left-handed. Can one trace this
same pattern far back in prehistory? Much of the
evidence about right-hand versus left-hand
dominance comes from stencils and prints found in
rock shelters in Australia and elsewhere, and in
many Ice Age caves in France, Spain, and
Tasmania. When a left hand has been stenciled,
this implies that the artist was right-handed, and
vice versa. Even though the paint was often
sprayed on by mouth, one can assume that the
dominant hand assisted in the operation. One also
has to make the assumption that hands were
stenciled palm downward—a left hand stenciled
palm upward might of course look as if it were a
right hand. Of 158 stencils in the French cave of
Gargas, 136 have been identified as left, and only
22 as right; right-handedness was therefore heavily
predominant.
Cave art furnishes other types of evidence of this
phenomenon. Most engravings, for example, are
best lit from the left, as befits the work of righthanded artists, who generally prefer to have the
light source on the left so that the shadow of their
hand does not fall on the tip of the engraving tool or
brush. In the few cases where an Ice Age figure is
depicted holding something, it is mostly, though not
always, in the right hand.
Clues to right-handedness can also be found by
other methods. Right-handers tend to have longer,
stronger, and more muscular bones on the right
side, and Marcellin Boule as long ago as 1911
noted the La Chapelle-aux-Saints Neanderthal
skeleton had a right upper arm bone that was
noticeably stronger than the left. Similar
observations have been made on other
Neanderthal skeletons such as La Ferrassie I and
Neanderthal itself.
Fractures and other cut marks are another source
of evidence. Right-handed soldiers tend to be
wounded on the left. The skeleton of a 40- or 50-
year-old Nabatean warrior, buried 2,000 years ago
in the Negev Desert, Israel, had multiple healed
fractures to the skull, the left arm, and the ribs.
Tools themselves can be revealing. Long-handed
Neolithic spoons of yew wood preserved in Alpine
villages dating to 3000 B.C. have survived; the
signs of rubbing on their left side indicate that their
users were right-handed. The late Ice Age rope
found in the French cave of Lascaux consists of
fibers spiraling to the right, and was therefore
tressed by a right-hander.
Occasionally one can determine whether stone
tools were used in the right hand or the left, and it
is even possible to assess how far back this feature
can be traced. In stone tool making experiments,
Nick Toth, a right-hander, held the core (the stone
that would become the tool) in his left hand and the
hammer stone in his right. As the tool was made,
the core was rotated clockwise, and the flakes,
removed in sequence, had a little crescent of
cortex (the core’s outer surface) on the side. Toth’s
knapping produced 56 percent flakes with the
cortex on the right, and 44 percent left-oriented
flakes. A left-handed toolmaker would produce the
opposite pattern. Toth has applied these criteria to
the similarly made pebble tools from a number of
early sites (before 1.5 million years) at Koobi Fora,
Kenya, probably made by Homo habilis. At seven
sites he found that 57 percent of the flakes were
right-oriented, and 43 percent left, a pattern almost
identical to that produced today.
About 90 percent of modern humans are righthanded: we are the only mammal with a
preferential use of one hand. The part of the brain
responsible for fine control and movement is
located in the left cerebral hemisphere, and the
findings above suggest that the human brain was
already asymmetrical in its structure and function
not long after 2 million years ago. Among
Neanderthalers of 70,000 – 35,000 years ago,
Marcellin Boule noted that the La Chapelle-auxSaints individual had a left hemisphere slightly
bigger than the right, and the same was found for
brains of specimens from Neanderthal, Gibraltar,
and La Quina.
225
13 – 1 Types of Social Groups
Life places us in a complex web of relationships
with other people. Our humanness arises out of
these relationships in the course of social
interaction. Moreover, our humanness must be
sustained through social interaction—and fairly
constantly so. When an association continues long
enough for two people to become linked together
by a relatively stable set of expectations, it is called
a relationship.
People are bound within relationships by two types
of bonds: expressive ties and instrumental ties.
Expressive ties are social links formed when we
emotionally invest ourselves in and commit
ourselves to other people. Through association
with people who are meaningful to us, we achieve
a sense of security, love, acceptance,
companionship, and personal worth. Instrumental
ties are social links formed when we cooperate with
other people to achieve some goal. Occasionally,
this may mean working with instead of against
competitors. More often, we simply cooperate with
others to reach some end without endowing the
relationship with any larger significance.
Sociologists have built on the distinction between
expressive and instrumental ties to distinguish
between two types of groups: primary and
secondary. A primary group involves two or more
people who enjoy a direct, intimate, cohesive
relationship with one another. Expressive ties
predominate in primary groups; we view the people
as ends in themselves and valuable in their own
right. A secondary group entails two or more
people who are involved in an impersonal
relationship and have come together for a specific,
practical purpose. Instrumental ties predominate in
secondary groups; we perceive people as means
to ends rather than as ends in their own right.
Sometimes primary group relationships evolve out
of secondary group relationships. This happens in
many work settings. People on the job often
develop close relationships with coworkers as they
come to share gripes, jokes, gossip, and
satisfactions.
A number of conditions enhance the likelihood that
primary groups will arise. First, group size is
important. We find it difficult to get to know people
personally when they are milling about and
dispersed in large groups. In small groups we have
a better chance to initiate contact and establish
rapport with them. Second, face-to-face contact
allows us to size up others. Seeing and talking with
one another in close physical proximity makes
possible a subtle exchange of ideas and feelings.
And third, the probability that we will develop
primary group bonds increases as we have
frequent and continuous contact. Our ties with
people often deepen as we interact with them
across time and gradually evolve interlocking habits
and interests.
Primary groups are fundamental to us and to
society. First, primary groups are critical to the
socialization process. Within them, infants and
children are introduced to the ways of their society.
Such groups are the breeding grounds in which we
acquire the norms and values that equip us for
social life. Sociologists view primary groups as
bridges between individuals and the larger society
because they transmit, mediate, and interpret a
society’s cultural patterns and provide the sense of
oneness so critical for social solidarity.
Second, primary groups are fundamental because
they provide the settings in which we meet most of
our personal needs. Within them, we experience
companionship, love, security, and an overall
sense of well-being. Not surprisingly, sociologists
find that the strength of a group’s primary ties has
implications for the group’s functioning. For
example, the stronger the primary group ties of a
sports team playing together, the better their record
is.
Third, primary groups are fundamental because
they serve as powerful instruments for social
control. Their members command and dispense
many of the rewards that are so vital to us and that
make our lives seem worthwhile. Should the use of
rewards fail, members can frequently win by
rejecting or threatening to ostracize those who
deviate from the primary group’s norms. For
instance, some social groups employ shunning (a
person can remain in the community, but others are
forbidden to interact with the person) as a device to
bring into line individuals whose behavior goes
beyond that allowed by the particular group. Even
more important, primary groups define social reality
for us by structuring our experiences. By providing
us with definitions of situations, they elicit from our
behavior that conforms to group-devised meanings.
Primary groups, then, serve both as carriers of
social norms and as enforcers of them.
226
13 – 3 Methods of Studying Infant Perception
In the study of perceptual abilities of infants, a
number of techniques are used to determine
infants’ responses to various stimuli. Because they
cannot verbalize or fill out questionnaires, indirect
techniques of naturalistic observation are used as
the primary means of determining what infants can
see, hear, feel, and so forth. Each of these
methods compares an infant’s state prior to the
introduction of a stimulus with its state during or
immediately following the stimulus. The difference
between the two measures provides the researcher
with an indication of the level and duration of the
response to the stimulus. For example, if a
uniformly moving pattern of some sort is passed
across the visual field of a neonate (newborn),
repetitive following movements of the eye occur.
The occurrence of these eye movements provides
evidence that the moving pattern is perceived at
some level by the newborn. Similarly, changes in
the infant’s general level of motor activity—turning
the head, blinking the eyes, crying, and so forth—
have been used by researchers as visual indicators
of the infant’s perceptual abilities.
Such techniques, however, have limitations. First,
the observation may be unreliable in that two or
more observers may not agree that the particular
response occurred, or to what degree it occurred.
Second, responses are difficult to quantify. Often
the rapid and diffuse movements of the infant make
it difficult to get an accurate record of the number
of responses. The third, and most potent, limitation
is that it is not possible to be certain that the
infant’s response was due to the stimulus
presented or to a change from no stimulus to a
stimulus. The infant may be responding to aspects
of the stimulus different than those identified by the
investigator. Therefore, when observational
assessment is used as a technique for studying
infant perceptual abilities, care must be taken not
to overgeneralize from the data or to rely on one or
two studies as conclusive evidence of a particular
perceptual ability of the infant.
Observational assessment techniques have
become much more sophisticated, reducing the
limitations just presented. Film analysis of the
infant’s responses, heart and respiration rate
monitors, and nonnutritive sucking devices are
used as effective tools in understanding infant
perception. Film analysis permits researchers to
carefully study the infant’s responses over and over
and in slow motion. Precise measurements can be
made of the length and frequency of the infant’s
attention between two stimuli. Heart and respiration
monitors provide the investigator with the number
of heartbeats or breaths taken when a new
stimulus is presented. Numerical increases are
used as quantifiable indicators of heightened
interest in the new stimulus. Increases in
nonnutritive sucking were first used as an
assessment measure by researchers in 1969. They
devised an apparatus that connected a baby’s
pacifier to a counting device. As stimuli were
presented, changes in the infant’s sucking behavior
were recorded. Increases in the number of sucks
were used as an indicator of the infant's attention to
or preference for a given visual display.
Two additional techniques of studying infant
perception have come into vogue. The first is the
habituation-dishabituation technique, in which a
single stimulus is presented repeatedly to the infant
until there is a measurable decline (habituation) in
whatever attending behavior is being observed. At
that point a new stimulus is presented, and any
recovery (dishabituation) in responsiveness is
recorded. If the infant fails to dishabituate and
continues to show habituation with the new
stimulus, it is assumed that the baby is unable to
perceive the new stimulus as different. The
habituation-dishabituation paradigm has been used
most extensively with studies of auditory and
olfactory perception in infants. The second
technique relies on evoked potentials, which are
electrical brain responses that may be related to a
particular stimulus because of where they originate.
Changes in the electrical pattern of the brain
indicate that the stimulus is getting through to the
infant’s central nervous system and eliciting some
form of response.
Each of the preceding techniques provides the
researcher with evidence that the infant can detect
or discriminate between stimuli. With these
sophisticated observational assessment and
electro-physiological measures, we know that the
neonate of only a few days is far more perceptive
than previously suspected. However, these
measures are only “indirect” indicators of the
infant’s perceptual abilities.
227
14 – 1 Children and Advertising
Young children are trusting of commercial
advertisements in the media, and advertisers have
sometimes been accused of taking advantage of
this trusting outlook. The Independent Television
Commission, regulator of television advertising in
the United Kingdom, has criticized advertisers for
“misleadingness”—creating a wrong impression
either intentionally or unintentionally—in an effort to
control advertisers’ use of techniques that make it
difficult for children to judge the true size, action,
performance, or construction of a toy.
General concern about misleading tactics that
advertisers employ is centered on the use of
exaggeration. Consumer protection groups and
parents believe that children are largely illequipped to recognize such techniques and that
often exaggeration is used at the expense of
product information. Claims such as “the best” or
“better than” can be subjective and misleading;
even adults may be unsure as to their meaning.
They represent the advertiser’s opinions about the
qualities of their products or brand and, as a
consequence, are difficult to verify. Advertisers
sometimes offset or counterbalance an
exaggerated claim with a disclaimer—a
qualification or condition on the claim. For example,
the claim that breakfast cereal has a health benefit
may be accompanied by the disclaimer “when part
of a nutritionally balanced breakfast”. However,
research has shown that children often have
difficulty understanding disclaimers: children may
interpret the phrase “when part of a nutritionally
balanced breakfast” to mean that the cereal is
required as a necessary part of a balanced
breakfast. The author George Comstock suggested
that less than a quarter of children between the
ages of six and eight years old understood
standard disclaimers used in many toy
advertisements and that disclaimers are more
readily comprehended when presented in both
audio and visual formats. Nevertheless, disclaimers
are mainly presented in audio format only.
Fantasy is one of the more common techniques in
advertising that could possibly mislead a young
audience. Child-oriented advertisements are more
likely to include magic and fantasy than
advertisements aimed at adults. In a content
analysis of Canadian television, the author Stephen
Kline observed that nearly all commercials for
character toys featured fantasy play. Children have
strong imaginations and the use of fantasy brings
their ideas to life, but children may not be adept
enough to realize that what they are viewing is
unreal. Fantasy situations and settings are
frequently used to attract children’s attention,
particularly in food advertising. Advertisements for
breakfast cereals have, for many years, been found
to be especially fond of fantasy techniques, with
almost nine out of ten including such content.
Generally, there is uncertainty as to whether very
young children can distinguish between fantasy
and reality in advertising. Certainly, rational
appeals in advertising aimed at children are limited,
as most advertisements use emotional and indirect
appeals to psychological states or associations.
The use of celebrities such as singers and movie
stars is common in advertising. The intention is for
the positively perceived attributes of the celebrity to
be transferred to the advertised product and for the
two to become automatically linked in the
audience’s mind. In children’s advertising, the
“celebrities” are often animated figures from
popular cartoons. In the recent past, the role of
celebrities in advertising to children has often been
conflated with the concept of host selling. Host
selling involves blending advertisements with
regular programming in a way that makes it difficult
to distinguish one from the other. Host selling
occurs, for example, when a children’s show about
a cartoon lion contains an ad in which the same
lion promotes a breakfast cereal. The psychologist
Dale Kunkel showed that the practice of host
selling reduced children’s ability to distinguish
between advertising and program material. It was
also found that older children responded more
positively to products in host selling
advertisements.
Regarding the appearance of celebrities in
advertisements that do not involve host selling, the
evidence is mixed. Researcher Charles Atkin found
that children believe that the characters used to
advertise breakfast cereals are knowledgeable about
cereals, and children accept such characters as
credible sources of nutritional information. This finding
was even more marked for heavy viewers of
television. In addition, children feel validated in their
choice of a product when a celebrity endorses that
product. A study of children in Hong Kong, however,
found that the presence of celebrities in
advertisements could negatively affect the children’s
perceptions of a product if the children did not like the
celebrity in question.

21 – 3 Autobiographical Memory
Think back to your childhood and try to identify
your earliest memory. How old were you? Most
people are not able to recount memories for
experiences prior to the age of three years, a
phenomenon called infantile amnesia. The
question of why infantile amnesia occurs has
intrigued psychologists for decades, especially in
light of ample evidence that infants and young
children can display impressive memory
capabilities. Many find that understanding the
general nature of autobiographical memory, that is,
memory for events that have occurred in one’s own
life, can provide some important clues to this
mystery. Between ages three and four, children
begin to give fairly lengthy and cohesive
descriptions of events in their past. What factors
are responsible for this developmental turning
point?
Perhaps the explanation goes back to some ideas
raised by influential Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget
— namely, that children under age two years
represent events in a qualitatively different form
than older children do. According to this line of
thought, the verbal abilities that blossom in the two
year old allow events to be coded in a form
radically different from the action-based codes of
the infant. Verbal abilities of one year olds are, in
fact, related to their memories for events one year
later. When researchers had one year olds imitate
an action sequence one year after they first saw it,
there was correlation between the children’s verbal
skills at the time they first saw the event and their
success on the later memory task. However, even
children with low verbal skills showed evidence of
remembering the event; thus, memories may be
facilitated by but are not dependent on those verbal
skills.
Another suggestion is that before children can talk
about past events in their lives, they need to have a
reasonable understanding of the self as a
psychological entity. The development of an
understanding of the self becomes evident
between the first and second years of life and
shows rapid elaboration in subsequent years. The
realization that the physical self has continuity in
time, according to this hypothesis, lays the
foundation for the emergence of autobiographical
memory.
A third possibility is that children will not be able to
tell their own “life story” until they understand
something about the general form stories take, that
is, the structure of narratives. Knowledge about
narratives arises from social interactions,
particularly the storytelling that children experience
from parents and the attempts parents make to talk
with children about past events in their lives. When
parents talk with children about “what we did today”
or “last week” or “last year”, they guide the
children’s formation of a framework for talking
about the past. They also provide children with
reminders about the memory and relay the
message that memories are valued as part of the
cultural experience. It is interesting to note that
some studies show Caucasian American children
have earlier childhood memories than Korean
children do. Furthermore, other studies show that
Caucasian American mother-child pairs talk about
past events three times more often than do Korean
mother-child pairs. Thus, the types of social
experiences children have do factor into the
development of autobiographical memories.
A final suggestion is that children must begin to
develop a “theory of mind” — an awareness of the
concept of mental states (feelings, desires, beliefs,
and thoughts), their own and those of others —
before they can talk about their own past
memories. Once children become capable of
answering such questions as “What does it mean
to remember?” and “What does it mean to know
something?” improvements in memory seem to
occur.
It may be that the developments just described are
intertwined with and influence one another. Talking
with parents about the past may enhance the
development of the self-concept, for example, as
well as help the child understand what it means to
“remember”. No doubt the ability to talk about one’s
past represents memory of a different level of
complexity than simple recognition or recall.
229
30 – 1 Role of Play in Development
Play is easier to define with examples than with
concepts. In any case, in animals it consists of
leaping, running, climbing, throwing, wrestling, and
other movements, either along, with objects, or with
other animals. Depending on the species, play may
be primarily for social interaction, exercise, or
exploration. One of the problems in providing a
clear definition of play is that it involves the same
behaviors that take place in other circumstances —
dominance, predation, competition, and real
fighting. Thus, whether play occurs or not depends
on the intention of the animals, and the intentions
are not always clear from behaviors alone.
Play appears to be a developmental characteristic
of animals with fairly sophisticated nervous
systems, mainly birds and mammals. Play has
been studied most extensively in primates and
canids (dogs). Exactly why animal’s play is still a
matter debated in the research literature, and the
reasons may not be the same for every species
that plays. Determining the functions of play is
difficult because the functions may be long-term,
with beneficial effects not showing up until the
animal’s adulthood.
Play is not without considerable costs to the
individual animal. Play is usually very active,
involving movement in space and, at times,
noisemaking. Therefore, it results in the loss of fuel
or energy that might better be used for growth or
for building up fat stores in a young animal.
Another potential cost of this activity is greater
exposure to predators since play is attentiongetting behavior. Great activities also increase the
risk of injury in slipping or falling.
The benefits of play must outweigh costs, or play
would not have evolved, according to Darwin’s
theory. Some of the potential benefits relate directly
to the healthy development of the brain and
nervous system. In one research study, two groups
of young rats were raised under different
conditions. One group developed in an “enriched”
environment, which allowed the rats to interact with
other rats, play with toys, and receive maze
training. The other group lived in an “impoverished”
environment in individual cages in a dimly lit room
with little stimulation. At the end of the experiments,
the results showed that the actual weight of the
brains of the impoverished rats was less than that
of those raised in the enriched environment
(though they were fed the same diets). Other
studies have shown that greater stimulation not
only affects the size of the brain but also increases
the number of connections between the nerve
cells. Thus, active play may provide necessary
stimulation to the growth of synaptic connections in
the brain, especially the cerebellum, which is
responsible for motor functioning and movements.
Play also stimulates the development of the muscle
tissues themselves and may provide the
opportunities to practice those movements needed
for survival. Prey species, like young deer or goats,
for example, typically play by performing sudden
flight movements and turns, whereas predator
species, such as cats, practice stalking, pouncing,
and biting.
Play allows a young animal to explore its
environment and practice skills in comparative
safety since the surrounding adults generally do
not expect the young to deal with threats or
predators. Play can also provide practice in social
behaviors needed for courtship and mating.
Learning appropriate social behaviors is especially
important for species that live in groups, like young
monkeys that needed to learn to control selfishness
and aggression and to understand the give-andtake involved in social groups. They need to learn
how to be dominant and submissive because each
monkey might have to play either role in the future.
Most of these things are learned in the long
developmental periods that primates have, during
which they engage in countless play experiences
with their peers.
There is a danger, of course, that play may be
misinterpreted or not recognized as play by others,
potentially leading to aggression. This is especially
true when play consists of practicing normal
aggressive or predator behaviors. Thus, many
species have evolved clear signals to delineate
playfulness. Dogs, for example, will wag their tails,
get down their front legs, and stick their behinds in
the air to indicate “what follows is just for play”.
230
31 – 2 Early Childhood Education
Preschools - educational programs for children
under the age of five - differ significantly from one
country to another according to the views that
different societies hold regarding the purpose of
early childhood education. For instance, in a crosscountry comparison of preschools in China, Japan,
and the United States, researchers found that
parents in the three countries view the purpose of
preschools very differently. Whereas parents in
China tend to see preschools primarily as a way of
giving children a good start academically,
Japanese parents view them primarily as a way of
giving children the opportunity to be members of a
group. In the United States, in comparison, parents
regard the primary purpose of preschools as
making children more independent and self-reliant,
although obtaining a good academic start and
having group experience are also important.
While many programs designed for preschoolers
focus primarily on social and emotional factors,
some are geared mainly toward promoting
cognitive gains and preparing preschoolers for the
formal instruction they will experience when they
start kindergarten. In the United States, the bestknown program designed to promote future
academic success is Head Start. Established in the
1960s when the United States declared the War on
Poverty, the program has served over 13 million
children and their families. The program, which
stresses parental involvement, was designed to
serve the "whole child", including children's
physical health, self-confidence, social
responsibility, and social and emotional
development.
Whether Head Start is seen as successful or not
depends on the lens through which one is looking.
If, for instance, the program is expected to provide
long-term increases in IQ (intelligence quotient)
scores, it is a disappointment. Although graduates
of Head Start programs tend to show immediate IQ
gains, these increases do not last. On the other
hand, it is clear that Head Start is meeting its goal
of getting preschoolers ready for school.
Preschoolers who participate in Head Start are
better prepared for future schooling than those who
do not. Furthermore, graduates of Head Start
programs have better future school grade. Finally,
some research suggests that ultimately Head Start
graduates show higher academic performance at
the end of high school, although the gains are
modest.
In addition, results from other types of preschool
readiness programs indicate that those who
participate and graduate are less likely to repeat
grades, and they are more likely to complete school
than readiness program, for every dollar spent on
the program, taxpayers saved seven dollars by the
time the graduates reached the age of 27.
The most recent comprehensive evaluation of early
intervention programs suggests that, taken as a
group, preschool programs can provide significant
benefits, and that government funds invested early
in life may ultimately lead to a reduction in future
costs. For instance, compared with children who
did not participate in early intervention programs,
participants in various programs showed gains in
emotional or cognitive development, better
educational outcomes, increased economic selfsufficiency, reduced levels of criminal activity, and
improved health-related behaviors. Of course, not
every program produced all these benefits, and not
every child benefited to the same extent.
Furthermore, some researchers argue that lessexpensive programs are just as good as relatively
expensive ones, such as Head Start. Still, the
results of the evaluation were promising,
suggesting that the potential benefits of early
intervention can be substantial.
Not everyone agrees that programs that seek to
enhance academic skills during the preschool
years are a good thing. In fact, according to
developmental psychologist David Elkind, United
States society tends to push children so rapidly that
they begin to feel stress and pressure at a young
age. Elkind argues that academic success is
largely dependent upon factors out of parents'
control, such as inherited abilities and a child's rate
of maturation. Consequently, children of a
particular age cannot be expected to master
educational material without taking into account
their current level of cognitive development. In
short, children require development appropriate
educational practice, which is education that is
based on both typical development and the unique
characteristics of a given child.
231
35 – 2 The Development of Social Complexity
For most of human history, we have foraged
(hunted, fished, and collected wild plants) for food.
Small nomadic groups could easily supply the
necessities for their families. No one needed more,
and providing for more than one’s needs made little
sense. The organization of such societies could be
rather simple, revolving around age and gender
categories. Such societies likely were largely
egalitarian, beyond distinctions based on age and
gender, virtually all people had equivalent rights,
status, and access to resources.
Archaeologist Donald Henry suggests that the
combination of a rich habitat and sedentism
(permanent, year-round settlement) led to a
dramatic increase in human population. In his view,
nomadic, simple foragers have relatively low levels
of fertility. Their high-protein, low-carbohydrate
diets result in low body-fat levels, which are
commonly associated with low fertility in women.
High levels of physical activity and long periods of
nursing, which are common among modern simple
foragers, probably also contributed to low levels of
female fertility if they were likewise common among
ancient foragers.
In Henry's view, the adoption of a more settled
existence in areas with abundant food resources
would have contributed to higher fertility levels
among the sedentary foragers. A diet higher in wild
cereals produces proportionally more body fat,
leading to higher fertility among women. Cereals,
which are easy to digest, would have
supplemented and then replaced mother's milk as
the primary food for older infants. Since women are
less fertile when they are breast-feeding,
substituting cereals for mother's milk would have
resulted in closer spacing of births and the potential
for a greater number of live births for each woman.
A more sedentary existence may also have
lowered infant mortality and perhaps increased
longevity among the aged. These more vulnerable
members of society could safely stay in a fixed
village rather than be forced regularly to move
great distances as part of a nomadic existence,
with its greater risk of accidents and trauma.
All of these factors may have resulted in a trend of
increasing size among some local human
populations in the Holocene (since 9600 B C E).
Given sufficient time, even in very rich habitats,
human population size can reach carrying capacity,
the maximum population an area can sustain within
the context of a given subsistence system. And
human population growth is like a runaway tram
once it picks up speed, it is difficult to control. So
even after reaching an area’s carrying capacity,
Holocene human populations probably continued to
grow in food-rich regions, overshooting the ability
of the territory to feed the population, again within
the context of the same subsistence strategy. In
some areas, small changes in climate or minor
changes in plant characteristics may have further
destabilized local economies.
One possible response to surpassing the carrying
capacity of a region is for a group to exploit
adjoining land. However, good land may itself be
limited—for example, within the confines of a river
valley where neighbors are in the same position,
having filled up the whole of the desirable habitat
available in their home territories, expansion is also
problematic. Impinging on the neighbors' territory
can lead to conflict, especially when they too are
up against the capacity of the land to provide
enough food.
Another option is to stay in the same area but to
shift and intensify the food quest there. The
impulse to produce more food to feed a growing
population was satisfied in some areas by the
development of more-complex subsistence
strategies involving intensive labor and requiring
more cooperation and greater coordination among
the increasing numbers of people. This
development resulted in a change in the social and
economic equations that defined those societies.
Hierarchies that did not exist in earlier foraging
groups but that were helpful in structuring
cooperative labor and in organizing more-complex
technologies probably became established, even
before domestication and agriculture, as preNeolithic societies (before the tenth millennium B C
E) reacted to the population increase.
232
62 – 3 Is Perceptual Development an Innate or
Socially Acquired Process?
Most developmental scientists now agree that both
nature (genetics) and nurture (environment) are
essential for the normal development of perception.
However, there is still much dispute about the
extent to which either nature or nurture is the more
important factor. Points of view on this issue are
more than just philosophical musings; they affect
the kinds of experiments that are undertaken. I
argue here that classifying particular aspects of
perceptual development as either innate or learned
presents us with an overly passive view in which
either genes or environment imposes structure on
the developing brain. In contrast, I suggest that
perceptual development is better characterized as
an activity-dependent process involving complex
and subtle interactions at many levels.
To begin to illustrate my point, let's consider some
recent neurobiological work on the prenatal
(before-birth) development of the brain in rodents.
Neurons are specialized cells that transmit
impulses or messages to other neurons, glands,
and muscles. The neurons studied in these
experiments are those involved in binocular vision.
Experiments show that the prenatal tuning
(training) of these neurons arises through their
response to internally generated waves of electrical
activity. In other words, the response properties of
these visual neurons are shaped by a “virtual
environment" generated by cells elsewhere in the
brain and eye. Although the term “innate" can be
stretched to cover this example of development, we
could equally well describe this process as the cells
“learning" from the input provided. Further, after
birth the same neurons continue to be tuned in the
same way except that now their input also reflects
the structure of the world outside. When we
examine development in detail, it becomes harder
to argue, as some theorists do, that “innate
knowledge” is fundamentally different from
learning.
Another example of the role of activity-dependent
processes in perceptual development comes from
the ability to detect and recognize faces. Because
regions of the human brain are specialized for
processing faces, some researchers have argued
that this ability is innate. However, experiments
with infants reveal a more complex story. The
tendency for newborns to look more toward faces
turns out to be based on a very primitive, reflex like
system that is triggered by a stimulus as simple as
three high-contrast blobs in the approximate
locations of the eyes and mouth. This simple bias is
sufficient to ensure that newborns look much more
at faces than at other objects and patterns over the
first weeks of life. One consequence of this is that
developing circuits on the visual recognition
pathway of the brain get more input related to faces
and thus are shaped by experience with this
special type of visual stimulus. We can now study
this process by using new brain-imaging methods.
Such studies have shown that the brains of young
infants show less-localized and less-specialized
processing of faces than do the brains of adults. It
is not until they are one year old that infants show
the same patterns of brain specialization for
processing faces as do adults, by which time they
have had as much as a thousand hours of
exposure to human faces.
Another example comes from the study of
infants’eye movements to visual targets. Although
newborns are capable of some primitive reflexive
eye movements, only much later in the first year
can they make most of the kinds of complex and
accurate eye movements seen in adults. One view
is that the very limited ability present in newborns is
just sufficient to allow them to practice and develop
new brain circuits for the more complex integration
of visual and motor information necessary for adult
eye movements. Once again, it appears that
infants actively contribute to their own subsequent
development.
These considerations should make us skeptical
about the many claims that are made for innate
perceptual abilities based on experiments with
babies of four months and older. In fact, when the
same experiments were done with younger infants,
quite different results have often been obtained,
suggesting dramatic changes in perceptual abilities
over the first few weeks and months after birth.
Infants are not passively shaped by either their
genes or their environment. Rather, perceptual
development is an activity-dependent process in
which, during postnatal life, the infant plays an
active role in generating the experience it needs for
subsequent development.
233
64 – 2 Auditory Perception in Infancy
Because they have had some practice in hearing
before birth, it is not surprising that infants have
reasonably good auditory perception after they are
born. In fact, for certain very high and very low
frequencies, infants actually are more sensitive to
sound than adults-a sensitivity that seems to
increase during the first two years of life. On the
other hand, infants are initially less sensitive than
adults to middle-range frequencies. Eventually,
however, their capabilities within the middle range
improve.
It is not fully clear what leads to the improvement
during infancy in sensitivity to sounds, although it
may be related to the maturation of the nervous
system. More puzzling is why, after infancy,
children's ability to hear very high and low
frequencies gradually declines. One explanation
may be that exposure to high levels of noise may
diminish capacities at the extreme ranges.
In addition to the ability to detect sound, infants
need several other abilities in order to hear
effectively. For instance, sound localization permits
infants to pin point the direction from which a sound
is emanating. Compared to adults, infants have a
slight handicap in this task, because effective
sound localization requires the use of the slight
difference in the times at which a sound reaches
our two ears. Because infants' heads are smaller
than those of adults; the difference in timing of the
arrival of sound at the two ears is less than it is in
adults. However，despite the potential limitation
brought about by their smaller heads, infants'
sound localization abilities are actually fairly good
even at birth, and they reach adult levels of
success by the age of one year. Interestingly, their
improvement is not steady: although we don't know
why, the accuracy of sound localization actually
declines between birth and two months of age, but
then begins to increase.
Even more important to their ultimate success in
the world, young infants are capable of making the
fine discriminations that their future understanding
of language will require. For instance, in one
classic study, a group of one to four-month-old
infants sucked on nipples that activated a recording
of a person saying “ba” every time they sucked. At
first, their interest in the sound made them suck
vigorously. Soon, though, they became acclimated
to the sound and sucked with less energy. On the
other hand, when the experimenters changed the
sound to “pa”, the infants immediately showed new
interest and sucked with greater vigor once again.
The clear conclusion: infants as young as one
month old could make the distinction between the
two similar sounds.
Even more intriguing is the fact that young infants
are able to discriminate certain characteristics that
differentiate one language from another. Some
evidence suggests that even two- day-olds show
preferences for the language spoken by those
around them over other languages. In the first few
months, the ability to discriminate between
languages develops rapidly. By the age of five
months, they can distinguish the difference
between English and Spanish passages, even
when the two are similar in meter, number of
syllables, and speed of recitation.
Given their ability to discriminate a difference in
speech as slight as the difference between two
consonants, it is not surprising that infants can
distinguish different people on the basis of voice. In
fact, from an early age they show clear preferences
for some voices over others. For instance, in one
experiment newborns were allowed to suck a
nipple that turned on a recording of a human voice
reading a story. The infants sucked significantly
Ionger when the voice was that of their mother than
when the voice was that of a stranger.
How do such preferences arise? One hypothesis is
that prenatal exposure to the mother's voice is the
key. As support for this conjecture, researchers
point to the fact that newborns do not show a
preference for their fathers' voices over other male
voices. Furthermore, newborns prefer listening to
melodies sung by their mothers before they were
born to melodies that were not sung before birth. It
seems, then, that the prenatal exposure to their
mothers' voices-although muffled by the liquid
environment of the womb-helps shape infants'
listening preferences.
234
68 – 3 Research into Aging and Extending Life
Span
The mounting evidence for age genes that
influence the aging process is by no means
conclusive, but it is quite impressive,coming from a
variety of independent research from aging in
worms and fruit flies to antioxidants and gene
repair mechanisms, and human mutations. Still, the
connections are circumstantial.
Christopher Wills, professor of biology at the
University of California in San Diego, thinks that by
2025 science will likely isolate the mammalian age
genes in mice. We share roughly 75 percent of our
genes with mice and have much the same body
chemistry; this is a strong reason to believe that an
age gene found in mice could also be at work in
humans. if such genes are located, the next step
would be to find out if these age genes have their
counterparts in humans.Wills believes that if they
are found in humans,they may extend the human
life span perhaps to 150 years.
But by 2020, when personalized DNA sequencing
becomes widespread. a second tactic may prove
fruitful as well. By analyzing populations of healthy
individuals in their nineties and beyond, scientists
will find it possible to use computers to compare
their genetic backgrounds and cross-check for
similarities in key genes that are suspected of
influencing aging. A combination of studies on the
DNA of long-lived animals and on the personalized
DNA sequences of elderly individuals may
considerably narrow down the search for the age
gene.
As yet, none of these methods can prove that we
can increase the human life span. Indeed, the only
theory with a proven track record of extending the
life span of animals is the caloric restriction theory,
which states that animals which consume calories
just above starvation levels live significantly longer
than the average. Although this theory flies in the
face of common sense (a well-fed animal is well
nourished and healthy, and should have greater
resistance to disease and aging),it has held up
under repeated testing among a wide range of
animals. Scientists have consistently increased the
life span of rats and mice in the laboratory by 50 to
100 percent.it is the only laboratory-tested theory of
age extension for animals that has held up under
decades of careful scrutiny, Why?
Across the animal kingdom, the life span of animals
is roughly inversely correlated to the metabolism
rate. The slower their normal metabolism rate, the
longer their normal life span. In 1996,in a study that
reduced the calore intake of 200 monkeys by 30
percent,the monkeys were shown to have a slower
metabolism rate,a longer life span,and reduced
rates of cancer, heart disease, and diabetes. "We
have known for 70 years that if you feed laboratory
mice less food, they age slower, they live longer,
and they get diseases less freauently. We find that
monkevs respond in the same wav as rodents and
that the same biological changes may be in play
here," says George Roth of the National Institute of
Aging.
There is still room for scientific debate on the
question "why?" Ron Hart, a scientist at the
National Center for Toxicological
Research,believes that the answer may lie in the
high body temperature of mammals,and humans in
particular.“Heat causes pieces of the DNA
molecule to split off randomly, and it must be
repaired," Hart says "Under calorie
restriction,though,the engine runs cooler and
there's less damage. Merely reducing caloric intake
by 40 percent reduced this form of spontaneous
DNA damage almost 24 percent!" Furthermore, at
a higher internal body temperature, oxygen is being
burned at a greater rate, creating more free
radicals, which also speed up the aging process.
Cooling the body,on the other hand, increases the
amount of antioxidants in the body. Hart found a
fourfold increase in the enzyme catalase and a
threefold increase in superoxidew dismutase in
animals on a restricted diet."What's
fascinating,"Hart concludes,"is that reduced food
intake is the only experimental paradigm ever
found that enhances DNA repair." Hart is so
convinced of the importance of this work that in
1993 he began the first systematic studies of
caloric restrictions in humans.
235
70 – 3 Functionalism
In biology, different parts of an organism may be
described by their functions or the parts they play
in maintaining the life of the whole organism.
Functionalism in social science similarly looks for
the role (function) some aspect of culture or social
life plays in maintaining a system. Two quite
different schools of functionalism arose in
conjunction with two British anthropologists –
Bronislaw Malinowski (1884 – 1942) and A.R.
Radcliffe-Brown(1881 – 1955).
Malinowski’s version of functionalism assumes that
all cultural traits serve the needs of individuals in a
society – that the function of a cultural trait is its
ability to satisfy some basic or derived need of the
members of the group. The basic needs include
nutrition reproduction, bodily comfort, safety,
relaxation movement, and growth. Some aspects of
the culture satisfy these basic needs. In doing so,
they give rise to derived needs that must also be
satisfied. For example, cultural traits that satisfy the
basic need for food give rise to the secondary or
derived need for cooperation in food collection or
production. Societies will in turn develop forms of
political organization and social control that
guarantee the required cooperation. How did
Malinowski explain such things as religion and
magic? He suggested that since humans always
live with a certain amount of uncertainty and
anxiety, they need stability and continuity. Religion
and magic are functional in that they serve those
needs.
Unlike Malinowski, Radcliffe-Brown felt that the
various aspects of social behavior maintain a
society’s social structure rather than satisfying
individual needs. By social structure he meant the
total network of existing social relationships in a
society. Since Radcliffe-Brown’s version of
functionalism emphasized the social structure as
the system to be maintained through the
development of supporting rules, practices, and
customs, the term “structural functionalism” is often
used to describe his approach.
An example of Radcliffe-Brown’s structuralfunctionalist approach is his analysis of the ways in
which different societies deal with the tensions that
are likely to develop among people related through
marriage. To reduce potential tension between inlaws, he suggested societies do one of two things.
They may develop strict rules forbidding the
persons involved ever to interact face to face (as
do the Navajos, for example, in requiring a man to
avoid his motherin-law) or they may allow mutual
disrespect and teasing between the in-laws.
Radcliffe-Brown suggested that avoidance is likely
to occur between in-laws of different generations,
whereas disrespectful teasing is likely between inlaws of the same generation. Both avoidance and
teasing he suggested, are ways to avoid real
conflict and help maintain the social structure.
The major objection to Malinowski’s functionalism
is that it cannot readily account for cultural
variation. Most of the needs he identified – such as
the need for food – are universal, all societies must
deal with them if they are to survive. Thus, while
the functionalist approach may tell us why all
societies engage in food getting, it cannot tell why
different societies have different food-getting
practices. In other words, functionalism does not
explain why certain specific cultural patterns arise
to fulfill a need that might be fulfilled just as easily
by any of a number of alternative possibilities.
A major problem of the structural-functionalist
approach is that it is difficult to determine whether a
particular custom is in fact functional in the sense
of contributing to the maintenance of the social
system. In biology the contribution an organ makes
to the health or life of an animal can be assessed
by removing it. But we cannot subtract a cultural
trait from a society to see if the trait really does
contribute to the maintenance of the group. It is
conceivable that certain customs within the society
may be neutral or even detrimental to its
maintenance. We cannot assume that all of a
society’s customs are functional merely because
the society is functioning at the moment. And even
if we are able to assess whether a particular
custom is functional, this theoretical orientation fails
to deal with the question of why a particular society
chooses to meet its structural needs in a particular
way. A given problem does not necessarily have
only one solution. We still must explain why one of
the possible solutions is chose.

JOB / CAREER
09 – 2 Reflection in Teaching
Teachers, it is thought, benefit from the practice of
reflection, the conscious act of thinking deeply
about and carefully examining the interactions and
events within their own classrooms. Educators T.
Wildman and J. Niles (1987) describe a scheme for
developing reflective practice in experienced
teachers. This was justified by the view that
reflective practice could help teachers to feel more
intellectually involved in their role and work in
teaching and enable them to cope with the paucity
of scientific fact and the uncertainty of knowledge
in the discipline of teaching.
Wildman and Niles were particularly interested in
investigating the conditions under which reflection
might flourish – a subject on which there is little
guidance in the literature. They designed an
experimental strategy for a group of teachers in
Virginia and worked with 40 practicing teachers
over several years. They were concerned that
many would be “drawn to these new, refreshing”
conceptions of teaching only to find that the void
between the abstractions and the realities of
teacher reflection is too great to bridge. Reflection
on a complex task such as teaching is not easy.
The teachers were taken through a program of
talking about teaching events, moving on to
reflecting about specific issues in a supported, and
later an independent, manner.
Wildman and Niles observed that systematic
reflection on teaching required a sound ability to
understand classroom events in an objective
manner. They describe the initial understanding in
the teachers with whom they were working as
being “utilitarian … and not rich or detailed enough
to drive systematic reflection.” Teachers rarely
have the time or opportunities to view their own or
the teaching of others in an objective manner.
Further observation revealed the tendency of
teachers to evaluate events rather than review the
contributory factors in a considered manner by, in
effect, standing outside the situation.
Helping this group of teachers to revise their
thinking about classroom events became central.
This process took time and patience and effective
trainers. The researchers estimate that the initial
training of the teachers to view events objectively
took between 20 and 30 hours, with the same
number of hours again being required to practice
the skills of reflection.
Wildman and Niles identify three principles that
facilitate reflective practice in a teaching situation.
The first is support from administrators in an
education system, enabling teachers to understand
the requirements of reflective practice and how it
relates to teaching students. The second is the
availability of sufficient time and space. The
teachers in the program described how they found
it difficult to put aside the immediate demands of
others in order to give themselves the time they
needed to develop their reflective skills. The third is
the development of a collaborative environment
with support from other teachers. Support and
encouragement were also required to help
teachers in the program cope with aspects of their
professional life with which they were not
comfortable. Wildman and Niles make a summary
comment: “Perhaps the most important thing we
learned is the idea of the teacher-as-reflectivepractitioner will not happen simply because it is a
good or even compelling idea.”
The work of Wildman and Niles suggests the
importance of recognizing some of the difficulties of
instituting reflective practice. Others have noted
this, making a similar point about the teaching
profession’s cultural inhibitions about reflective
practice. Zeichner and Liston (1987) point out the
inconsistency between the role of the teacher as a
(reflective) professional decision maker and the
more usual role of the teacher as a technician,
putting into practice the ideas of theirs. More basic
than the cultural issues is the matter of motivation.
Becoming a reflective practitioner requires extra
work (Jaworski, 1993) and has only vaguely
defined goals with, perhaps, little initially
perceivable reward and the threat of vulnerability.
Few have directly questioned what might lead a
teacher to want to become reflective. Apparently,
the most obvious reason for teachers to work
toward reflective practice is that teacher educators
think it is a good thing. There appear to be many
unexplored matters about the motivation to reflect
– for example, the value of externally motivated
reflection as opposed to that of teachers who might
reflect by habit.
